    from the meads of the adjacent Severn to the ridge occupied by the
    castle, which rises 500 feet or 600 feet above, and half a mile west
    of, the river, from which it is separated by an intervening hill. The
    approach is by a steep road, which becomes still more so near the top
    of the ridge, and finally skirts along, and is commanded by, the works
    of the castle.</p>

  <p>These works are very simple in plan, and of rude construction. A
    platform about 200 yards long by 100 yards broad occupies the centre
    of the ridge. Its rocky sides are scarped and revetted all round to
    a height of about 10 feet, and upon this wall was built a curtain of
    from 20 to 30 feet more, and about 5 feet thick. At each end a cross
    ditch was quarried in the rock, so as to isolate the castle from the
    equally high ground beyond. Probably there were no bridges across these
    ditches, and the entrance seems to have been by a plain doorway in the
    curtain upon the northern face of the works. The curtain appears to
    have been quite plain, without either buttress or pilaster or flanking
    tower, save at the eastern end of the area, near the centre, where are
    the remains of a circular tower about 30 feet in diameter with walls 5
    feet thick. The curtain to the south, or most exposed, side is broken
    away; on the opposite side it is more perfect, and contains a doorway,
    broken, and now a mere hole in the wall. Within is a fragment of a
    building into which probably the gateway opened. The platform is very
    irregular, partly natural, chiefly from the heap of rubbish covering up
    the foundations of the domestic buildings. The building is not unlike
    Dinas Br√¢n and Dinas Powis, and is probably of the age of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, early in the reign. The material is the tile-stone of the
    country laid in courses. There is no sign of ashlar.</p>

  <p>Dolforwyn has no history. All that is known is that it was granted by
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> [7 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>] to Roger Mortimer of Wigmore as ‚Äúthe Castle of
    Dolvoron,‚Äù with the territories of Keddewy and Kery, to be held by the
    service of three knight‚Äôs-fees. In 14 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the castle was still
    held by a Mortimer, for Richard Labaunk was in prison at Wigmore, by
    reason of arrears in his account to Edmund de Mortimer whilst constable
    of his castle of Dolfnovan. He was liberated on bail. In 18 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>,
    Bogo de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> Knovill, being constable of Montgomery Castle, had a pardon
    for ¬£90 due on his farm of lands of Kery and Kidgewenny. This, however,
    was from the king, who seems to have resumed possession. Dugdale says
    the castle was built by David ap Llewelyn, who flourished 1240‚Äì46, but
    the Welsh attribute it to Bleddyn ap Cynfin between 1065 and 1073.
    Bleddyn may have had some kind of stronghold here, as a place very
    convenient for a raid upon the flat country, then held by the English;
    but he certainly did not build the existing walls. These are not
    unlikely to have been the work of Roger Mortimer, and their destruction
    probably followed at the first convenient opportunity. The name of
    the castle has not been found in the Mortimer inquisitions, nor is it
    mentioned save as above, among their possessions, or those of any other
    landowner. After the settlement of Wales it would cease to possess any
    value.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE tract of chalk which forms and gives character to the isle of
    Thanet and the south-eastern portion of the county of Kent, rises
    towards the sea to a line of cliffs upon which the promontories of the
    North and South Foreland and of Dover are the most conspicuous. The
    cliff line, however, is not continuous. It is broken at intervals by
    various valleys and gorges, down which the waters from the interior
    find their way to the sea, producing havens which in former days and
    for vessels of light burthen were much in request. Of these waters
    the chief is the Stour, which at no very remote period, near to the
    present Canterbury, fell into the head of a considerable estuary, the
    waters of which, guarded by the ancient fortresses Regulbium, Rutupi√¶
    and Lemanis, maintained Thanet as an island, and gave to the trade of
    the period free access to the interior of the district. This estuary
    was not exempt from the general tendency to become silted up. Before
    the Norman Conquest the waters had receded from Canterbury to the
    parish thence named Stourmouth, and Thanet from an island had become
    a peninsula. The process of silting up has been since continued, and
    the mouth of the Stour carried many miles lower. The river, after a
    very winding course, falls into and in part forms what remains of the
    ancient English port of Sandwich, opposite to the anchorage known as
    the Small Downs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

  <p>About three miles to the west of the South Foreland, another and much
    smaller stream, fed from the lower chalk and greensand, flows down a
    deep valley, and, reaching the sea between two considerable heights,
    has given origin to the port, town, and castle of Dover, so called,
    without doubt, by derivation from a British name represented in the
    Roman times by Dubris. The town and port lie deep in the valley. Of
    the heights, a part of that to the west has been rendered famous by
    Shakespeare, and has long borne his name. That to the east is known as
    the Castle Hill, so called from the fortress by which, under some form
    or other, it has been crowned from a very remote period. A position
    so convenient and so capable of defence would, upon any shore, have
    attracted the notice of the very earliest inhabitants; for not only
    was the height strong and the port convenient, but these advantages
    were found at the point at which the island approached nearest to the
    Continent, and at which those who crossed the straits, whether as
    friends or foes, would first make the land, and, if not obstructed,
    would come ashore. The position, therefore, was of far more than local
    importance, and would be sure to receive the attention not only of
    the chiefs of the Cantii, but of the rulers, if such there were, of
    the whole of Britain. It is therefore probable that haven, town, and
    fortress date from very nearly the first settlement of the country.</p>

  <p>Although the Western or Shakespeare‚Äôs Cliff is part of a larger range,
    the Castle Hill is better suited for defence. It is, in fact, an
    isolated knoll about 1,000 yards north and south, and 500 yards east
    and west, the summit being a steep and narrow ridge. Towards the south
    its boundary is the sea cliff, 320 feet high, and to the west the deep
    valley of the town. To the east and north are other valleys, less deep
    but by no means inconsiderable, and the sides of which are steep.
    Moreover, the whole hill is of chalk, that is to say, of a material
    easily scarped and capable of retaining any general outline to which it
    may be cut.</p>

  <p>But though, on general grounds, a very remote antiquity may safely
    be attributed to both town and fortress, it is difficult to find any
    precise or special evidence on which to rest the claim. Here, as at
    Durovernum or Canterbury, the Roman form indicates a British origin,
    and, if the ancient name of the stream be indeed, as asserted, the
    Dour, may well be derived from it, and the Castle Hill is just the
    place upon which a British camp is likely to be found. The commerce
    of the Britons, known to have been carried on with activity through
    the Cornish ports and the Isle of Wight, has also been claimed for the
    route through Dover. The actual present traces of British occupation
    in this southern country are indeed very scanty, and confined to a few
    names of rivers and hills, a very few of towns or villages, and to
    occasional entrenchments upon high ground, and of an irregular outline.
    The great roads, whatever their remote origin, in their present form
    carry the stamp of Rome upon every mile of their course, and the
    oldest known works in masonry are due to the same people, while the
    general topography,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> all that relates to property and self-government,
    hundreds, lathes, rapes and tythings, parish and hamlet, grange and
    farm, and the crowd of bourns, dens, hams, hangers, hirsts, ings, tons,
    wolds and worths point with overwhelming force to the English settlers.
    Even the tenure in gavelkind, claimed as a British custom, and known in
    Wales by the expressive name of ‚ÄúRandyr‚Äù or ‚Äúpartible‚Äù land, is by most
    legal antiquaries regarded as Teutonic.</p>

  <p>Although C√¶sar does not mention Dover by name, there can be no doubt
    that his fleet lay before it in August, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 55, the period of
    his first invasion of Britain. Dr. Guest has clearly demonstrated that
    the Portus Icius whence he sailed was a small and now silted-up haven
    between Cape Gris Nez, the Ician promontory, and Wissant, whence a ten
    hours‚Äô course brought him in the morning abreast of Dover. Here he
    found the natives, in great numbers and armed, drawn up to oppose his
    landing. He therefore anchored in Dover Wick, the roadstead east of the
    town, to give time for his slower ships to arrive, and thence proceeded
    to Deal, where he probably landed with two legions, or from eight
    to ten thousand men. Dr. Guest has pointed out that the word Icius
    coincides closely with the Irish name for the English Channel, ‚ÄúMuir
    n‚ÄôIcht,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Ician Sea,‚Äù ‚Äúicht‚Äù being a form of ‚Äúuch‚Äù or ‚Äúucha,‚Äù upper
    in height, which plays so important a part in the names of places in
    Wales and the north of Scotland. It was natural that the Channel should
    be named from its most remarkable feature, and to this day its name in
    Dutch is <span lang="nl">‚ÄúDe Hofden,‚Äù</span> or ‚Äúthe heights.‚Äù</p>

  <p>C√¶sar stayed but three weeks in the country, and may not have visited
    Dover; but as, when he returned in the following year with a much
    larger force, he seems to have embarked and landed at the same points,
    he must have been familiar with the aspect of the port from the sea.
    As on this occasion he traversed Kent and crossed the Thames, he
    probably left no dangerous force behind him at Dover, which he does
    not mention, and which clearly was not then made a rallying point by
    the Britons. Had the heights been held in force, he would probably in
    the first instance have reduced them, or at any rate have mentioned
    the fact in his narrative. During the century that followed C√¶sar‚Äôs
    appearance, Rome took no active part in British affairs, but it is
    probable that a considerable trade sprang up between the island and
    the Continent, and the Britons made great advances in commerce and
    civilisation. Towns were founded and coins struck. The next military
    invasion took place, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 43, ninety-eight years after the
    first appearance of C√¶sar, and under the reign of Claudian, and command
    of Aulus Plautius, who landed with four legions. The Cantii then held
    a tract nearly corresponding to the present county of Kent. Durovernum
    had been founded amidst its indigenous alders, and Camalodunum, beyond
    the Thames, was the chief city of the Trinobantes. Where Plautius
    landed is not precisely known. Probably at several points on the open
    beach between Rich borough and Laymen. Whether the Britons mustered north
    or south of the Thames is also un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>known; but, when Claudian followed
    his lieutenant, the way lay open to that river, and he marched at once
    upon Camalodunum, where the Trinobantes were put to flight. Plautius
    probably subdued the country as far west as the Axe and the Tamar,
    and his progress may, it is thought, be traced by the remains of his
    rectangular camps opposed to those of larger area and irregular outline
    thrown up by the retiring Britons. As, in the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
    40, Caligula had caused a lighthouse to be set up on the heights of
    Boulogne, it is not improbable that Plautius was the builder of the
    corresponding tower at Dover.</p>

  <p>Ostorius Scapula is said to have occupied with a camp the Castle Hill.
    He, Suetonius Paulinus, and Agricola were busied mainly with the
    midland and northern parts of the island, and the southern province,
    Britannia Prima, seems to have been at peace. Roads were laid out,
    towns built, the metals were smelted, and agriculture prospered.
    Dubris (Dover), Durobrivis (Rochester), Rutupi√¶ (Richborough), Lemanis
    (Lymne), Regulbium (Reculver), and Anderida (Pevensey), came afterwards
    into notice as towns or havens. The Watling Street, which ran from
    Canterbury by Rochester northwards, seems to have been commenced
    at Dover. There were indeed roads from Canterbury to Lymne and to
    Richborough, but Dover would be the port reached by the production
    of the road in a straight line from Canterbury. In the reign of
    Valentinian, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 364‚Äì7, a cohort of the Second Legion of
    1,100 men was stationed at Dubris, where stamped tiles show them to
    have built a bath, and which is mentioned as a port in the Iter of
    Antoninus and as a town (civitas) by the geographer of Ravenna. In
    the time of Constantine, Dubris was one of the six ports south of
    Thanet, under the Count of the Saxon shore, the others being Rutupi√¶,
    Regulbium, Lemanis, Anderida, and Adurnus (Portsmouth). It is, however,
    not included in the list of the twenty-eight towns existing when the
    Romans retired from Britain, of which Rutupi√¶ was one. Still, even
    if Dubris were one only of three heads of the Watling Street, its
    importance under the Roman sway was considerable.</p>

  <p>To the Roman period is to be referred the burial-ground laid open near
    the edge of the cliff in 1797, and the bath discovered on the brook
    west of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs Church. No mention is made of a Roman fortress,
    nor was it in accordance with the practice of that people to place
    a permanent camp, still less a military station, upon a height so
    inaccessible as the Castle Hill. The existing earthworks show no traces
    of Roman outline, nor, when they had possession of the whole district,
    was there any need to fortify the lighthouse. The lighthouse alone, of
    the works upon the hill, can with certainty be pronounced to be Roman,
    but this, of course, implies the existence and employment of the port.
    All that the topographer can affirm is that the earthworks do not now
    present, and, so far as description may be relied on, do not appear
    ever to have presented, anything of a Roman character.</p>

  <p>Kent was probably the part of Britain first invaded by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> Northmen,
    and certainly the first actually subdued and settled. It was the only
    independent state established and maintained by the followers of
    Hengist, the Jutes, a people who did not contribute largely to the
    conquest of Britain, neither did they occupy any considerable portion
    of the conquered country; but what they did retain became and still
    remains intensely Teutonic, and their early supremacy, during the
    conversion of the English to Christianity, is marked by the fact that
    their chief city became, as it has since remained, the ecclesiastical
    metropolis of the island. Dover was a considerable Jutish port, and
    before long was regarded as the key of England. Very probably the
    inner earthworks still to be seen, though too much altered to be
    recognisable, were the work of this people, and the collegiate church
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin, founded in the town by Wihtr√¶d, King of Kent (690‚Äì725),
    is said to have been removed by him from the Castle Hill. In the time
    of Alfred, Dover was placed in the bailiwick of Stouting, and the
    lathe of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine. Its history, however, properly so called, does
    not begin till the reign of the Confessor, whose charter to the Cinque
    Ports, which John is said to have inspected, was confirmed by many
    later kings.</p>

  <p>In September, 1051, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, brother-in-law to
    King Edward, paid a visit to the English Court at Gloucester, and
    returning through Canterbury there rested his escort, and thence went
    to Dover on his way homeward. Before entering the town, he and his men
    put on their coats of mail, and attempted to take free quarters in
    the houses of the burghers. This led to a fight in which much blood
    was shed, and the Count finally, being expelled the town, returned
    to Gloucester with his complaint. The subsequent tale has often been
    told. Godwin, then Earl of Kent, took part with his injured countrymen,
    and withstood the strong Norman interest about the king, and was, in
    consequence, banished. Godwin proposed, says Malmesbury, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Ut magnates
    illius castelli blande in curia regis de seditione convenirentur</span>.‚Äù
    Whether ‚Äú<span lang="la">castellum</span>‚Äù can be taken for more than the fortified town is
    uncertain. It is not probable that Eustace would have ascended to the
    castle, since he sought quarters in the town. On the whole this passage
    can scarcely be taken to prove the existence at that time of a regular
    castle on the hill. Nevertheless, the existence of such a castle at
    that time is exceedingly probable, for in 1064‚Äì65 Harold, says William
    of Poitiers, swore to Duke William that, on the death of the Confessor,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">se ... traditurum interim ipsius militum custodi√¶ castrum Doveram,
    studio atque sumptu suo communitum, item per diversa loca illius terr√¶
    alia castra</span>.‚Äù Eadmer is more precise. In his account Duke William
    insists, ‚Äú<span lang="la">et insuper castellum Dofris cum puteo aqu√¶ ad opus meum te
    facturum</span>.‚Äù Malmesbury says, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Castellum Doroberni√¶ (Dubris) quod ad jus
    suum pertineret</span>.‚Äù Here there can be no mistake as to what is meant. A
    well in the town could be of no special value, but a well on a chalk
    hill 290 feet above the water springs was an addition to the castle
    worthy of special notice. Such a well, moreover, was a very laborious
    work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> and must have taken some time to complete. Harold‚Äôs oath is
    no doubt involved in a good deal of doubt and uncertainty, but the
    tale may at least be taken to show that there was, before the Norman
    conquest, a castle upon the hill, now crowned by the Norman keep, and
    that it had been strengthened by Harold. Malmesbury here, as in his
    account of the fray with Count Eustace, for Dover puts Canterbury,
    evidently in error.</p>

  <p>Domesday Book opens with Dover. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Dovere tempore regis Edwardi</span>,‚Äù <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>
    That king held two parts of half its rents, and Earl Godwin the other
    third, that is, the earl‚Äôs penny. The burgesses provided the king with
    twenty ships annually for fifteen days, in each twenty-one men. The
    king‚Äôs messengers also had certain valuable privileges, showing that
    the port lay in the usual route to the Continent. There was a mill at
    the entry to the port, much in the way of the shipping. The castle
    is not mentioned, but we read of the Gildhalla, or Guildhall, of the
    burgesses. The town, though thriving, had recently been burned, and the
    rent reduced in consequence.</p>

  <p>The Normans landed, as their Teutonic ancestors had landed centuries
    before them, beneath the ancient walls of the Roman Anderida, which,
    under the name of Pevensey, had become an English, and was to become
    ere long a Norman fortress. Pevensey is a haven no longer, but within
    its circuit may still be seen huge fragments of Roman and Norman
    masonry, and the simpler, but, at least, equally durable mound of
    its English occupants, a grand and striking composition, and, to the
    instructed observer, eloquent of great events. William took possession
    of the ruins, and, on the following day, marched upon the battlefield,
    hastily fortifying with wood and earth the hill of Hastings in support
    of his position. After the battle Romney first felt the weight of the
    Conqueror‚Äôs hand, and he then turned to Dover. The castle was, says
    William of Poitiers, impregnable, and the town even then considerable;
    but the people, though assembled in vast numbers, had no leaders, and
    town and castle were at once surrendered, though in the transfer,
    either by design or accident, much of the town was burned. William
    paused here eight days, detained by sickness among his troops. He
    treated the people with great lenity, placed a Norman garrison in the
    castle, to the defences of which he added, and then proceeded towards
    the Thames, receiving the submission of Canterbury and Rochester on his
    way. Kent was placed under the command of Bishop Odo, who held Dover as
    its military centre. This continued to be its position, and in 1074,
    when the fierce Jutish blood broke out, and the men of Kent, headed
    by Eustace of Boulogne, rose against William, their first object was
    to gain Dover Castle, to which they laid siege. Its defences, whether
    English or Norman, were strong, but the attack was sharp. Bishop Odo
    and Hugh de Montfort, who had the castle in charge, were absent, but
    they exerted themselves in the county, and the castle was relieved.
    Towards the end of the reign the town is said to have been walled,
    and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> have had ten gates. Its position, as the most important of
    the Cinque Ports, seems to have been established, to which its castle
    largely contributed. The five ports were Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover
    and Sandwich. Winchelsea and Rye were among the members. Their service
    was to provide fifty-seven ships annually, of which number Dover
    furnished twenty-one.</p>

  <p>Important as the castle continued to be under the reigns of the
    Plantagenet and Tudor kings, its history does not possess any very
    particular interest. It was not the scene of any very remarkable event,
    and, though accounted the key of the kingdom, was not in any very
    intimate manner bound up with its history. It has always been held by
    the Crown and governed by a constable, usually a man of eminence, of
    which officials Lyon gives a list of 138. Three barons of the house
    of Fiennes held the office under the Conqueror, Rufus, and Henry
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and in their time seem to have been built the outer curtain and
    many of its towers. Walchelin Magminot, placed in office by Stephen,
    held the place against him in 1137, and in 1138 surrendered it to
    the queen, just before the battle of the Standard. Stephen died at
    Dover, probably in the castle, and Mr. Puckle has fought gallantly for
    the recent discovery of his remains. Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> is supposed to have
    built the keep and the wall of the inner ward in 1154, soon after his
    accession to the crown, and, if so, it was probably the actual work of
    one of the Barons Fiennes, who held the office of constable in that
    reign. Of these lords, the last, James Fiennes, was constable at the
    accession of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and in 1191 received, as a prisoner in the
    castle, Geoffrey, Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>‚Äôs natural son, on his way to take up the
    archbishopric of York. He was taken from the sanctuary of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin‚Äôs
    church, and imprisoned by order of the Bishop of Ely, the chancellor.
    For this outrage Fiennes was suspended, and eventually the chancellor
    was excommunicated and banished. In 1198 the constable was one of the
    five officers appointed to inspect the treasures of the church of
    Canterbury. In the reign of John, the constable was Hubert de Burgh, to
    whom it fell to defend the castle against Prince Louis and the French
    invaders. Louis made great attempts to win over De Burgh to his party,
    but without success, and upon his final refusal he laid siege to the
    castle. <em>Trebuchets</em> and <em>petraria</em>, and much siege artillery
    were brought over from France, and a covered way was run along the
    slope outside the castle ditch on the north-west quarter. Wooden towers
    (<em>Malvoisins</em>) also were erected on the edge of the ditch to quell
    the fire from the walls, which were actually shaken by strokes of the
    ram. Also a small colony was established in temporary huts, so as to
    give the siege the aspect of a blockade. Hubert, however, was a true
    and loyal subject of England. He regarded his charge as held under
    his sovereign, whoever that sovereign might be, and his castle as the
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">clavis Angli√¶ et repagulum</span>.‚Äù He returned attack for attack, stone
    for stone, until the death of John, by removing much of the cause of
    dissatisfaction, led to the retirement of the French from the country.
    The great spur-work in advance of the northern gateway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> and which
    still, though much altered, remains, is probably the work of De Burgh,
    no doubt suggested to him by the direction of the French attack. Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> was here in state in 1255, on his way from Spain, and in 1259
    the castle was in the hands of the barons, who refused to allow his
    brother Richard, King of the Romans, to enter the place until he had
    sworn to adopt their cause. Henry recovered the castle in 1261 from
    Hugh le Bigot, but was unable to hold it, and was refused admission
    when, with his brother and the Earl Mareschal, he presented himself
    before the gate in 1263. In the great struggle, Henry held the Tower of
    London, and the barons the castle of Dover. After Lewes, the Princes
    Edward and Henry were for a time held in durance in Dover. In 1265,
    when the prince had the upper hand, and Kenilworth had fallen, fourteen
    nobles of the royal party were imprisoned in the keep of Dover. Here
    they defended themselves, turning the tables upon their captors, who,
    attacked from without by Prince Edward, and thus placed between two
    fires, surrendered the castle. The Countess of Leicester, who was
    within it, was allowed to retire to France.</p>

  <p>On his return from Palestine, after his father‚Äôs death, in the summer
    of 1274, Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> landed at Dover. He again visited the castle in
    1278, 1296, and 1299. Dover was his usual port when he visited or
    returned from the Continent, and in his time the castle was maintained
    and strengthened, and some of its most considerable parts, such as the
    Constable‚Äôs Gate and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs Postern, are of the conclusion of the
    reign of Henry or early in that of Edward, and most probably the latter.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> was here in the January following his father‚Äôs death, and
    here he embarked for Boulogne on the occasion of his marriage in 1308,
    and here he received the queen. Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> was not infrequently at
    Dover, but is more likely to have lodged in the Maison Dieu than in the
    castle. He probably drew troops from hence when he sailed from the port
    on his celebrated secret expedition to Calais in 1348. In the reign of
    Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> the Emperor Sigismond was received at the castle as a visitor,
    and from hence the king embarked his army for France in 1421, as did
    Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr> in 1491.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> suppressed the Maison Dieu, the celebrated foundation of
    Hubert de Burgh, within which very many kings and princes had been
    entertained, but the castle was an object of his special care, and was
    repaired and garrisoned. Henry also built the blockhouses of Sandown,
    Deal, Walmer, and Sandgate, and placed them under the charge of the
    Constable of Dover. Three bulwarks also were constructed under the
    cliff and upon the pier of the harbour. Later on the castle fell into
    neglect, and in the reign of Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, being garrisoned by a small
    force, and but little cared for, it was taken by surprise and held for
    the Parliament. In 1648 the Kentish royalists made a vigorous effort to
    recover it, but were repulsed by Algernon Sydney, then its governor.</p>

  <h3>DESCRIPTION.</h3>

  <p>Dover Castle is called by Matthew Paris ‚Äúthe very front door of
    England,‚Äù and described by William of Poitou as ‚Äú<span lang="la">Situm est id castellum
    in rupe mari contigua qu√¶ naturaliter acuta undique ad hoc ferramentis
    elaborate incisa, in speciem muri directissima altitudine, quantum
    sagitt√¶ jactus permetiri potest consurgit, quo in latere unda marina
    alluitur</span>.‚Äù It presents a good combination of the defences of several
    architectural periods, the general result being a concentric fortress,
    the growth of many centuries, and which, a century ago, presented
    much both of earthwork and masonry of great and unmixed antiquarian
    interest. More recently, however, the works have been delivered over
    to the military authorities of the country, and the result has been
    a series of alterations, additions, and removals, necessary, it is
    in all courtesy to be presumed, for the defence of the country, but
    very destructive of the ancient features of the fortress. The ancient
    earthworks have been scarped, extended, retrenched, and tunnelled,
    barracks and magazines have been built, the keep has been converted
    into storerooms and water-tanks, and in its basement are two powder
    magazines. In its present condition, and having regard to the strict
    regulations, prohibiting even the use of the pencil, under which the
    whole is placed, an accurate examination of what remains of the ancient
    works, whether in earth or masonry, is almost impracticable.</p>

  <p>The British camp was oblong, following the figure of the hill. It was
    composed of a deep and broad ditch, the contents of which were in part
    thrown inwards and upwards so as to form a bank. The area thus enclosed
    measured within the bank about 875 yards by 350 yards, the latter being
    its diameter at the cliff, by which it is cut off, the northern end
    running to a point. This main ditch has probably been deepened and more
    or less altered during the Norman period, and it is now connected with
    various bastions, hornworks, and caponni√®res, but its general outline
    is sufficiently clear, and it may, from internal evidence, be presumed
    to be British. Within the area, rather nearer to its northern end, a
    second earthwork, also composed of bank and ditch, has been thrown up.
    This includes the lighthouse tower, and is therefore called the Roman
    ditch, but there is nothing about it of a Roman character, and it is
    far more probable that it was the work of the English, and formed the
    inner defence of the castle which Harold undertook to surrender. The
    space between this and the great earthwork forms the outer ward of the
    Norman castle; the inner work has been divided into two parts. That
    to the south, containing the lighthouse, forms the middle ward; that
    to the north contains the keep, and is the inner ward. The lighthouse
    has been employed as a belfry to the adjacent church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary,
    which is the subject of an excellent memoir by Mr. Puckle, though he
    can scarcely be admitted to establish its connexion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> the British
    church. The two are undoubtedly the oldest buildings within the castle
    area.</p>

  <p>The <em>Keep</em> and <em>Inner Ward</em> are Norman, of the reign of
    Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, but the curtain and most of its towers have been refaced
    or rebuilt, a great part recently, but more or less on the old lines.
    The plan is an irregular polygon, about 120 yards each way, with
    fourteen rectangular mural towers of no internal projection, and not
    rising above the curtain, which, however, is lofty. Two of those to the
    south-west take their name from Magminot and one from Gore. The walls
    were of flint rubble, quoined with ashlar, and battering outside at
    the base, the top of which is marked by a bold cordon of stone. Upon
    the sides of some of the towers are bold machicolated openings from
    garderobes. The keep stands detached in the centre of the ward, and
    within the area, built against the walls, are several buildings, as
    Arthur‚Äôs Hall, the guard chamber, and the officers‚Äô quarters, some of
    early English character, others modern.</p>

  <p>There are two entrances, the north, or King‚Äôs Gate, and the south, the
    Duke of Suffolk‚Äôs, or Palace Gate. The gateways are vaulted passages,
    with a flat segmental arch, opening externally between two square
    flanking towers. There is a groove for a portcullis, and the vaults
    have an early English import. Each of these gates is defended by an
    additional work. A sort of hornwork is thrown out in advance, enclosed
    within a wall with towers, and with a second gate placed obliquely to
    the first, to allow the approach to be commanded. The north, called
    the King‚Äôs Gate, is tolerably perfect. The southern outwork is nearly
    destroyed. It had two gates, one to the south, connected with which was
    the tower containing a well, and one to the east, called King Arthur‚Äôs
    Gate, close to which was the Armourer‚Äôs Tower, and near this was Earl
    Godwin‚Äôs Postern. The masonry of this inner ward was probably of the
    date of the keep. It was included within a broad and deep ditch, now
    incomplete, on the southern front.</p>

  <p>The <em>Middle Ward</em> includes the southern half of what was probably
    the English earthwork. Its southern two-thirds is rounded, but at its
    base are, or were, walls and towers connecting it right and left with
    the curtain of the outer ward, which it thus divided into two parts.
    In advance of this work were three towers: two, to the east and west,
    Clinton and Mortimer, were square. Both seem to have been of Norman
    date. The central tower to the south was circular, and was called
    Valence. It was, no doubt, later, probably of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    The foundations of Clinton Tower were laid open and removed in 1794. A
    fragment of Mortimer‚Äôs Tower remains. Valence Tower was destroyed in
    the last century. The gatehouse of the ward is called Colton Gate. It
    is Norman, but an octagonal story has been added to the square base.
    The curtain connecting these towers is gone, and the lofty south bank
    has been scarped, and its outline changed. In this ward is a well 380
    feet deep, once covered by a tower.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em> is contained within a curtain, much of which is
    reduced by an internal ramp to a parapet wall. Upon the three landward
    sides it is narrow, and chiefly occupied by the ditch of the middle
    and inner wards. Upon the remaining or southern side it expands and
    includes a large space between the middle ward and the cliff. Its
    circuit is only not complete because its walls rest at either end
    upon the cliff. The plan of the wall is irregular, with an occasional
    angle or shoulder for raking the ditch. Exteriorly it rises from
    the outer dry ditch, and upon it are twenty-seven towers of various
    dates, figures, and dimensions, square, circular, and multiangular.
    Most of those on the western face are simply hollow bastions, and
    have no internal projection. Those on the eastern face are mostly
    mere sentry-boxes, or bartizan turrets of small dimensions. Upon the
    seaward front, where the cliff is perpendicular, there is no wall.
    The ingenuity of the engineer has been exercised on the landward and
    weaker sides. Five of the towers are connected with gates. These
    towers, commencing at the south-west angle of the ward, near the cliff,
    are: 1. Canon‚Äôs or Monk‚Äôs Gate, now destroyed; in it was a well. 2.
    Rokesley‚Äôs Tower, semicircular. 3. Fulbert de Dover‚Äôs Tower, square;
    near which was long the office of the ‚Äúbodar,‚Äù or sergeant-at-arms, to
    whom all civil warrants of arrest for debt or breach of the revenue
    laws were addressed. Fulbert‚Äôs Tower was also his prison. 4. Hirst‚Äôs
    Tower, semicircular; it commands a shoulder or re-entering angle in the
    wall. 5. Arsick‚Äôs Tower, semicircular. 6. Gatton Tower. 7. Peverill‚Äôs,
    Beauchamp‚Äôs, or Marshall‚Äôs Tower. This is also the gatehouse between
    the two divisions of the outer ward, which was strong, with a ditch on
    the south front, and a drawbridge. It was also the marshal‚Äôs prison.
    8. Port, Gosling, or Queen Mary‚Äôs Tower, having been repaired by that
    sovereign. 9. Fiennes‚Äôs Tower, or the Constable‚Äôs Gate. This is one
    of the grandest gateways in England. It is in plan a triangle with
    its obtuse angle presented to the field. The angles at the base fall
    within the line of the curtain, and are capped by two large drum
    towers. The salient angle in like manner is capped by an oblong tower,
    rounded at each end and flat in the centre, through which the entrance
    passes. These three towers are large and lofty, and are connected by
    an embattled curtain. Within the triangle a central tower rises to a
    still greater height, and commands the whole. The entrance passage is
    broad and vaulted, and provided with gates and a portcullis. Within, it
    opens upon the level of the outer ward; without, it terminates abruptly
    upon the scarp of the ditch, there about 50 feet deep. From this
    gateway a bridge communicates with the opposite bank. A single lofty
    pier rises from the centre of the ditch, and from it an arch springs
    to the outer abutment, carrying a regular roadway and parapets. In the
    opposite direction the parapets alone spring, as two arches, from the
    pier to the gateway, and serve to steady the pier, but the roadway is
    omitted, and its place supplied by a drawbridge. This arrangement is
    not uncommon, but is here specially necessary, owing to the height
    and consequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> weakness of the pier. Upon the counterscarp of the
    ditch is a <i lang="fr">t√™te-de-pont</i>, from which a steep road descends by a
    traverse towards the town. This gate, though open, is but little used.
    The ordinary gate is modern, and near the site of Canon‚Äôs Gate. The
    Constable‚Äôs Gate is of the Decorated period. Its interior is said to be
    very curious, but is not shown.</p>

  <p>Sixteen towers, including Clopton, Godsfoe, Magminot (4), and
    Crevequer‚Äôs Towers (2), protect the north-west face. Clopton is a
    hexagon; the name of Magminot is borne by four towers. The two towers
    bearing the name of Crevequer mark the position of the great postern,
    a very curious work. Passing from the north gate of the inner ward,
    a range of arches cross the ditch and the outer ward, and terminate
    abruptly in a large low pier with salient angles to the right and
    left. Opposite to the pier, and no doubt at one time connected with
    it by a drawbridge, rise a pair of circular towers (Crevequer),
    connected by a heavy curtain and flanked by lesser towers (Magminot)
    at short distances, all forming part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the
    outer ward. Towards the field the curtain has a salient angle, and
    from its base a covered gallery descends into the outer ditch, and
    there reaches <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs, a drum tower built in the middle of it. The
    gallery passes through the first story of the tower, and terminates
    in the counterscarp, in a circular chamber cut in the chalk, and from
    this chamber three tunnels radiate to different parts of the glacis,
    of which one formerly led to a distant postern, and another still
    communicates with the old spur-work, attributed to Hubert de Burgh,
    and converted into a modern ravelin. Two other tunnels, apparently of
    Edwardian date, leave the main gallery under the castle wall, and the
    basement floor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs contains two sally ports, opening into the
    bottom of the ditch. The modern access to these galleries is by a shaft
    sunk in the pier of the old drawbridge, but the old entrance was nearer
    the curtain. The French siege of 1216 was directed upon this quarter.
    The approaches were made from the west below the Constable‚Äôs Gate, and
    under cover of a trench and breastwork. While the attack was impending
    Sir Stephen de Pencester brought a reinforcement into the castle by the
    postern under Godwin‚Äôs Tower. De Burgh, taught by experience, threw
    up the advanced work which still, under a changed form, covers the
    northern end of the castle, and it was to reach this in safety that the
    gallery from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs Tower was executed.</p>

  <p>Fitzwilliam‚Äôs Tower (18), placed about 80 yards east of the north
    gate, was connected with a second postern, not unlike the last, and
    now connected with a caponni√®re. Beyond this are 19 and 20, two
    watch turrets, and farther on 21, Albrinci‚Äôs or Avrenches‚Äô Tower.
    This contains a third postern of peculiar arrangement. It is a low,
    polygonal structure, placed on a shoulder on the ditch, so as to
    rake its continuation southward. It was reached by a covered gallery
    from the south gate of the inner ward, which is continued through
    its basement so as to open on the counterscarp of the main ditch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
    Connected with this gallery was Veville or Pencester‚Äôs Tower, placed
    upon the curtain which on this side closed the connexion between the
    two divisions of the outer ward. Of the remaining towers, five in
    number, three are called Ashford‚Äôs, and near one of them was another
    well. This part of the defence has been completely remodelled. The
    names of the several towers are those of the knights by whom they
    were built, or whose duty it was to defend them, for to no castle
    in Britain, not even to Richmond, was the practice of tenure by
    castle guard so extensively applied as to Dover, and very numerous
    and valuable were the Kentish manors so held, amounting to 230¬Ω
    knight-fees, of which 115¬º were attached to the office of Constable.</p>

  <p>The <em>Keep</em>.‚ÄîThis is a very fine example of a late Norman keep. It
    is very nearly square, being, at the base above the plinth, 98 feet
    north and south by 96 feet east and west, with a forebuilding 15 feet
    broad by 115 feet long, which covers the east side and the south-east
    angle of the main structure. The angles are capped by pilasters 19 feet
    broad and of 5 feet projection, which meet to form a solid angle, and,
    rising to the summit, become the outer faces of four square turrets. On
    each of the three free faces is an intermediate pilaster, 15 feet broad
    by 5 feet projection, which rises to the same height with the parapet,
    and forms a bay in its line. There is a battering plinth, 6 feet high,
    from which the pilasters rise, and the total height of the wall is 83
    feet, and of the turrets 12 feet more, or 95 feet. The base of the keep
    is 373 feet above high-water mark. The top of the plinth is marked, on
    the face of the pilasters, by a bold cordon or roll, and there are two
    sets-off of 6 inches common to both walls and pilasters, one at the
    first and the other at the second-floor level. The walls are of unusual
    thickness, even for a Norman keep. That to the west, between the
    pilasters, is 21 feet reduced to 19 feet at the first and to 18 feet at
    the second floor. The north wall is 17 feet, the south 19 feet, and the
    east 18 feet. The cross wall, which runs north and south, and divides
    the building nearly equally, is 11 feet at the base, and reduced to 7
    feet and 6 feet at the top story.</p>

  <p>The main entrance is in the east face, near its north end, at the
    second-floor level. The forebuilding which covers it is the finest in
    England. It is in fair preservation, all but its roofs and part of
    its east wall, which are modern. As at Rochester, it is of masonry
    inferior to the keep, at least outside, and there is no cordon at the
    base of its pilasters, but it contains within more ornamental work than
    the keep, with which it is so intimately connected that it cannot be
    an addition. In the north-east and south-west angles of the keep are
    well-staircases remarkably commodious and well lighted. They are 14
    feet 6 inches in diameter, the stairs being 6 feet 6 inches and the
    newel 1 foot 6 inches. They rise from the basement to the roof by 114
    steps, and communicate with each floor, the two lower by lobbies, the
    upper and upper gallery by branching passages. From the north-east
    lobbies doors open into <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>the two tiers of vaults below the upper
    part of the forebuilding. The extraordinary thickness of the walls
    is intended to allow of the construction of a very unusual number of
    mural chambers, of which there are altogether twenty-seven. Besides the
    main entrance there seems to have been one at the first-floor level,
    also from the forebuilding. Others have since been made, one probably
    in the fourteenth century, direct into the basement, and another very
    recently into the base of the south-western staircase. Besides these,
    divers loopholes have been converted into doors, to give external
    entrance to the basement mural chambers which are used as water-tanks
    and powder-magazines.</p>

  <p>The <em>basement</em>.‚ÄîThere is some doubt about the original level of
    this floor. At present it is 9 feet above the ground outside, but it
    contains two doors, the sills of which are 6 feet or 8 feet below the
    floor, and on opening the ground near the centre of the keep a pavement
    was found at the same level, so that the floor may have been filled in
    with earth and raised. If so, however, there must have been some kind
    of stair to supplement the well staircases, for the floor of their
    lobbies is certainly at its original level. The cross-wall between the
    two chambers is pierced by three plain round-headed arches of 11 feet
    opening.</p>

  <p>The east chamber, 50 feet by 20 feet, has in its north end a deep
    recess, and a loop up to which the sill is stepped, while the arch
    overhead rises as the recess contracts. It is evident that the recess
    at the south end was similar, but has been converted into a doorway.
    This is the opening in general use, from the first landing of the
    exterior staircase. The wall here is 24 feet thick, and there are
    rebates for two doors, with bars within each. The arches are segmental
    and the angles rounded off. The alteration seems to have been made in
    the Decorated period, with a trace of later work. Close east of this
    door, and 6 feet below it, is another door, now partially concealed,
    which led into a vault 28 feet by 15 feet, occupying the south-east
    angle of the building. In its south wall a door leads into a second
    vault, 23 feet by 15 feet, below the lower vestibule and chapel. Each
    vault had a loop towards the east. They are now used as water-tanks,
    and reached by external openings. Returning to the east chamber, in
    its east wall are two doors, one at its north end and one near the
    middle, now blocked up. The northern door opens into the lobby of the
    north-east staircase, and from it a door led into a vault 28 feet by 12
    feet, in the forebuilding, now used as a magazine, and entered through
    the outer wall. The middle door probably led into another vault, of
    which nothing is known. Thus at the ground level of the forebuilding
    there are three, if not four vaults, all originally entered from the
    keep. They are about 6 feet high to the arch-springing.</p>

  <p>The west chamber, 50 feet by 16 feet, has a large recess and loop in
    each end, and in the west wall two doors, one opening into the lobby of
    the south-western staircase, where is the modern door, and the other,
    now blocked up, which led into a mural chamber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> 39 feet long by 12 feet
    broad, now a powder-magazine, and entered from the outside.</p>

  <p>The first floor also contains two main rooms which communicate by a
    small door near the north end of the cross-wall.</p>

  <p>The east chamber, 53 feet by 22 feet, has a recess 7 feet wide in
    its south end, which ended in a loop, now converted into a window.
    In its right or west jamb is a fireplace; in its left a door opening
    into a mural chamber 18 feet by 11 feet, with a loop to the south,
    and from the east end of which a door opens upon a staircase of the
    forebuilding. This door and the window above it are of Tudor date, but
    there are indications that there was an original door here, of which
    the Tudor frame is a replacement. In the exterior wall is an arch of
    relief in fine ashlar, which matches in size with the vault within, and
    looks as though intended to protect an original door. In the east wall
    of the great chamber is a door opening into the lobby, in which six
    steps descend to the north-east staircase. From this lobby a door leads
    into a vault 24 feet by 12 feet, with a recess in its north and south
    walls, and a loop in its east end. From this a short passage leads into
    a second vault, 17 feet by 2 feet, with a loop to the north. These two
    vaults are placed below the upper vestibule and great guard-room of
    the forebuilding. In the north wall of the great chamber, at the east
    end, a small door opens into a mural gallery, 16 feet by 4 feet, with a
    loop to the north, and which ends in a chamber 5 feet by 6 feet, also
    with a loop to the north. Above this gallery is a recess 7 feet wide,
    raised about 10 feet from the floor, to clear the gallery. Its loop is
    replaced by a modern window.</p>

  <p>The west chamber, 52 feet by 20 feet, has also a 7-feet recess in
    its south end, with a modern window, and in its east jamb a door
    opening into a mural chamber, 13 feet by 9 feet, with a south loop,
    and a fireplace in the east wall. This, and the fireplace already
    mentioned, are placed back to back, and, though with Tudor fittings,
    may possibly be original. In the north wall of the great chamber is a
    high recess and window, similar to that in the east chamber. In the
    west wall are four openings; that at its north end opens into a chamber
    in the north-west angle, 23 feet by 10 feet, with loops to the west
    and south. From it branches a passage 18 feet by 4 feet, in the north
    wall, which leads under the high window recess to a chamber 7 feet by
    6 feet. Both passage and chamber have loops to the north. Next follows
    a window recess of 6-feet opening at the floor level, rising by four
    steps to the modern window; then a door opening into a mural chamber,
    20 feet by 9 feet, with a fireplace in the east wail and two loops to
    the west. Finally is a door opening upon the lobby which leads to the
    south-west staircase, rising three steps, and having a loop to the
    west. Besides the three fireplaces in mural chambers, there were two
    others under arches of 12 feet span, one in the centre of each face of
    the cross-wall. These, however, are closed up. In the same wall, at the
    north end, is a door between the two chambers.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

  <p>The second floor is the main or state floor of the building, and
    that into which opens the great entrance. As in the keeps of London,
    Rochester, and Hedingham, it had two tiers of windows, the upper
    passing through a mural gallery. Early in the present century this
    floor was covered in by two large brick vaults, slightly pointed. The
    object was to convert the ramparts into a platform for cannon. This
    clumsy addition completely conceals the upper half of the walls and
    destroys the effect of two very fine chambers.</p>

  <p>The east chamber, 55 feet by 24 feet, is entered on the east side, near
    the north end, by a large, full-centred doorway, flanked outside by
    nook shafts. From this a vaulted passage, 5 feet broad, traverses the
    wall, here 16 feet thick, and descends by eight steps into the main
    chamber. This inconvenient height was evidently given to secure headway
    for the vault below the vestibule. In the entrance passage, on the left
    or south side, a door opens into the well chamber, a vault, 16 feet
    by 8 feet, with a loop to the east upon the great staircase. At the
    south end of the vault, upon a step, is the well, 4 feet diameter and
    289 feet deep, lined, as far as can be seen, with ashlar. In the east
    wall is a recess for a spare bucket. Near the entrance, at the north
    end of the east wall of the great chamber, a door leads into a curved
    passage which descends eleven steps into the north-east staircase. At
    the south end of the same wall a large arch, 5 feet above the floor,
    opens into a mural chamber 8 feet by 7 feet. This arch has been reduced
    by modern brickwork, to support the great vault. In the same chamber a
    loop opens upon the grand staircase, and in the south wall is a door
    and a descent by eight steps towards the chapel. It is possible that
    the loop was originally a small door leading into the upper floor of
    the middle tower of the forebuilding, and that thence, in Tudor days, a
    small wooden gallery led to the north door of the ante-chapel. In the
    south end of the great chamber is a window recess of 7 feet, opening
    with nearly flat sides. In its west jamb is a fireplace, in the east a
    door leading into a mural vault 18 feet by 12 feet, over that by which
    the first floor is entered. This vault has a loop to the east upon
    the great staircase, on the north the eight steps, already mentioned,
    and in the south wall a narrow door and mural passage leading to the
    robing-room and ante-chapel. In the north end of the great chamber,
    near the north-east corner, a door opens into a chamber 7 feet by 5
    feet, which lies in the north wall below the window recess, here of 8
    feet opening.</p>

  <p>The west chamber, 55 feet by 21 feet, has in its south end a window
    recess 7 feet broad, in the east wall of which a door opens into
    a mural chamber 14 feet by 9 feet, with a loop to the south and a
    fireplace in the east wall. In the west wall of the great chamber is a
    window recess 5 feet wide, commencing at the floor level, and there are
    three doors. That at the north end opens into a chamber, 22 feet by 9
    feet, in the west angle, with loops to the west and north. From this
    opens a passage in the north wall 17 feet long, which ends in a chamber
    11 feet by 5 feet; chambers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> and passage have loops to the north. Near
    the centre of the west wall of the great chamber a door opens into
    another mural chamber, 22 feet by 14 feet, with two loops to the west
    and a fireplace in the east wall. Another door leads, by a curved
    passage with a loop to the west, into the south-west staircase. In the
    great cross-wall is a door near its north end, and in each of its faces
    two large fireplaces, now walled up. In the north wall is a high window
    or recess of 8 feet opening.</p>

  <p>The main gallery, though it threads the wall nearly all round, lies
    at different levels, and at one point is stopped. It is entered from
    the two staircases. That at the north-east gives off two branches, of
    which one rises by fourteen steps, with a loop to the north, and enters
    a passage in the north wall 16 feet long, having a loop to the north,
    and to the south an opening, now blocked up, into the great chamber.
    The passage ends in a chamber 18 feet by 8 feet, in the north wall of
    which is a loop, and near it a deep recess for a garderobe; and in the
    south wall is what seems to be the mouth of a gallery threading the
    cross-wall, where, however, it would be stopped, or very much reduced,
    by the shafts of the fireplaces. The other branch from the north-east
    staircase rises by six steps, when it gives off a branch to the east
    of nine steps, which lead to the roof of the upper tower of the
    forebuilding. The main passage then curves and rises ten steps more,
    in all sixteen steps, when it enters the substance of the east wall,
    where it is 60 feet long and 4 feet 7 inches broad, and has a door to
    the east, opening on the middle tower of the forebuilding, and a loop,
    and opposite to these are two openings in the west wall, which formerly
    opened into the great chamber, and now are blocked by the brick vault.
    The passage then turns and lies for 67 feet in the south wall. In its
    east end is a loop; in its south wall, there 10 feet thick, a door
    opening upon the roof of the lower tower of the forebuilding. In the
    same wall are two, and probably three loops, opposite to two of which
    seem to have been openings into the great chamber. The third is much
    broken. In the inner wall is a recess, probably the mouth of the
    cross-wall gallery. At its west end the main gallery descends twenty
    steps to reach the south-east staircase. From this staircase, at twenty
    steps higher up, a door opens into the gallery, which is continued
    along the west wall 68 feet. It has three loops in the outer wall,
    opposite to two of which are apertures, now closed, which looked into
    the great chamber. This gallery is continued 15 feet, with a width of 6
    feet, in the north wall.</p>

  <p>The roof of the keep is now an artillery platform, pierced on the south
    by six and on the west by five embrasures, the top of the pilasters
    forming a bay in the centre of each face. The two other faces are
    solid, and protected by guns ‚Äúen barbette.‚Äù Of the four turrets, which
    are 21 feet square, with two entrances on each face, the two to the
    south have entrance stairs, and doors from the stair-head open in the
    side of those at the north-east and south-west angles. The north-west
    turret seems to be entered by an opening in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> its east face. Though
    these turrets have been much pulled about, their substance seems
    original.</p>

  <p>The forebuilding covers the whole of the east and about 45 feet of the
    adjacent south face of the keep. Its breadth ranges from 15 feet to
    23 feet. It was strengthened by three towers, one over the north end
    or top of the staircase, one over the south-east angle or bottom, and
    one on the east front over the middle of the staircase. The middle
    tower, in which was the middle doorway, is unusual. These rose to about
    four-fifths of the height of the main building, and their battlements
    were reached, as has been shown, by doors from the upper gallery.
    The object of this forebuilding was to contain and protect the great
    staircase, and in it are three vestibules, a lower and upper chapel,
    and an ante-chapel, several mural chambers, and a well. The entrance
    at this time begins from the ground on the south front by an open
    staircase of ten steps, probably modern, as the original ascent seems
    to have been against and parallel to the keep wall. At the top of these
    steps is a landing, upon which opens the present entrance into the
    basement floor. The staircase then turns to the right and rises eleven
    steps, still open, having on the left the keep and on the right the
    flanking projection of the forebuilding, in which is the lodge, and
    above it the robing-room. In front is a lofty doorway, 7 feet wide,
    with a segmental arch, quite plain, and above it a loop which opens
    from the chapel passage. This was the lower entrance, and was closed
    by a barred door. Entering the doorway, eleven steps under cover lead
    to the lower vestibule, which is thirty-two steps, or 20 feet, above
    the ground. This vestibule is a handsome chamber, 15 feet by 12 feet,
    with an arcade of two arches in its south wall, each pierced for a
    loop. In the west wall, near the entrance, is the door of the lodge, a
    plain barrel-vaulted chamber, 13 feet by 6 feet, having a loop to the
    west. In the east wall of the vestibule is an arch of 7 feet opening,
    springing from coupled columns and flanked by two others. The head
    is moulded with the chevron pattern. This arch opens into the lower
    chapel, 14 feet by 13 feet, which occupies the south-eastern angle of
    the building, and is so placed that the altar could be seen if desired
    by each person who entered the keep. In its north and south walls are
    arcades of two arches, divided by a pier carrying two nook shafts and
    a third shaft in the centre. In the south-east arch is a loop, and
    opposite to it a cupboard. In the east end is also a loop, placed in
    a recess flanked by two shafts. The floor of this chapel is one step
    above the vestibule. The ceiling of both was flat, and of timber.
    Beneath chapel and vestibule is the vault already described. The walls
    of this part of the forebuilding are from 2 feet 6 inches to 5 feet
    thick.</p>

  <p>From the vestibule a doorway, the second, opens in the north wall.
    This has a segmental head, and is original, but it has been reduced in
    breadth, probably when the basement door was opened, by the insertion
    of new jambs. It opens into a vaulted passage, 6 feet wide and 5 feet
    long, being the thickness of the north wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> of the lower tower. It is
    occupied by three steps and a landing, from which four steps ascend
    into the middle vestibule. This is a chamber 25 feet long by 15 feet
    broad, having a modern roof and two modern windows in its east wall,
    which has been in part rebuilt. On the left, on entering, is a Tudor
    doorway, and above it a square-headed window of two lights, of the same
    date. This opens into a mural chamber already described, and thence
    into the first floor of the keep. A large arch of relief is seen above
    in the wall, and it is probable that there was always a door here.</p>

  <p>Beyond this door the staircase rises by twelve steps to a broad landing
    at the end of the vestibule. Besides the Tudor doorway and window, on
    the same side, higher up, are loops from two mural chambers of the
    second floor of the keep, and in the south wall over the stairs a small
    door, not now used, which opens into the ante-chapel. In the north wall
    of this vestibule, a doorway of 5 feet opening, the third in order
    upon the stairs, opens into a passage 6 feet wide, which pierces the
    wall of the middle tower, here 6 feet thick, the whole tower being 14
    feet. From this doorway a flight of twenty steps, 8 feet wide, ascends
    into the upper vestibule, to a large landing 19 feet by 14 feet. The
    vestibule itself is 25 feet by 14 feet, and lies between the middle
    and upper tower of the forebuilding. In the east wall, which has been
    rebuilt with the roof, are two modern windows. In the south wall a
    narrow passage, 10 feet long by 3 feet broad, leads to the outer well,
    the ashlar pipe of which is 4 feet diameter. It seems to have been used
    in modern times as a cesspit, and is choked up. The well is placed in
    the centre of the tower, which seems to have been a mass of masonry. At
    present the wall round the well has been broken away so as to form a
    rude chamber. It cannot now be ascertained whether the well stopped at
    this level, as is probable, or was carried up to the roof of the tower.
    In the north end of the vestibule, looking down upon the staircase, a
    door leads into a vaulted guard-chamber, 16 feet by 10 feet, with loops
    to the north and east, and a deep recess in the west wall. In the west
    wall of the vestibule is the great door of the keep and a loop from the
    well-chamber. There are traces on this wall of ashlar, as though it was
    originally intended to vault and groin this vestibule.</p>

  <p>In the forebuilding, on the level of the second floor of the keep,
    remain to be mentioned the robing-room, ante-chapel, and chapel. They
    are placed in the lower tower of the forebuilding over the lodge,
    vestibule, and lower chapel, and were entered only from the keep,
    through the mural chamber already described. From this chamber a
    passage, only 2 feet 5 inches broad, lies in the wall over the outer
    doorway, and from it a loop opens over the staircase, outwards. This
    passage, 17 feet long, ends in two small doors, right and left, one
    entering the robing-room, the other the ante-chapel. Originally this
    was the only way into the chapel, and a very stout person could
    scarcely have reached it. The Plantagenet princes, though mostly big in
    the bones, were rarely corpulent. The robing-room is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> over the lodge.
    It is 10 feet by 7 feet, vaulted, groined, and ribbed; the ribs are
    of plain roll section, and there is no boss. They spring from nook
    shafts at the four angles. There are loops, or rather small windows,
    of a foot opening to the west and south, flanked by small columns. The
    ante-chapel, 16 feet by 13 feet, has an arcade of two arches in the
    north and south walls, and a loop in the north-east space, converted
    into a small door, so as to give a separate entrance. In the east
    wall an arch of 8 feet span opens into the chapel. It springs from
    coupled columns, flanked on each face by two others, and the arch has
    a chevron moulding. The floor was of timber, and rested on five beams.
    The roof is vaulted, groined, and ribbed, and the moulding a roll with
    a band of dog-tooth. The chapel is 14 feet by 13 feet. It is peculiar
    in its position, being placed over the base of the entrance stair,
    instead of, as at Middleham, at its head. It also has an arcade of two
    arches in the north and south walls, with nook shafts in pairs at the
    angles behind which, from a corbel capital, spring the ribs of the
    vaulted roof. These are of a roll section with a band of the dog-tooth
    ornament, and a central flowered boss. There is a small east window,
    and also south of it a piscina with a trefoiled head and projecting
    basin, now broken off. This seems a Decorated addition. There are two
    loops in the south wall, and one in the north near the east end, and in
    the other north bay a cupboard. The floor was of timber, resting upon
    four joists.</p>

  <p>The material of this keep is chiefly the rag stone of the country
    worked as rubble, not very regularly coursed. Ashlar, mostly of Caen
    stone, is used freely for the door and window dressings and the
    quoins. The joints are close. The pilasters are of unusual breadth and
    projection. The chapels and the lower vestibule are highly ornate,
    with much of the chevron and roll mouldings, and occasionally of the
    dog-tooth. The arches are sometimes segmental, but more commonly full
    centred. There is no portcullis in the building; the entrances were
    closed with doors only, secured with wooden bars. None of the loops
    that open on the staircase could be used in its defence. Excepting
    about the main door there is no ornamentation in the keep itself.
    Doors, windows, and fireplaces seem to have been quite plain. This
    is the only known keep in which there is a second well, and it is
    difficult to understand why there should be two so near together, the
    expense of making which must have been so great. The upper gallery is
    of very rude masonry indeed; the lines of the passages do not coincide
    with the general direction of the walls, and the execution is very
    inferior. It is unfortunate, with ample buildings all round, that
    the authorities should pervert this very curious keep to vulgar and
    dangerous uses. The stores should be kept elsewhere, and the brick
    vaulting and additions be removed. The external breaches and doors in
    the walls should be closed, the second well cleared out, and the whole
    building as far as possible restored to its original condition. It
    might then be fitted up as a museum of arms, and every part, including
    the ward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> made accessible. The reputed date of this keep is 1153,
    when the foundations are said to have been laid by Henry, grandson of
    Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, shortly before he succeeded to the throne. This coincides
    sufficiently well with the evidence of the building itself, which is
    late in the Norman style.</p>

  <p>The general view here added is taken from the north, and shows the
    constable‚Äôs gate and bridge, and in the foreground the towers and
    curtains of the outer ward on this side. Immediately behind them are
    seen the square towers and the curtain of the inner, or Norman ward,
    and within all rises the keep, applied to the east side of which are
    seen the three towers of the forebuilding.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="DUNSTER_CASTLE_SOMERSET">DUNSTER CASTLE, SOMERSET.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Castle of Dunster is of high antiquity, and for many centuries
    was a place of great military consideration in the western counties.
    It was the <em>caput</em> of an extensive Honour, and the chief seat of
    a line of very powerful barons. The hill upon which it stands is the
    north-eastern, or seaward extremity of a considerable ridge, from which
    it is cut off by a natural depression, and thus forms what is known in
    West-Saxon nomenclature as a tor. The tor covers above ten acres of
    ground, and is about 200 feet high, with a table top in area about a
    quarter of an acre. It stands upon the western edge of a deep and broad
    valley, which contains the park, and below the castle expands into a
    tract of meadow about a mile in breadth, skirting the sea from Minehead
    to below Carhampton. The park is traversed by a considerable stream,
    the Avill, one head of which springs from Croydon Hill, and the other,
    flowing past Wootton-Courtenay, rises about six miles distant under
    Dunkery Beacon. The home view, one of exceeding richness, is limited
    and sheltered on the south and west by the Brendon Hills and the high
    ground rising towards Exmoor. To the east it includes the vales of
    Cleeve and Williton, bounded by the Quantocks. Seaward on to the north
    the eye ranges over Bridgwater Bay to the headland of Brean Down and
    Worle, and commands the west or opposite coast from Penarth Point to
    Aberavan and Swansea.</p>

  <p>West, and at the foot of the castle hill, and under the immediate
    control and protection of the old fortress, is the town of Dunster, a
    small and compact cluster of old-fashioned houses, many with timber
    fronts, in the midst of which is the parish church, once connected
    with the priory, the foundation of one of the early Norman lords. The
    eastern or monastic part of the building now forms the private chapel
    of the Luttrells, and contains several of their tombs.</p>

  <p>The fancy cloths once known as ‚ÄúDunsters‚Äù have long ceased to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>be
    fabricated, and of the fulling mills the ruins have well-nigh perished.
    The haven at which these manufactures found shipping is also silted
    up, and the privileges conceded to the townspeople, being now shared
    by the community at large, are no longer commemorated, and are known
    only because the charters granting them have been preserved. Of the
    neighbouring hills, ‚ÄúGallocks‚Äù is thought to be so called because there
    the high judicial powers of the lords were exercised in the view of
    all men, and ‚ÄúGrabhurst,‚Äù the castle ridge, is said to be named from
    an entrenched wood, though this use of the word ‚Äúgraff‚Äù is unknown
    or unusual in English nomenclature, and ‚ÄúHirst‚Äù or ‚ÄúHurst‚Äù belongs
    rather to Sussex and Kent than to Somerset. The fact is that the hill
    in old deeds is spelt ‚ÄúGrobefast,‚Äù and is at this time colloquially
    ‚ÄúGrabbist.‚Äù Near it is a lofty detached hill known as ‚ÄúConygaer,‚Äù
    crowned by a tower of the last century. At present it is thickly
    planted, but no camp has been discovered there, such as the name might
    indicate. The castle mill remains. It is placed on the verge of the
    park, upon the stream, and concealed and protected by the castle.</p>

  <p>The castle is composed of two parts, due to the natural disposition
    of the ground; these are the tor or keep, and the lower ward. The tor
    is in form oval, and its summit, naturally flat, has been further
    levelled by art, as the slopes also have been trimmed, and rendered
    almost impracticable for direct ascent. The summit measures about 35
    yards east and west, by 70 yards north and south. The keep, which stood
    here, has disappeared, and its existence, long a matter of tradition,
    may now be deduced from a sewer and some foundations in the south-west
    corner laid open a few years ago. The present surface was laid down as
    a bowling-green in the last century, and a summer-house constructed at
    the north-east corner, in which is a window in the Perpendicular style
    taken from some earlier structure.</p>

  <p>The artificial scarping of the hill sides is confined to the upper 80
    or 100 feet. At this level are two platforms or shelves, one, a small
    one, towards the south, the other much larger, also chiefly natural,
    towards the north, and which forms the lower ward. The lower ward is
    of a semilunar or semioval figure, the hollow side being formed and
    occupied by a portion of the skirts of the tor. It measures about 33
    yards north and south by 126 yards east and west, and covers about half
    an acre of ground. The outer or convex edge, steep by nature, has been
    cut into a low cliff, supported by a retaining wall, which, with its
    flanking towers and superstructure of parapet, protected this ward.
    At the foot of this wall, part of which supports the present house,
    the slope recommences, and, though now terraced by roads and paths,
    formerly descended unbroken to the base of the hill.</p>

  <p>The keep was probably either circular or polygonal, approached as at
    Lincoln by a direct flight of steps from the lower ward. Its gateway
    seems to have been defended by a portcullis, as one is mentioned in
    the records, which could not have been in the earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> gateway or
    the later gatehouse. The buildings and inhabited part of the old
    castle were in the lower ward or its north-eastern quarter, upon the
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> or curtain wall, and on the site, generally, of the
    present house. The wall was strengthened and flanked by half-round
    towers, of which the lower part of several remain incorporated into the
    later building and connected with fragments of wall, now a part of the
    house, and betrayed by their excessive thickness. One of these walls
    has a core of the natural red sandstone rock, enclosed in masonry, but
    traceable by an occasional exudation of dampness. The gateway of this
    ward remains between two of these flanking towers. It is 9 feet broad,
    with plain chamfered jambs, and a low stiff drop arch. There was no
    portcullis, and probably no drawbridge, the only defence being a door
    composed of bars of oak, 4 inches square and 4 inches apart, forming
    a grating, planked vertically outside with inch-and-a-half oak plank.
    Upon each oak bar was laid a bar of iron, and the whole fabric was
    spiked together with iron fastenings, having diamond-shaped heads. The
    meeting line of the two valves was guarded by an iron bar. In the right
    valve, on entering, is a wicket-gate 3 feet 8 inches high by 2 feet 6
    inches broad, fastened with a huge iron lock in a wooden shell. This
    very curious specimen of carpenter‚Äôs and smith‚Äôs work, though of later
    date than the gateway, is old, not unlike that of Chepstow Castle, and
    probably of the time of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> or Elizabeth. The gateway itself
    belongs to those of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or his son. In the last century the
    gates were permanently closed, and behind them was built a wall backed
    with earth. The gateway has recently been restored as far as possible
    to its original condition, and now gives access by steps to the lower ward.</p>

  <p>The mural towers flanking the gateway are parts of circles, 16 feet
    6 inches external diameter, and the lower 12 feet are original. One
    contains a curious vaulted basement with the usual three loops, and in
    the rear a doorway which opened into the ward. The other, or eastern
    flanker, had a basement chamber until recently filled with earth, and
    had also three loops, of which two are still visible outside. This
    tower was connected with a building in its rear, the foundations of
    which are original, and now form a part of the offices. Also upon the
    retaining wall, but about 20 yards beyond, and to the south-west of
    the old gateway, is another similar flanking tower, of which the upper
    story remains, and a part of a doorway. This tower is open in the rear.
    The towers, curtain, and entrance gateway are, in substance, all of one
    date, and what ashlar remains is of good quality and well jointed. The
    superstructure has been renewed recently.</p>

  <p>The approach to the castle was steep, as it still is, from the
    town up to the old gateway, to enter which the road made a sharp
    turn. Just below the gateway, upon this approach, has been built a
    gatehouse, which projects from and is connected with the curtain,
    being incorporated into the tower, flanking the old curtain on the
    west side. This structure, the great gatehouse, still remains perfect,
    and, though evidently intended more for ornament than defence, makes
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> most appropriate approach to the castle, and gives to the whole
    structure much of a medi√¶val and something of a military character.
    This building is rectangular, 63 feet broad by 23 feet deep, and
    about 45 feet high, sixty-two steps leading to its battlements. It is
    pierced by a passage 10 feet 6 inches broad, having a plain pointed
    waggon vault, and at each end a not very highly pointed arch, with
    good moulded jambs continued round the head. There are no lodge doors
    opening into the archway, and neither portcullis nor drawbridge. The
    fronts are plain, save that the exterior has two flanking buttresses,
    and over the entrance is a rectangular panel containing nine coats of
    arms in three rows‚Äîone, four, and four. The interior front is flanked
    by two half-hexagonal turrets, of which that at the outer end contains
    a well-stair, entered from the outside by a small four-centred doorway,
    and communicating with each floor, and with the battlements. The
    corresponding turret is built upon one of the old mural towers which
    flanked the gateway of the lower ward. It contains a small chamber,
    probably a garderobe, on each floor. Against the outer end of the
    building are two buttresses, a large and small one, probably added
    to support the wall which then stood upon a steep slope and showed
    signs of settlement. The gatehouse is of three stages. The basement
    has a chamber on each side of the main passage, entered, one by the
    well-stair, the other by an exterior door. That next the well-stair is
    14 feet 6 inches by 9 feet 8 inches, and has a window to the front.
    That on the other side of the archway is 21 feet 6 inches by 16 feet 3
    inches, and is entered from the outside by a small doorway, probably an
    insertion. Opening from this chamber are two closets, and a well-stair
    ascends to the two floors above.</p>

  <p>The first floor contains two rooms, 22 feet 10 inches by 16 feet 6
    inches, and 21 feet 6 inches by 16 feet 6 inches, and 13 feet high. In
    its inner end are two closets.</p>

  <p>The second, upper, or principal floor, was formerly of two rooms, but
    has recently been converted into a handsome hall, 47 feet by 16 feet
    6 inches, with an open roof. It has five windows and a fireplace, and
    is entered on the level from the lower ward by a doorway, which seems
    an insertion of the date of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, and which has the head of the
    well-stair on one side, and beyond, on each side, a closet. The windows
    of the gatehouse are mostly of two lights, divided by a transom into
    four, with the upper lights cinquefoiled and in the head quatrefoiled.
    The summit is embattled, and at the four angles are turrets, of which
    the two to the outer or front face are apparent only.</p>

  <p>The shields on the exterior panel are, in the upper line, 1. Luttrell
    with crest and supporters. Below, in the next line, 2. Luttrell
    impaling Courtenay; 3. Luttrell impaling Beaumont of Sherwell; 4.
    Luttrell impaling Audley; 5. Luttrell impaling Courtenay of Powderham.
    In the lower row, 6. Luttrell impaling Hill; 7. Luttrell impaling
    blank; 8 and 9 blank. The Luttrell supporters were two swans chained
    and collared, derived from Bohun through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> Courtenay. The date of this
    gatehouse is uncertain. It has been thought to be the ‚Äú<span lang="la">novum √¶dificium
    castri de Dunster</span>,‚Äù with the construction of which the accounts show
    Henry Stone to have been charged in the 9th of Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>, but the lower
    part is of the style prevalent under Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> The door from the
    lower ward into the lobby is scarcely earlier than Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr> or <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr></p>

  <p>It is probable that the gatehouse was for some time used in combination
    with the gateway by its side, until the latter was closed. The approach
    and entrance, however inconvenient, were strong, and almost precluded
    any regular attacks by battering-machines, or even by escalade.</p>

  <p>The history of Dunster commences with Domesday, in which it is recorded
    that William de Mohun holds Torre, and there is his castle. Aluric held
    it in the time of King Edward. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Ipse [Willielmus de Moion] tenet Torre.
    Ibi est castellum ejus. Aluric tenuit T.R.E.</span>‚Äù These words are very
    appropriately inserted over the great chimney-piece in the hall. The
    Exeter Domesday also confirms the holding both of Mohun and Aluric. Who
    Aluric was is unknown. That he was a considerable Englishman none can
    doubt, but the name was common, occurring sixty-four times in Domesday,
    as does Alric, probably the same name, twenty-six times.</p>

  <p>Mohun no doubt found the tor strongly fortified, after the English
    manner, for not only was it a frontier fortress against the western
    Celts, but it must have been exposed to the piratical invasion of the
    Northmen, who gave name to the opposite islands of the Holms, and the
    not very distant port of Swansea. The place was, in fact, a natural
    burh on a large scale, such as √Üthelfl√¶d and Eadward the Elder were
    wont to throw up artificially on a smaller scale in the early part of
    the tenth century. There was the conical hill with its flat top for the
    <i lang="la">aula</i> or <i lang="la">domus defensabilis</i>, and the courtyard below for
    the huts and sheds of the dependents and cattle.</p>

  <p>William de Mohun was no mere adventurer. He was a great baron of
    the Cotentin, having the castle of Moion in la Manche. He fought at
    Hastings with a knightly following, and received from the Conqueror
    from sixty to seventy manors in Somerset, Devon, Dorset, and Wilts.
    These manors were in his time, or in that of his successor, combined
    into an Honour, as was the case with those attached to the chief seats
    of Plympton, Totnes, and Barnstaple. Dunster became the <i lang="la">caput
    honoris</i>.</p>

  <p>The Honour of Dunster was one of about eighty-six in England, though
    in what they differed from baronies is not precisely understood.
    The nucleus of either was almost always an estate held before the
    Conquest, added to largely by the Norman who conquered it. In all
    cases it extended into more than one county, and was held of the king
    <i lang="la">in capite</i> by homage, fealty, and military service. By the laws
    of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, every lord could summon his liegemen before the court,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">et si residens est ad remotius manerium ejusdem honoris unde tenet,
    ibit ad placitum, si dominus suus summoneat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> eum</span>.‚Äù The Honour is not a
    jurisdiction mentioned in Domesday, unless it be in a passage relating
    to Cornwall where it is recorded, ‚Äú<span lang="la">H√¶ terr√¶ pertinent ad honores
    chei</span>;‚Äù chei being a place. The term is said to have been first used
    by the Conqueror in his charter to the Abbot of Ramsey. Most of the
    Honours seem to have fallen into disuse by the alienation of the manors
    composing them, as was the case with Dunster, although the records show
    that for many centuries the rights were maintained by the lord of the
    castle in full rigour.</p>

  <p>To what extent the Mohuns were content with the earlier defences of
    the castle is unknown, but it is remarkable that no mouldings or
    fragments of Norman ornament have been dug up in or about the building,
    although there is original Norman work in the parish church. From the
    configuration of the ground the lines of the old fortress must have
    been where they still are, so that there would be no reason for pulling
    down the earlier works to enlarge the area; and yet it is difficult to
    suppose that works as durable as was the case with those of the Norman
    period could have fallen to decay by the reigns of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or Edward
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, the date of the oldest extant parts. However this may be, it is
    certain that the castle of the Mohuns was one of the most important of
    the western fortresses; and in the lawless days of Stephen it was held
    for the empress against the king, during the great revolt of 1138, its
    lord being then William de Mohun, the second baron.</p>

  <p>William, indeed, was not content with passive resistance. He is
    described as the ‚ÄúScourge of the West,‚Äù ravaging and plundering the
    country up to the gates of Barnstaple, where he was held in check by
    Henry de Tracy. He is said to have been created earl either of Dorset
    or Somerset, or both, by the empress in 1140; but this creation rests
    on very uncertain authority, and has never been admitted as valid. The
    earldoms of that period were very irregular, and some were afterwards
    set aside. This lord founded the Augustine Priory of Brewton, in
    Somerset, and, according to the Black Book of the Exchequer, he held
    forty-four knights‚Äô fees. It is not improbable that to him is due
    the circular or polygonal keep, which was common at that time where
    a castle possessed a mound, and which is known to have stood on the
    summit of the tor.</p>

  <p>No mention of the castle occurs till the reign of John, who held the
    castle and Honour during the minority of Lord Reginald, when the fines,
    <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, for the Honour were levied by the king‚Äôs officers. In the Chancery
    roll of 1201‚Äì2, Nicholas Puinz accounts for 15<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 2¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, half a year‚Äôs
    pay allowed to the janitor of the castle, and the same to the watchman;
    and these payments are repeated by Reginald de Clifton, who, in 1204,
    was ordered to place Reginald de Moyon in possession of the castle of
    Dunster and the heritage then in his custody. A very little before
    this, the coming of age of Reginald, Hubert de Burgh was in charge, and
    had accounted <span lang="la">‚Äúde finibus militum‚Äù</span> of the Honour; and 25th February,
    1202, John called upon the knights and free tenants to contribute
    through De Burgh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> for strengthening the castle. ‚ÄúOur castle,‚Äù the
    king calls it, probably not merely as holding it in wardship, but as
    asserting the general rights of the crown to all castles. A second
    Reginald seems to have founded a mass for the weal of his ancestors,
    to be said daily by a monk or a secular priest, to be provided by the
    prior, in the upper or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen‚Äôs chapel, in the castle, or during
    war in the chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, within the priory. If the same
    was neglected, power was reserved to distrain upon the goods of the
    prior. Leland mentions <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen‚Äôs chapel as connected with the keep.
    There seems also to have been a second chapel, as usual, in the lower
    ward. Upon the death of Lord Reginald, about 1213, the Honour again
    fell into the hands of the Crown during a long minority. Henry Fitz
    Count was placed in charge, and Alice the widow was allowed dower and
    ‚Äúmaritagium.‚Äù It is curious that John does not appear to have visited
    Dunster, although he was at Stoke-Courcy.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, in 1220, placed the forest of Dunster in charge of Peter
    de Maulay. He retained the castle in his own hands, and there occur
    several charges for the payment of Roger and William de Vilers, as
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">balistarii regis</span>,‚Äù who dwelt in the king‚Äôs castle of Dunster. A
    specific order in 1222 places the Mohun lands in Carhampton in charge
    of William Briwer, probably next of kin to the widow, but reserves to
    the king‚Äôs hands the castle and vill of Dunster. Soon after, Watchet
    market, being unlicensed and injurious to Dunster, was put down (Close
    Roll <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 137, 418, 605). The above were not the only persons to whom
    from time to time this valuable wardship was committed.</p>

  <p>Of the condition of the castle at the close of this wardship, nothing
    is on record; but the wealth of the family was much augmented by the
    match of Reginald, King John‚Äôs ward, with a Briwer co-heiress, and
    either his son Reginald, the founder, 1246, of Newenham Abbey, who
    died 41st Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1256, or his grandson John, who died 7th Edward
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1278, the last baron by tenure, might have built the curtain and
    mural towers containing the lower ward, of which the bases remain.
    The keep was probably left unaltered, and indeed, from the great and
    inconvenient height at which it stood, could have been but little used.
    The purely defensive parts of castles, when not inhabited by the owner,
    were usually but little cared for, and the allowance for a porter and a
    single watchman shows that in this respect Dunster was no exception.</p>

  <p>In 1376, John de Mohun, the eighth baron and the tenth in lineal
    descent from the founder of the family, died, leaving daughters only,
    and a sale of the castle and the rest of the property was effected by
    his widow Joan Burghersh. The purchaser was another widow, Elizabeth,
    daughter of Hugh Courtenay, Earl of Devon, and widow, first, of Sir
    John de Vere, and afterwards of Sir Andrew Luttrell, of Chilton, a
    cadet of the barons Luttrell of Irnham. Elizabeth was a lady of high
    rank, of kin, through the Bohuns, to Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and with the command
    of great wealth. Her son, Sir Hugh Luttrell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> became the new lord of
    the castle and Honour, and probably built the great gatehouse.</p>

  <p>The Luttrells were steady Lancastrians, and their representative, Sir
    James, took knighthood on the field of Wakefield, and fell in the
    second battle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban‚Äôs, when his estates were confiscated, 1st
    Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, though only to be restored, 1st Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>, in the person
    of his son, Sir Hugh. Sir Hugh Luttrell stood high in the favour of
    Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>, and seems to have lived at Dunster in great splendour. To
    a second Sir Hugh, Leland attributes the great gatehouse, and he may
    have completed or repaired it, and opened its south door leading upon
    the lower ward. Probably he also inserted the armorial panels over the
    entrance portal, the last of which, complete, bears his coat impaling
    that of Margaret Hill, his wife. He also repaired the chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Stephen. Leland describes the donjon, or keep, as having been ‚Äúfull
    of goodly buildings,‚Äù which, however, had disappeared even before
    his time. The inhabited part of the castle was then, as now, in the
    north-east angle of the lower ward. Sir Andrew, Sir Hugh‚Äôs son and
    successor, ‚Äúbuilt a new piece of the castle wall by the east.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The next possessor who left his mark upon the castle was George
    Luttrell, Sheriff of Somerset in 1593. He built the market-house in the
    town and the older part of the present dwelling-house, which bears date
    1589, incorporating with it much of the curtain wall, towers, and walls
    of the older and more distinctly military building. The entrance to the
    ward seems to have remained as before, through the gateway between the
    flanking towers.</p>

  <p>During the wars between Charles and the Parliament, the Luttrells
    sided warmly with neither party, and were out of favour with both. Its
    owners at this time were Thomas Luttrell, who died 1644, and George,
    died 1655. In 1643 a Royalist garrison, under Colonel Wyndham, took
    possession, and the castle was visited by Prince Charles, whose chamber
    is still pointed out. In 1646 Blake laid siege to the castle for the
    Parliament, and battered it from the north-west, behind the Luttrell
    Arms. It was surrendered by Wyndham in April, 1646. A few iron cannon
    balls, memorials of this siege, have been found.</p>

  <p>The government, although they apologised for the military occupation
    of the castle, levied a local rate for pulling it down. Probably this
    referred only to the upper part of the curtain wall on either side
    of the gatehouse. It is said that the gatehouse was injured, but its
    present condition shows that the injury could not have been of a very
    serious character.</p>

  <p>A century later the accounts show that the Luttrells raised the surface
    of the lower ward, probably about fourteen feet, evidently with earth
    obtained by scraping the adjacent slope of the tor. This, which
    involved the closing up of the old gateway, was probably combined with
    the construction of a new approach, which passed below and outside of
    the gatehouse, wound round the castle and the tor, and entered the
    lower ward at the new level. Matters thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> remained until the accession
    of Mr. George Luttrell in 1869, when, under the judicious advice of Mr.
    Salvin, a great addition was made to the Elizabethan house, a new tower
    was constructed on the west front, and the foundation and pavements of
    buildings along the north front, and connected with the entrance gate
    and the gatehouse were laid open, and the walls restored and rebuilt,
    and a terrace formed along a part of the curtain. The approach for
    carriages was also much improved, though, as before, at the cost of
    avoiding the great gatehouse.</p>

  <p>The ancient walls incorporated with the later residence prove that
    there must have been very considerable buildings upon the ground now
    occupied by it, but there is some reason to suppose that both hall and
    chapel stood near the site of the later gatehouse, and, therefore, to
    the right or west of the original entry. If this be so, the extent of
    buildings in the lower ward must have been very considerable indeed,
    as in the other direction they certainly extended, as does the present
    house, to the foot of the tor, and were flanked by it. Nevertheless,
    considerable as the alterations have been, and handsome and convenient
    as are the rooms of the present mansion, it represents very fairly
    the original fortress, and, like it, is sheltered by the tor, and
    predominates over the park, the town, and the sea-coast, commanding a
    very extensive view, and, as becomes the representative of so important
    a military post, is itself visible from the tract of country of which
    it was sometimes the terror, but more frequently the protection.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Castle of Durham is now given over to the use of the Northern
    University, and is in great part occupied by the students. Parts of it
    only are open to visitors, and any description of its details, under
    the present restrictions, would be of little value.</p>

  <p>In a recent volume of the publications of the Surtees Society, Mr.
    James Raine, the worthy son of a distinguished sire, has given to the
    arch√¶ological world a very curious poem, now first printed, entitled
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Dialogi Laurentii Dunelmensis Monachi ac Prioris</span>,‚Äù a work of the
    time, and which records the intrusion of William Cumin into the see of
    Durham. This was a period of extreme interest in that important see,
    once including the city of Carlisle and the territory of Teviotdale,
    and at the date of the poem still holding the Castles of Durham
    and Norham, fortresses of the first rank, even in a district which
    contained Bamborough.</p>

  <p>The strife between Stephen and Maud, severe all over England, was
    nowhere conducted with greater severity than upon the Tyne, the Tees,
    and the Wear. David of Scotland, Maud‚Äôs uncle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> active supporter,
    unsubdued by his defeat at Northallerton, claimed the earldom of
    Cumberland in his own right, and that of Northumberland in right of his
    wife. Durham alone stood in his path, and its bishop, Geoffrey Rufus,
    strong in his impregnable castle, steadfastly adhered to Stephen.
    His death in 1140‚Äì41 enabled a certain William Cumin, an adherent of
    David, to obtain by force and fraud possession of the castle and the
    temporalities of the see, although he failed to secure his election
    to the bishopric. The result was a severe contest between Cumin and
    the lawful bishop, William de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Barbe, in the course of which the
    cathedral was occupied by soldiery, and its monks were ill-treated and
    slain. It was not till 1144 that Cumin was put down, and peace restored
    to the house and patrimony of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert.</p>

  <p>Laurence, who was born at Waltham and brought up in its holy house,
    came to Durham during the episcopate of Flambard, who probably
    completed the castle, the masonry of which, at least, was begun during
    the reign of the Conqueror. As an ordinary monk, he was celebrated for
    his facility in metrical composition. He became first precentor, and
    then a chaplain, to the bishop. The episcopal seat and church of Durham
    has been described as</p>

  <div class="center small">‚ÄúHalf church of God, half fortress ‚Äôgainst the Scot,‚Äù</div>

  <p class="noindent">and the bishops themselves partook largely of this double character. In
    the bishop‚Äôs household, Laurence saw much of secular life. He became a
    hunter of the wolf and boar, a fisherman, and a judge of horse-flesh;
    and, if not actually a warrior, he certainly understood the principles
    of military defences. At the death of Bishop Rufus his connexion with
    the episcopal household ended, and he took an active part against the
    intrusion of Cumin and in the election of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Barbe. He was for some
    time expelled from the monastery; but after his return became prior
    in 1149. On <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Barbe‚Äôs death, in 1152, he led in the election of De
    Puiset, Stephen‚Äôs nephew, and supported him against the Archbishop of
    York, by whom he was excommunicated and sentenced to a penitential
    flagellation at the door of Beverley. Nevertheless, he stood firm to
    the election, and was one of those who accompanied De Puiset to Rome,
    and witnessed his consecration by the Pope. He did not, however, live
    to return to England, but died in France; and his bones only were laid
    at Durham.</p>

  <p>The Dialogues are but one of several of his poems. They may be referred
    to the first half of the twelfth century, when their author was
    probably resident within the castle with Bishop Rufus, and must have
    been very familiar with that nearly completed structure.</p>

  <p>The castle still retains many of the features and some of the buildings
    described in the poem. The ditch which cut off the fortress from the
    cathedral is, it is true, filled up, and the pasture ward to the east
    is built over and obscured, but the south gate, though rebuilt, stands
    on the old site, and is still the main entrance; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> the wall on the
    right on entering still extends towards the keep. The keep itself is a
    late work; but the mound upon which it stands is a part of the original
    fortress, and the masonry is laid on the old lines, and in outline
    the tower no doubt represents pretty clearly the work of Flambard. A
    strong wall still connects the keep with the lodgings of the castle,
    and forms the front towards the river. The chapel also remains but
    little altered, and the walls and arches of the dormitory are original.
    The well is still seen in the open court, and is, or was recently, in
    use. Notwithstanding various repairs, rebuildings, and additions, there
    can be but little doubt that the Castle of Durham resembles in its
    general aspect the fortress of the Conqueror and of Flambard; nor is
    there in England any more remarkable example of a Norman castle of the
    shell-keep type. The publication of the description of it by Laurence
    possesses, therefore, a peculiar charm; and this must be the excuse for
    the following attempt at its translation. The poem is here and there
    very obscure, and occasionally scratches Priscian‚Äôs head; and it may be
    that I have misapprehended one or two lines in the original:‚Äî</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="EATON_SOCON_CASTLE_BEDFORDSHIRE">EATON-SOCON CASTLE, BEDFORDSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Ouse, rising in the shires of Northampton and Bucks, and finally
    falling at King‚Äôs Lynn into the head of the Wash, flows deep and
    sluggish past Bedford, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neots, and Huntingdon, intersecting broad
    tracts of low and level land, now fertile meadow, but formerly almost
    impassable swamp, opposing great difficulties to the march of an
    invading force, especially if advancing from the eastern coast. At
    Eaton-Socon, between Bedford and Huntingdon, and a little above the
    town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neots, the Ouse impinges upon the rising ground to the
    west, upon which stand Eaton Church and Village, and which afforded
    facilities for the construction of a large and lofty earthwork.</p>

  <p>This earthwork, known as the Castle Hill, is placed upon the west or
    left bank of the river, about 30 yards from its present brink, and a
    furlong or so from the fine parish church. It is possible that when the
    earthwork was first formed, the course of the stream lay at the foot of
    the banks. At present there is a large mill upon the river, a few yards
    above the castle, the leat of which is reunited to its parent stream
    opposite to the south-eastern edge of the fortress.</p>

  <p>The appended sketch shows the general plan of the place. It is, roughly
    speaking, a triangle, the east side, of 160 yards, resting upon the
    river, and the north side, of 140 yards, projecting from it at a
    right angle. The third side, or hypothenuse, is convex and irregular;
    measured upon the curve, it is in length about 220 yards. The area,
    complete, is about 3¬Ω acres.</p>

  <p>The work is composed of three parts‚Äîan Inner, Northern, and Outer ward.
    The inner and north wards lie side by side upon the river, separated
    by a cross ditch. The two are contained within another ditch, which
    communicated at each end with the river. Beyond this, covering the
    south-western front, is the outer ward, and beyond this again the outer
    ditch, which commences at the south-east corner in the mill leat,
    covers the south-western front, and at the north-western angle sweeps
    round to join the ditch already mentioned, and thus, through it, to
    communicate with the river at the north-east corner of the work.</p>

  <p>The <em>Inner Ward</em> is about 45 yards north and south, or along the
    river front, by 54 yards east and west. Its figure is a rectangle, with
    the angles so rounded off that its aspect is almost as much that of a
    circle as of a square. Towards the river is a steep slope of about 20
    feet. On the other sides a similar slope falls towards the ditch. On
    the crest of the slope on these three inland sides is a bank of earth
    about 8 feet to 12 feet high, especially strong at the north-west
    corner. The entrance was at the south-east corner. The inner area or
    platform of the ward is about 15 feet above the level of the exterior
    soil. On this platform, about 8 yards from the north-east <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>corner, is
    a low circular mound about 5 feet high and 40 feet diameter upon its
    table-top. It may have been somewhat higher. It has no ditch of its
    own. The ditch of this ward is from 40 feet to 50 feet broad, and still
    contains water.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_036">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">EATON SOCON, BEDS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>North of this is the <em>North Ward</em>, above 35 yards north and south,
    by 80 yards east and west. This also has a ditch about 40 feet broad,
    on the west and north fronts. From the inner ward it is separated by
    the cross ditch common to the two, and towards the river is a steep
    slope about 20 feet high. Besides these defences, the slope on the west
    and north is crested by a steep bank of earth, and towards the south,
    or inner ward, is one somewhat slighter.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em> is in figure long and curved. Its breadth
    ranges from 29 yards at the north end down to 22 yards near the
    south-east end, beyond which it terminates upon the mill leat in a
    point. This ward is separated from the other two by a common ditch,
    which communicates with the cross ditch, and thus at three points,
    directly or indirectly, with the river. The south-eastern end opens
    at the junction of the leat with the river. The leat covers this end
    of the ward, and from the leat springs the outer ditch, from 40 feet
    to 50 feet broad, which covers the outer front of the ward, and at
    its northern end, sweeping round by a sharp angle, is continued till
    it joins the north ditch, of which it thus forms a part. The entrance
    was at the south-east corner, where a modern causeway crosses this
    outer ditch. The road thence skirts the edge of the outer ward, along
    the margin of the leat, and thence, by a second causeway, crosses the
    inner ditch, and, ascending the slope, gains the inner ward. No doubt
    these causeways represent drawbridges. It does not appear how the inner
    and north wards communicated. The bridge between the latter and the
    outer ward was probably at the south-west corner of the northern. The
    ditches are in parts reduced in depth, and evidently were originally
    fed from the river. There is not a trace of masonry, but depressions in
    the bank of the north ward seem to indicate towers at its north-east
    and north-west angles. It is convenient to use the term angle, but the
    lines are more or less curved and irregular, and are largely rounded
    where they meet. The plan has, in fact, nothing of the squareness of a
    Roman work, and the rounding of the angles is quite different. It is
    probable that the tendency to sharpness in its outline is due to the
    walls and towers of the work in masonry, which, though now gone, is
    reported to have been at one time present.</p>

  <p>Eaton, or Eiton, appears in Domesday as held <i lang="la">in capite</i> by the
    Bishop of Bayeux, but there is no mention of a castle either then or at
    any later time. The Beauchamps, its later lords, do not there appear
    as Bedfordshire landowners. In the ‚ÄúLiber Niger,‚Äù however, about 1165,
    Simon de Beauchamp held a barony, under which Hugh de Beauchamp held
    one knight‚Äôs fee.</p>

  <p>This Hugh was of Eaton. He was the eldest son of Oliver, a cadet of
    Milo de Beauchamp, of Bedford. Oliver and Hugh were founders of Bismead
    Priory, in Eaton parish. Hugh was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> considerable baron. He was Custos
    of Rhuddlan Castle 3 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and, 22 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, one of those who
    conveyed Henry‚Äôs daughter to Palermo, on her marriage with the King
    of Sicily. He was slain in Palestine, 33 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and succeeded by
    Roger, his brother, and he by a third brother, William, whose son John
    inherited, and, 6 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, was seized of the family manors of Eaton
    and Sandy. His son was William, living 42 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, father of Ralph,
    summoned as Lord Beauchamp of Eaton, and who died 21 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, holding
    one fee in Sandy and Eaton, no doubt that held by Hugh, his ancestor.
    He held Eaton <i lang="la">in capite</i>, ‚Äú<span lang="la">per baroniam</span>.‚Äù His son, Roger de
    Beauchamp, of Eaton, was the last summoned. He was aged 21 at his
    father‚Äôs death, and his descendants have not been followed up.</p>

  <p>44 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, John de Goldington and Jocosa his wife, John
    Hemmyngford and others, were seized of a third part of Eaton juxta <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Neots, and half of Sandy. 1 Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, Sandy was held by Katherine,
    wife of Sir Thomas Engayne; and 1 Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, Lord Zouch had Eaton.
    Long after the extinction of the barons, the barony remained, and
    Wyboldeston Manor was held of it by Sir John de Greystock. In the
    reigns of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> and Elizabeth, Eaton was held by the Lords
    Vaux of Harrowden, who sold it in 1624. They were cadets of Vaux of
    Gillsland, and are said to have inherited Eaton from the Beauchamps.</p>

  <p>Although the manor of Eaton is not unfrequently mentioned in the
    records, we never hear of the Castle, nor is the addition of ‚ÄúSocon‚Äù
    ever used. Leland writes of ‚ÄúEiton a good village in interiore ripa‚Äù
    [of the Ouse] ... ‚Äúwhere be seen vestigia castelli between the church
    and the ripe, and almost hard on the ripe.... The ruins of Eiton
    Castle long to Lord Vaux.‚Äù In Leland‚Äôs loose language these terms may
    apply to the earthworks only. It is, however, probable, from present
    appearances, and from the place having for six descents been the
    chief, if not the only seat, of barons of the realm, that there was a
    castle, and Speed, writing a little later, names Woodhill, Tempsford,
    Eaton, and Ampthill, as the castles of Bedfordshire. It is possible
    that a very moderate excavation would lay bare the foundations, though
    no doubt, building materials being scarce in these parts, those who
    dismantled the castle would make a clean sweep of the masonry.</p>

  <p>The position is a very strong one, and the earthworks much resemble
    those of Huntingdon, and are probably of the same age. The mill is
    no doubt a very old one, though this does not apply to the present
    structure.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CASTLE_OF_EWIAS_HAROLD_HEREFORDSHIRE">THE CASTLE OF EWIAS HAROLD, HEREFORDSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE ‚Äú<span lang="la">Castellaria Aluredi Ewias</span>‚Äù of Domesday was a tract, the
    particulars of which are not known, but which no doubt lay among those
    lines of hill and valley which converge like the fingers of a hand
    upon the Worm and the Monnow, between the Golden Valley and the Black
    Mountain, and form the south-western portion of the county of Hereford.
    The actual castle, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Castellum Ewias</span>,‚Äù stands about six miles within
    the border, and about three miles outside or west of the presumed line
    of Offa‚Äôs Dyke at this point. The country is hilly, but fertile, well
    worth the defence, for which it affords many natural advantages. The
    immediate position is chosen with great skill, though it required an
    immense application of human labour to make it an almost impregnable
    fortress against the fierce and active hordes of Welshmen whose
    alienated patrimony it was intended to grasp. While the Mound of Builth
    remains an evidence of English rule, that of Ewias can scarcely be
    regarded as the advanced post, the ‚ÄúCastle Dangerous‚Äù upon the British
    territory; but it must nevertheless at all times have been a post of
    very great danger, and have borne, with Kilpeck, the brunt of the
    ordinary and frequent attacks of the men of South and West Wales upon
    Hereford.</p>

  <p>In selecting the position advantage was taken of a tongue of high land,
    broad towards the west and north, but which came rapidly to a narrow
    and almost abrupt termination in a point about 300 feet above and
    within the junction of the two adjacent streams. Of these the larger
    flows along the northern front of the position, and the smaller down a
    deep valley along its southern front. The two meet a few score yards
    below the high ground; and upon the left or further bank of the larger
    stream, and a short distance above the junction, is the church, and
    attached to it the village, to which the castle and its English lord
    have given the distinguishing name.</p>

  <p>It was decided to convert the point or eastern end of the high ground
    into the proposed strong place, and to form thus, in the northern
    fashion, an isolated mound. With this intent a broad and deep ditch was
    cut across the ridge, curved so as to embrace about one-half of the
    future elevation. At its north end the ditch was carried straight down
    the hill-side towards the brook. At its south end it came to rather
    a sharp conclusion, running out upon a natural bank and slope. Here,
    however, it was in some sort resumed at a lower level, and ended in a
    shallow ditch at the southern or principal entrance to the castle. The
    part thus isolated by the ditch formed the circular base of a mound
    of about 120 yards diameter and about 30 feet high. This the addition
    of the soil from the ditch raised to about 70 feet, and thus gave
    it, in the military sense, a command over the adjacent part of the
    original ridge. On its opposite, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> eastern side, the mound does not
    descend at once towards the junction of the waters, but at its foot is
    a broad semicircular platform, which covers its east, north-east, and
    south-east fronts, and from the outer or convex edge of which descends
    a steep slope towards the water, which slope is again succeeded by
    inclinations of a far more gentle character, not included in the
    military works.</p>

  <p>A fair general idea of this stronghold may be given by supposing a
    circular platform of 200 yards diameter to be bordered on the east and
    adjacent sides by a steep natural slope falling from its edge, and on
    the west and adjacent sides by a steep artificial slope falling to
    its edge. Then on the western margin is placed a conical table mound,
    60 feet or 70 feet high, and about 120 yards diameter at the base,
    which necessarily converts the western slope into the further side
    or counterscarp of a ditch, and reduces the eastern side to an open
    crescent-shaped platform. Such is the original plan of the Castle of
    Ewias, and such its present appearance after the complete removal
    of the masonry which for about 600 years adorned or encumbered its
    earthworks.</p>

  <p>The top of the mound is oval, about 34 yards north and south by 40
    yards east and west. Upon it has stood a shell-keep, either circular or
    many-sided, about 30 yards diameter. Although no masonry remains, the
    outline of the keep is plainly indicated by the trench which has been
    dug while the foundations were being grubbed up. The keep seems from
    this to have stood, not in the centre, but nearer the eastern margin
    of the mound, probably to allow room for a couple of exterior towers,
    or perhaps a gatehouse, which seems to have stood where now are some
    circular pits. Towers would be well placed on this the weakest side,
    so as to give a still greater command over the approach along the high
    ground. There is no trace of any regular ascent to the keep,‚Äîno mark of
    an original winding path up the mound, that now in use being evidently
    very modern. The side is so steep that no wheeled carriage could ascend
    it, and scarcely any heavily-laden horse. Probably the way up lay by a
    direct flight of steps, as at Hawarden and Carisbrook.</p>

  <p>There is no trace of a well. The material of the keep was evidently a
    hard schistose bed of the old red sandstone, fragments of which are
    seen in the excavations.</p>

  <p>The outer ward or crescent-shaped platform, below and west of the
    keep, runs out to a point towards the southern end, but to the north
    or north-west it is stopped at a breadth of about 42 yards by the
    prolongation of the keep ditch. The breadth of the ward at its greatest
    is about 60 yards. Along the north-west front it is strengthened by
    large earth-banks thrown up from the contiguous ditch, but elsewhere
    the natural slope of from 30 feet to 40 feet, steeply scarped, needed
    neither ditch nor bank. This ward had a curtain wall along its outer
    edge, of which the foundation diggings remain open. The north-west end
    was continued up the mound, and probably the circuit on the opposite
    side was completed in a similar way, so as to make the mound and keep,
    as at Tamworth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> and Durham, a part of the general <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. A
    group of excavations shows that this ward contained a considerable
    number of domestic buildings placed in its north-eastern and eastern
    part, near to the curtain wall. At the foot of the mound to the north
    is a sort of notch in the line of bank, possibly indicating a postern.
    The main approach evidently rose gradually from the village bridge, and
    skirted the foot of the eastern slope of the outer ward nearly to its
    south end, where it turned inwards and entered that ward by a roadway
    or slight cutting.</p>

  <p>There is no trace of masonry to be seen within or about the castle
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>; the material seems to have been in request as
    building-stone, and to have been everywhere collected and even grubbed
    up with most covetous care. There is a limekiln on the south side,
    near the line of the entrance, no doubt built of the materials of the
    castle, and a sort of house, now a shed, between it and the brook, but
    the material shows no mark of the tool and no old mortar.</p>

  <p>There are some mounds between the castle and the brooks, possibly
    thrown up on the occasion of some attack by the enemy. On the other or
    high side there are no outworks nor any indications either of attack or
    defence.</p>

  <p>There are no remains of the priory save what are included within the
    parish church. This is a good-sized building, recently repaired or
    restored, and in excellent order. It is composed of a tower, nave,
    south porch, and chancel. The nave has been so completely restored
    that little of old work is to be seen in its walls or roof. It is
    probably in substance of Decorated date, judging from the buttresses
    on the south side. The porch is new. The chancel has in the north
    wall a sepulchral recess, of Decorated pattern, covering the original
    recumbent figure of a female with her hands in prayer, holding what
    looks like a covered cup. In the south wall are two lancet windows of
    one light, under pointed recesses, and between them a late Decorated
    window of two lights, trefoiled, with a plain four-sided opening in the
    head. The whole is in a round-headed recess. The arch into the nave is
    new.</p>

  <p>The tower is the best part of the church. It is of large size, square,
    and short for its size, probably having had another story. It rests
    upon a bold plinth, about 5 feet 6 inches high, at the top of which is
    a bold half-round cordon, with a band. The south-west angle is covered
    by the pilaster buttresses, of 8 feet 6 inches breadth, and a foot
    projection, which die into the tower, near the present summit. In this
    angle is a well-stair. In the south side is an unusually large door, of
    8 feet opening, with high lancet arch. In the centre of the flat jamb
    on each side is a half-column, 2 feet diameter, with a water-bearing
    moulding, and a sort of bell-cap, with several bands of moulding above
    it. The arch is plainly chamfered, and the cordon of the tower is
    carried round it as a hood. Above this is a clumsy window of two lancet
    lights under a pointed head, very plain. Above this again is a small
    broad window, with a trefoiled head, and above all an early English
    window of three lights, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> three-quarter shafts before each mullion,
    with bell-caps. In the nooks of each jamb are two similar shafts, seven
    in all. The head is a drop-pointed arch, plainly chamfered. There is a
    window similar to this in the north wall. The church contains nothing
    earlier than this mixture of the early English with the Decorated
    style. The masonry of the castle was probably, from its plan, of a
    late Norman, or transitional date. The earthworks are of the regular
    Herefordshire type; attributable to the English of the early part
    of the tenth century. They resemble generally, in the presence of a
    mound, those of Kilpeck and Builth, Caerleon and Cardiff, of Brecon,
    Abergavenny, and many places in this county or district. No doubt this
    and the similar works were thrown up when the early Saxon inroads were
    made into Wales, and were the strongholds of the invading chiefs.</p>

  <p>Ewias Harold certainly does not bear the name of its founder, and that
    founder was probably as completely forgotten in the eleventh century as now.</p>

  <p>There are two places called Ewias in Herefordshire, distinguished by
    the names of their eleventh-century owners, as Ewias Lacy and Ewias
    Harold. Both are mentioned in Domesday, and both as the seats of a
    castelry, a sort of Honour or superior lordship attached to the castle.
    Under the lands of the church of Hereford, we are told that ‚Äúin the
    manors of Dodelegie and Stane are ten hydes, all waste save one in
    Dodelegie. Of the nine, one part is ‚Äòin castellaria Aluredi Ewias,‚Äô and
    the other in the King‚Äôs enclosed land.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Another entry explains that Alured was Alured de Merleberge or of
    Marleborough, a great tenant in chief, especially in Wiltshire. We
    read, ‚ÄúAlured de M. holds the castle of Ewias of William the King. For
    that king conceded to him the lands which William the Earl [Fitzosbern
    of Hereford] had given to him. Who refortified [<i lang="la">refirmaverit</i>]
    this castle.‚Äù Of it held seven knights, whose Christian names are
    given, besides other persons. The castle was then valued at ¬£10. Agnes,
    the daughter of Alured, married Turstan of Wigmore.</p>

  <p>How or when Alured gave up the castle does not appear; but in 1100 it
    was held by a certain Harold, also a large tenant in Domesday, though
    not in Herefordshire. He is called ‚Äú<span lang="la">Heraldus filius comitis Radulphi</span>,‚Äù
    and as such held Sudeley, in Gloucestershire. Earl Ralph, called the
    Timid, was the Earl of Hereford who was beaten by the Welsh and English
    forces in 1055, when his son was a mere child. Ralph was a considerable
    man by descent, being great-grandson of √Üthelred and great-nephew
    to the Confessor. Harold probably obtained some of his father‚Äôs
    possessions when he came of age, and Ewias may have been part of them.
    He and his descendants were liberal donors to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter‚Äôs, Gloucester,
    in its behalf founding the Priory near the Castle of Ewias.</p>

  <p>The names and order of Harold‚Äôs sons are preserved in the Gloucester
    Cartulary, and they correct Dugdale and all other authorities. They
    were Robert, Roger, John (to whom his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> gave Sudeley, and
    whose issue were barons), Alexander, and William. Robert de Ewias,
    the eldest, is described in the ‚ÄúGesta Stephani‚Äù as ‚Äú<span lang="la">vir stemmatis
    ingenuissimi</span>.‚Äù According to the ‚ÄúLiber Niger,‚Äù he held <i lang="la">in capite</i>
    upwards of forty-seven fees, the mesne tenants of which were twenty
    knights. Dugdale mentions only twenty-two fees, and confounds him with
    a second Robert, his son, also Lord of Ewias. The elder Robert had by
    his wife Sybilla, Robert, and Richard de Ewias, who left a daughter and
    heiress, Sybilla, who married Philip Spenser, and left issue.</p>

  <p>Robert de Ewias, the third owner of the castle, and the second baron,
    married Petronilla. He was living 1194‚Äì6. He also left a Sybilla,
    daughter and heiress of Ewias. She married, first, Robert de Tregoz;
    second, William de Newmarch, whom she married during her father‚Äôs
    lifetime, in the reign of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> He was living 11 John. Third,
    Roger de Clifford, probably the second brother of William de Clifford.
    From this match spring the Earls of Cumberland. Newmarch had no
    children. Sybilla was dead 20 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and was followed by her son,
    Robert de Tregoz, slain at Evesham 1265. He was father of John and
    Henry, father of a line of barons who ended about 1405.</p>

  <p>John de Tregoz died 1300, leaving two co-heirs, Clarice and Sybil.
    Clarice, who died 29 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, married Roger la Warre, and had John,
    aged 23, in 1300; and Sybil married Sir William de Grandison, ancestor
    in the female line of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Johns, Viscounts Grandison. In the
    partition, John la Warre had the ‚Äúbody of the castle,‚Äù of which, 4
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, he enfeoffed John de Cleydon. He died 21 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> John,
    his eldest son, died before him, and as early as 12 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> he had
    enfeoffed his grandson, Roger la Warre, and Elizabeth his wife, with
    Ewias Castle and Manor.</p>

  <p>Roger la Warre died 44 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, seized of Ewias Harold, and was
    succeeded by John, his son. 13 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Sir John de Montacute,
    sen., is seized of Ewias Harold, and three Wiltshire fees in the Honour
    of Ewias, and Teffont-Ewias, in Wiltshire, besides other Ewias lands in
    Herefordshire. 18 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, these same lands were held by Margaret,
    wife of Sir John Montacute, Bart.; and 10 Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, by Thomas de
    Montacute, Earl of Salisbury.</p>

  <p>The nature of this alienation is obscure; for, in the midst of it, 22
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Sir John de la Warre and Elizabeth his wife are seized
    of the Castle of Ewias Harold. However, there seems to have been
    an actual and permanent alienation to the Montacutes; for, 7 Henry
    <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, Thomas, Earl of Salisbury, has Ewias Harold. Thence it passed
    to the Beauchamps, of whom Joan, widow of Sir William Beauchamp, of
    Bergavenny, had the castle, vill, and lordship in 14 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>; and,
    finally, the Beauchamp heir, Edward Nevile, Lord Abergavenny, died
    seized of the castle, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, in Herefordshire, and of Teffont-Ewias, in
    Wiltshire.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CASTLE_OF_EXETER">THE CASTLE OF EXETER.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Castle of Exeter is not only a fortress of high antiquity, but is
    in many respects peculiar. It occupies the northern angle of the city,
    forming a part of its <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, and it crowns the summit of a
    natural knoll formed by an upburst of Plutonic rock, of a red colour,
    whence it derived its Norman appellation of Rougemont. The knoll rises
    steeply on the north-east and north-west from a deep valley, but on the
    other two sides the slope, though still considerable, is more gradual.
    The sides of the knoll have been scarped, and at the foot of its upper
    part a deep and broad ditch has been excavated, beyond which, to the
    north, a second scarp descends to the bottom of the valley. Towards the
    south, where the ground allowed of and required it, there was a second
    and outer ditch. The contents of the inner ditch were carried upwards
    and inwards to form a high bank round the original summit of the knoll,
    the central part of which was thus converted into a pit, and became the
    inner, and indeed the only, ward of the castle. In figure this ward,
    taken at the level of the circumscribing bank, is something between a
    square and a circle. Probably its outline was governed by the natural
    figure of the ground, and such angles as it now has are due to later
    modifications of the works.</p>

  <p>Originally then, the fortress was a hill camp, composed of a bank about
    30 feet high, cresting the edge of the knoll, and outside scarped down
    about 60 to 80 feet deep to the bottom of a broad ditch, which again
    was reinforced on the less steep side by a second ditch. The main ditch
    towards the north-east and north-west has been filled up and converted
    into a broad public walk and garden, but the outer or second scarp
    still remains, and descends to the valley now occupied by the station
    of the London and South-Western Railway. Towards the south-east and
    south the ditch remains unaltered, and is a very fine example of an
    ancient earthwork. Towards the east it seems to have been filled up.</p>

  <p>The camp thus described is probably older than the city, and was an
    ordinary earthwork, constructed in the usual fashion of the Britons,
    with one main ditch, reinforced with parts of others where needed. The
    main entrance was probably always on the south-eastern face, where the
    ground is less steep than elsewhere. Here, no doubt, a cut traversed
    the bank, and the ditches were crossed by narrow causeways, as at Old
    Sarum and elsewhere. These original works were probably British, and
    were no doubt occupied and slightly modified by the Romans. When the
    city, if such there was, of Caerwisc, was founded by the Britons, they
    probably made it an appendage to the south side of the camp, on the
    site of the present city, the spot being indicated by nature for such
    a purpose. The city occupies an oblong, elevated platform, contained
    between the Exe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> on the south-west, and its tributary streams, with
    their valleys, on the north-west and south-east, and connected with the
    higher and distant ground to the north-east by a long narrow isthmus,
    pierced recently by the tunnel of the London and South-Western Railway.</p>

  <p>The Isca Damnoniorum of the Romans was certainly this enclosure,
    though, no doubt, they gave their <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> more of a rectangular
    figure than it afterwards maintained, and laid out the cruciform
    roads which are occupied by the two main streets of the present city.
    The camp was their citadel, and they would, of course, continue the
    defences of the city up its faces, so as to make it a part of the
    general <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. The Saxons, on their arrival, no doubt
    contented themselves with these previous arrangements, and made the
    best of them against the Danes in 876 and 894. Rather later √Üthelstan
    walled in the city and the castle, and, amidst the varieties of ancient
    masonry still to be traced round the town, Mr. Freeman thinks it just
    possible that some of this great king‚Äôs work may be seen. These were
    the walls which enabled the citizens to hold at bay Swend of Denmark
    in 1001, when he threw up the earthworks at Penhow to the north of the
    city, and won a victory in the open field. When the Norman Conqueror
    appeared before Exeter in 1068, he approached from the north-east, and
    summoned the city at the east gate, just below the castle. √Üthelstan‚Äôs
    walls were then in good order, and it was in them that the breach was
    effected. Probably, however, neither the city walls nor the defences of
    the castle were up to the Norman standard, for Baldwin of Okehampton
    was left in command with the usual instructions to build a castle, as
    the Normans understood that formidable structure. How long Baldwin
    contented himself with repairing the existing defences, and in what
    order he replaced them, is unknown, but enough Norman work remains
    to show the general plan upon which he or his immediate successor
    proceeded. A strong retaining wall was built against the face of the
    upper bank. This wall rested, and does still rest, upon the natural
    edge of the hill, and it supports, as a revetment, the made ground
    behind it, being about 30 feet high, and having carried a parapet of
    about 4 feet more. Probably this wall was carried on slowly, the old
    outer defences being tenable.</p>

  <p>The earliest masonry now seen, earlier probably than the wall, is the
    gatehouse, which may safely be attributed to the latter part of the
    eleventh century. At the western angle, where the city wall joined
    the castle, was built a rectangular tower, the base of which still
    remains, and it is said at the north angle was a similar tower, the two
    thus flanking the north-west face. The wall had a high base or plinth,
    battering somewhat, and carrying the superstructure, which is vertical.
    There remain upon it two half-round solid bastions; one at the north
    end of the south-west face has three flat pilasters rising from the
    plinth, and is evidently pure Norman; the other, near the centre of
    the north-east face, is similar in pattern, but the pilasters are
    rather narrower and chamfered, and probably very late, or transition
    Norman. Most of the wall is rubble, but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> portion of the north-eastern
    front, near the site of the castle chapel, is composed of good blocks
    of ashlar, possibly of the age of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> The bank and wall have
    been removed in the centre of the north-west front, to make room for
    the Sessions House, an ungainly structure, ugly anywhere, but here
    especially out of place. The chapel stood in the court, near the
    western corner.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse is decidedly original, and a good example of a rude
    Norman gatehouse. It is about 30 feet square, with walls 6 feet
    thick. At each end is a full-centred archway, of 12 feet opening,
    very plain, having a square rib 2 feet broad, with deep recesses or
    ‚Äúnooks‚Äù of 2 feet on each side. The southern capital of the inner
    archway shows traces of Norman carving. There was no portcullis, each
    portal having doors; the space between the portals was covered with
    timber. On each of the two outer sides are two broad flat pilasters.
    The superstructure is lofty, and seems to have contained two stories.
    Above each portal are two windows, of 2 feet 6 inches opening, divided
    by a space of about 2 feet. The jambs are square, with a plain Norman
    cap or abacus. The present covering of each is formed of two inclined
    stones or lintels, which may be original, but are more probably late
    insertions. Above each pair is a larger single window. The inner
    portal opens at the level of the court. Outside, the ground is about
    10 feet below that level. No doubt there was a drawbridge falling upon
    a detached pier, whence a causeway, probably with one or two bridges,
    crossed the ditches and carried the approach. The <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall
    abuts against the gateway flush with its inner face, so that it has a
    projection outward of about 24 feet, flanking the adjacent curtain. In
    later days, probably during the time of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, two buttresses,
    or rather pilasters, 4 feet broad by 5 feet deep, have been built
    against the inner face, one on each side of the portal; and at the
    other end are a similar pair, but of 14 feet projection. These latter,
    at the battlement level, outside, are connected by a flat segmental
    arch; and the sort of barbican, or forebuilding thus formed contained
    the drawbridge, covered the gateway, and above had a flat roof, where
    archers could be posted to protect the approach. The old entrance
    is walled up, and pierced with two loops, which look early, but can
    scarcely be so. In the east side of the gatehouse a small doorway,
    in the Decorated style, has been pierced, possibly as a postern, for
    any lodge connected with it would have been outside the castle. The
    present entrance is, and for very many years has been, close west of,
    and outside the main gatehouse. This evidently was due to a wish to
    preserve the gatehouse, but to avoid the inconvenience of entering at
    so high a level. Probably when the new entrance was made the ditch at
    this point was filled up, all but a narrow gut, across which fell the
    drawbridge shown in the later drawings of the castle. When this was
    dispensed with the whole was made smooth, and Castle Street took its
    present aspect.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence as to what buildings, save the chapel, were
    contained within the court of the castle. There must of necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
    have been a hall, kitchen, lodgings, stabling, and barracks; and
    probably most of these buildings stood near or on the site of the
    Sessions House, where there seems to have been a postern gate. There
    is no evidence of a keep, nor, at so great a height, was any needed.
    Rectangular keeps, though found at Corfe, Sherborne, and Taunton, were
    not common in the west. A shell-keep, as at Trematon, Launceston,
    Dunster, Restormel, or Truro, would, in such a position, have been
    the usual structure; but the previous earthworks had converted the
    only site for a shell-keep into a pit so deep that it would have been
    commanded from the ramparts. Probably the Normans regarded the whole
    court as a shell-keep.</p>

  <p>Whether the city walls were built concurrently with the castle is
    unknown. Probably they were, for the water-gate, removed in 1815, had
    certainly a Norman arch, as had, though later, and in the transition
    style, Broad Gate, of which also Lysons gives a view. These walls
    crossed the ditches, and abutted upon that of the castle. That from
    the east gate, seen in the Club Garden, has been rebuilt; but the
    north-west wall is very perfect, and though the buttresses on its
    outside are of Decorated date, as were most of the gates of the city,
    the substance of the wall is original, and very strong. In its base,
    where it crosses the ditch, it contains a hollow place, much enlarged,
    and said to have been a dungeon, which is absurd. It probably was a
    culvert or sluice-gate, to allow the ditch to be drained and cleared
    out, for though these ditches could scarcely have permanently contained
    water, a wet season would have converted them into a pond.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE CASTLE YARD.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE scanty remains of this, the seat of the family of Hastings before
    they rose to their earldom of Pembroke, and now known as Castle Yard,
    are placed about a quarter of a mile south of Fillongley Church upon a
    small triangle of land formed by the beds and junction of two brooks
    which flow down from the south and the south-east to meet and form the
    point of the triangle to the north.</p>

  <p>In the space thus protected towards the north, west, and east, was
    constructed a rudely oval shell of masonry about 50 feet east and west
    by 80 feet north and south, traces of which are seen in five masses of
    stone rubble-work, of which four are overthrown and a fifth remains
    in its proper place. A light ridge connects these detached masses,
    and indicates the line of the curtain of which they formed a part.
    The fragment standing in its place seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> been connected with
    a curved recess, or, perhaps, a well-stair, but the others have been
    overthrown by gunpowder. The whole was on a small scale, and there are
    no visible traces of towers or gatehouse. The earth and rubbish heaped
    up in the interior of the area may cover foundations, and, no doubt, a
    light excavation here would disclose the plan of the whole structure
    and the place of the entrance, which, probably, was towards the east.</p>

  <p>Outside the walled area the ground falls slightly, and there are traces
    at about 30 yards‚Äô distance, towards the south, of a ditch and internal
    bank protecting this, by nature, the weakest side. The valley towards
    the east is occupied by one of the brooks which flows a few feet only
    from and below the wall. There is no trace of any second or outer
    circle of masonry, so that probably the castle was composed of a single
    ring wall, possibly set with turrets, but if so, of no great size.</p>

  <p>The whole castle must have been a very inconsiderable place, though
    from the steepness of the little valleys between which it stands, and
    the marshy character of the ground watered by the brooks, it evidently
    possessed much passive strength, and if garrisoned by determined men,
    could have held out for some time.</p>

  <p>Fillongley is unnoticed in any record older than the Conqueror‚Äôs
    Survey. We learn from Domesday that ‚ÄúFilungelei‚Äù contained two hides
    of land, of which one half-hide belonged to the Bishop of Coutances,
    and was held by Lewin; a second by the monks of Coventry; a third by
    a certain Alsi, who held it from before the Conquest; and a fourth by
    Robert le Despenser, which, though of less value, contained the church.
    Alsi may have resided upon the Castle hill. The half-hide held by the
    monks is identified with Old Fillongley, on the western side of the
    parish, and was held of them in the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> by Gerard de
    Alspath, whose name is preserved in Alspath Hall, in the south-west
    quarter of the parish. He held it as a fourth part of a knight‚Äôs
    fee. A part of this holding passed in some way from the ownership of
    the monks, who, in the time of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, held in it one-eighth of
    a fee of Lord Hastings. Part of Le Despenser‚Äôs share passed to the
    Marmions, and thence, it would seem, to the Earls of Leicester, one of
    whom probably enfeoffed of it either Walter or Hugh de Hastings, one
    of the earlier members of that family, who long continued to hold it
    of the Marmions and Le Despensers. Thus the family of Hastings were
    of Fillongley in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and it speedily became their
    chief residence in Warwickshire, and the nucleus of a considerable
    estate. John de Hastings, 29 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, had a license to crenellate
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">manerium suum et villam de ... Filungeleye</span>,‚Äù though the castle is
    probably considerably older. With the church was the advowson which,
    in the reign of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Lawrence Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, sold
    to Clinton, Earl of Huntingdon. Fillongley, though it appears in the
    inquisitions of the Hastings family, is not mentioned as a castle,
    being, in fact, too inconsiderable to be claimed by the Crown, and so
    entered upon the public <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>records, but it seems to have remained
    the chief, if not the only, residence of the family, until Henry de
    Hastings, in the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, married Joan de Cantelupe, who
    became a very great heiress, so that John, their son, the recipient of
    the above license, inheriting the castle of Abergavenny, resided there,
    as did occasionally his descendants. On the death of the last Hastings,
    Earl of Pembroke, Fillongley passed with much of his property to the
    Beauchamps, and so to the Nevilles, who held it when Dugdale wrote his
    very valuable history.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="FONMON_CASTLE_GLAMORGAN">FONMON CASTLE, GLAMORGAN.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">FONMON Castle was, no doubt, built by Sir John de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John soon after
    the conquest of Glamorgan; and part of the present building is original.</p>

  <p>The castle rises from the western edge of a narrow and deep ravine,
    which conveys a streamlet from Fonmon village into the Kenson.</p>

  <p>On its north front, but at some little distance from the castle, a
    similar steep bank slopes down direct to the Kenson, which there
    traverses a meadow, in earlier days probably an impassable morass.
    On its west and south sides the castle stands on table land, and was
    covered, no doubt, by a moat and outer wall. The keep, a rectangular
    building 45 feet high, and 25 feet north and south, by 43 feet east
    and west, including its walls, which are 5 feet thick, appears to be
    late Norman, and may be presumed to be Sir John de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs work.
    Additions, probably of early English and early Decorated date, enclose
    it on the north, east, and partially on the south sides; on the latter
    forming a considerable wing, a part of which is a square tower which
    caps the south-east angle, and is a principal feature in the general
    view of the building. Two bow towers of the same date project from the
    east front. The principal additions on the north are of the seventeenth
    century, and were erected without reference to defence.</p>

  <p>The outworks, with the exception of one tower which stands alone on
    the south-eastern front, about 140 yards from the castle, long since
    have given way to stabling, barns, and formal terraced gardens, most of
    which have in their turn disappeared. The remaining tower seems to have
    been the south-eastern termination of the defences of the outer court.</p>

  <p>The <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Johns resided, more or less, at Fonmon until towards the
    fourteenth century, when, by intermarriage with the heiresses
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> Paveley, Pawlet, and, finally, of Beauchamp of Bletsoe, they
    became powerful English lords, and removed their head-quarters into
    Bedfordshire. Fonmon was probably left to the care of a bailiff, though
    some cadets of the family settled at Highlight, and there remained
    after the sale of the property to Colonel Jones, about 1655. Since that
    period it has been regularly inhabited by the Jones family, as it now
    is by their descendant and representative, Robert Oliver Jones, Esq.</p>

  <p>The castle contains portraits of Cromwell and Ireton, and a fine one of
    Mr Robert Jones, grandfather of the present proprietor, by Reynolds.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="FOTHERINGAY_CASTLE_NORTHAMPTONSHIRE">FOTHERINGAY CASTLE, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE masonry of this castle has been entirely removed, but the original
    moated mound and earth-banks remain, and the lines of the masonry may
    be traced by the trenches dug when the foundations were grubbed up. The
    mound stands on the left bank of the river Nene, and of the buildings
    the principal, disposed nearly east and west, was very evidently the
    great hall in which Mary of Scotland was tried and executed.</p>

  <p>There is in ‚ÄúEllis‚Äôs Letters‚Äù (First Series, Vol. <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>) a draught plan,
    in Burghley‚Äôs hand, of the hall as it was ordered to be prepared for
    the trial.</p>

  <p>The ‚Äúgreat chamber‚Äù was 23 yards long with the window, and 7 yards
    broad. The length without the window was 21 yards. The window,
    therefore, was probably a bay or oriel, of 6 feet projection within.
    The draught plan was sent down with the figures blank to be filled in
    by special measurement.</p>

  <p>At the upper, probably the eastern, end, and in front of the window,
    was a chair for the Queen of England. Against the wall on her left,
    a bench for thirteen barons; on her right, leaving space for passage
    between it and the wall, was a bench for twelve earls. Across the hall,
    13 yards from the upper (east) end, and 8 yards from the lower end, was
    a bar, extending on the barons‚Äô side nearly to the wall, but on the
    earls‚Äô leaving space for passage. Within, close to the bar and opposite
    Elizabeth‚Äôs seat, was a chair for Mary.</p>

  <p>The points of the compass are not marked upon the plan, but it is
    clear, from the disposition of the passage, that the door was on that
    or the north side, and most probably near to its west end. The door
    of a castle-hall would never have opened towards the defences of the
    place, but into the inner court.</p>

  <p>The block for the execution was placed at the upper end of the hall;
    probably, therefore, where Elizabeth‚Äôs chair had stood during the
    trial.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

  <p>The fireplace in which, after the execution, the block and bloody
    drapery were burned, probably was placed in the centre of the south
    wall.</p>

  <p>Possibly, during a season of drought, some local antiquary may succeed
    in establishing the actual position of the door, the bay window, and
    the fireplace.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="GROSMONT_CASTLE_MONMOUTHSHIRE">GROSMONT CASTLE, MONMOUTHSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">GROSMONT is one of five strong places disposed along the right or
    south-west bank of the Munnow river, the others being, below it,
    Skenfrith, and above it Oldcastle, Longtown, and the fortified house
    of Perthir; Monmouth Castle, and the town beneath its protection,
    occupied the junction of the Munnow with the Wye. These are some of
    the fortified buildings scattered broadcast over the Welsh marshes,
    and especially abundant in the county of Monmouth, and the remains of
    which, always picturesque, are often tolerably perfect.</p>

  <p>In the rear of these castles on the Munnow were those of Brecknock,
    Tretower, Crickhowell, and Abergavenny, upon the Upper Usk; and over
    the whole of that country there is scarce a hill-top or point of
    vantage which is not occupied by some defensive earthwork, showing the
    importance attached to it by each of the several races, Celt, Roman,
    Saxon, and Norman, who in turn either attacked or defended this devoted
    soil.</p>

  <p>Grosmont, about four miles above Skenfrith and five below Oldcastle, is
    placed, like the former fortress, upon the high concavity of a sharp
    bend of the river, about a hundred yards from its margin. Very near to
    it is the fine old cross church, which, having shared in the prosperity
    of the castle, has escaped its decay, and still remains in tolerable
    repair, although requiring a few subtractions and restorations at the
    hand of a judicious architect.</p>

  <p>The castle is composed of a court or ward of irregular plan, more or
    less rectangular, with projections upon the south side, the wall of
    which contains a space of 110 feet by 70 feet, strengthened on the
    south by a larger and a smaller three-quarter mural tower, having
    a gateway upon the east face, and on the west traces of a building
    exterior to the curtain wall. The north side is occupied by a hall,
    also exterior to, or rather replacing the line of, the curtain, three
    of its four walls forming a part of the exterior defences of the
    building.</p>

  <p>The whole is placed within a ditch of great depth, and, indeed, the
    earthworks generally are of so formidable a character as to make it
    probable that they are earlier than the present building, or than any
    other work in masonry. The actual platform occupied by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> walls, and
    contained within the crest of the ditch, is about 150 feet in diameter.</p>

  <p>Outside the ditch, to the east and south, and covering the entrance
    of the castle, is a large demi-lune, or platform of earth, scarped
    towards the field, and upon which are traces of walls and a defence of
    the nature of a barbican. The main ditch, now traversed by a modern
    embankment, was evidently at one time crossed by the usual bridge, of
    which a part lifted. The gatehouse, if such it can be called, presents
    two lateral cheeks of wall, projecting on either side of the bridge,
    and thus forming a covered way, from each side of which a cruciform
    loop is directed along the ditch. The pointed vault of the entrance is
    broken, but there remain the ragged grooves for the portcullis, and the
    two holes which received the large wooden bar fastening the gate.</p>

  <p>Entering, on the right is the shell of the hall, 80 feet long by 27
    feet broad, out of all proportion to the area of the defences. The
    floor, of timber, was laid 6 feet above the level of the court, so as
    to give height to a spacious basement store-room or cellar, but which,
    however, has a large fireplace in its east wall. The hall has windows
    at each end, and four in each side; but probably only the six to the
    east belonged to the hall, the other two lighting a withdrawing-room.
    The position of the fireplace on the north side seems to mark the
    centre of the hall.</p>

  <p>On the left of the entrance the curtain extends to the south-east
    or smaller drum tower, and probably supported a spacious lean-to
    roof marked by the corbels or bearers for the upper wall-plate. This
    south-east tower seems to have been massive, but low, and to have been
    altered and enlarged at the gorge, on the side towards the court, which
    now projects inwards in a rectangular form. When this addition was made
    the tower seems to have been raised to three or perhaps four stories,
    and near its summit is a bold cordon.</p>

  <p>A strong curtain extends from this to the south-west drum-tower, of
    larger dimensions, and broken down towards the court. The floors of
    these two towers were of timber. Between them, and parallel to the
    curtain, seem to have been some buildings, probably barracks.</p>

  <p>The buildings outside of, and built against, the west curtain projected
    boldly into the moat. They are in great decay. Here was the fireplace,
    the flue from which, wrought out in the substance of the curtain, rises
    above it as an elegant octagonal chimney shaft, the summit of which is
    crowned by the elegant lanthorn or spiracle which has so often been
    drawn and is so well known.</p>

  <p>Grosmont, as it now appears, is of moderate size and much mutilated;
    but its towers and walls, though stripped of their ashlar, are still
    standing, and the earthworks are large, bold, and well-defined.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be its ancient history, the present building presents
    nothing earlier than the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> The additions seem to have
    been in the Decorated style, and, probably, are of one date,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> that of
    the reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> After the South Welsh conquest, Grosmont was
    one of the numerous De Braose castles, and passed by inheritance to
    the Cantelupes. It then fell into the possession of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, who
    granted it to Hubert de Burgh. In the well-known war waged by the
    Welsh and Richard Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke, against Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, it
    was besieged by Llewelyn and relieved by the king, who occupied it as
    head-quarters during the latter part of the campaign. After De Burgh‚Äôs
    fall, Henry regranted the castle to the Earl of Lancaster, and it has
    since, with the somewhat earlier castles of Skenfrith and Whitecastle,
    remained attached to the duchy. Henry, Crouchback‚Äôs grandson, was here
    born, and hence styled Henry of Grosmont. Probably he was the author of
    the principal additions.</p>

  <p>The adjacent church contains a late Norman font, with cylindrical base
    and octagonal bowl; and the pier arches of the central tower are also
    Pointed Norman. Most of the remainder of the church is early English,
    and probably of the date of the castle; but there is a Decorated north
    porch, and also some other parts in the same style, which may have been
    the work of the artist who completed the additions to the castle and
    designed its elegant chimney-shaft and finial.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="GUILDFORD_CASTLE_SURREY">GUILDFORD CASTLE, SURREY.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">GUILDFORD Castle, of which the keep was always the most prominent, and
    is now the chief remaining, feature, is in position, age, structure,
    and dimensions, a very remarkable fortress.</p>

  <p>It is true, indeed, that though of great age, neither the town nor the
    castle have played any great part in English history. The town was
    never walled; the castle never stood a siege. No considerable battle
    was ever witnessed from its towers; no parliament or great council
    was ever held within its hall. Though always a royal manor, and long
    maintained as a royal residence, it was used also as a prison, and is
    but rarely mentioned, either in the records or by the chroniclers.
    The castle was not garrisoned in the great civil war, and so escaped
    being dismantled and blown up by either king or parliament. Its state
    of decay is due to the effects of time, powerfully aided by the local
    greed for building materials. Nevertheless, though wanting in many of
    the points of interest often attaching to English military buildings,
    Guildford Castle has certain peculiarities of its own not unworthy of
    notice, and which it is the object of this notice to set forth and
    explain.</p>

  <p>The great chalk range which forms the bulwark of London and the
    southern limit of the vale of the Thames, from its mouth to the border
    of Hampshire, is contracted towards the west into a narrow but elevated
    ridge, which extends from Reigate nearly to Farnham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> and, resting upon
    the firestone and gault of the Weald of Kent and Surrey, supports the
    clay and gravels of the London basin.</p>

  <p>This ridge, generally unbroken, is traversed by two well-known gorges
    about twelve miles apart, of which the eastern is occupied by the Mole
    at Dorking and Mickleham, and the western by</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">‚ÄúThe chalkey Wey, that rolls a milky wave.‚Äù</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The Wey, the tributaries of which rise widely over much of Surrey
    and the eastern part of Hampshire, is, where it cleaves the chalk, a
    considerable stream, much less milky than in the days, or rather in
    the verse, of Pope; and twelve miles below the pass it falls into the
    Thames at Weybridge.</p>

  <p>The town of Guildford is placed upon the right or eastern bank of the
    river, well within, that is, north-east of the gorge, and within and
    a little above the town is the castle. As the ridge is here steep and
    lofty and the gorge deep and moderately narrow, it might be supposed
    that this pass would at all times have been important to whoever wished
    to defend London and the Thames from invaders from the south. In
    position it is to the south of London what Berkhampstead Castle is on
    the north; both are placed in gorges of chalk, both upon tributaries
    of the Thames; both are late Norman castles, founded upon earlier
    English earthworks; and both were for centuries held direct by the
    Crown. Guildford, however, unlike Berkhampstead, though the nucleus
    of a large town, has no military history. Although Surrey and Sussex
    are by no means deficient in traces of early occupation, the immediate
    neighbourhood of Guildford is in this respect almost a blank. An
    early trackway has been talked of as taking the ridge of the Downs,
    and traces of an irregular, and therefore British, camp are said to
    have been formerly observed on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martha‚Äôs hill; but the long chalk
    crest and slopes of the Downs, so tenacious of the slightest works
    ever executed on their surface, are not known to exhibit any traces
    of the encampments or pits or other works usually attributed to the
    British, which, considering the dense forest that certainly extended
    to the foot of the high ground on the south side, and probably on the
    north, is very singular. Antiquaries, indeed, have placed the capital
    of the British Regni at Guildford and the city of Vindomis at Farnham,
    but nothing beyond general probabilities have been brought forward
    in favour of either supposition. It is curious, also, to observe how
    completely Celtic names have disappeared from the neighbourhood. Even
    the rivers, the first to receive and the last to change their names‚Äîthe
    Wey, the Wandle, and the Mole‚Äîare Saxon, as are the names of Guildford,
    the chief town of the county and district, Farnham, the ancient
    episcopal seat, and the villages about them.</p>

  <p>Neither are there any very decided marks of Roman occupation in
    Guildford. The Castle Hill at Hescomb, Hilbury in Puttenham, and
    Holmbury in Ockley, are said to be rectangular, and therefore Roman
    earthworks; but neither of the two great Roman roads from the south
    passes through Guildford. The Watling Street leads from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> Canterbury,
    by Rochester, to Southwark; and the Icknild Street, from Chichester,
    takes the pass of Mickleham in its way to the same destination. It is
    very curious that a town so remarkable in position, so strongly posted,
    and so directly in the way from the south-west to London, and withal so
    sheltered, and placed close to pastures so fertile, should exhibit no
    marks of occupation by the Romans or the earlier or later Britons.</p>

  <p>The early history of Guildford, like its name, is Saxon, and, like
    its name, savours wholly of the arts of peace. Of the ‚Äúguild,‚Äù or
    mercantile community, which in early times must have been established
    on the ‚ÄúFord‚Äù of the Wey, nothing is recorded; but from the lingering
    presence of such names as Burgh Road, Burgh Field, and the Bury, it
    has been supposed that the earliest Saxon municipality was seated on
    the west, and not, as now, on the east bank of the river. It has been
    said that the cause of this was the establishment of the fortress on
    the east bank, and the consequent want of space for private dwellings.
    But the fact is probably just the reverse. A fortress, whether Saxon
    or Norman, would, as a rule, attract inhabitants to place themselves
    under its protection; and, however spacious may have been the area
    enclosed‚Äîand a little under six acres is the very utmost that has ever
    been assigned to it‚Äîthere must always have been ample room between the
    walls and the river to the north, where the present town is located. If
    ever the town stood upon the west bank, the balance of probability is
    in favour of its having been transferred across the stream as soon as
    the earliest stronghold was established there.</p>

  <p>There is reason to believe that the principal thoroughfare of the
    present town‚Äîthe High Street‚Äîexisted in the thirteenth century,
    and probably some centuries earlier. Guildford is a borough by
    prescription, and therefore may be of any English date, however
    early. It has paid the castle the fitting compliment of placing it
    on the borough shield, which bears ‚Äúon a mount vert, a castle.‚Äù The
    town stands in three parishes: <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs, which includes the castle;
    Trinity; and on the west bank of the river, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas.</p>

  <p>The recorded history of Guildford has no ignoble beginning. It was the
    property of Alfred, and is first mentioned in his will, between 872 and
    885. ‚ÄúTo Ethelwald, my brother‚Äôs son,‚Äù says the great king, ‚ÄúI bequeath
    the manor at Godalming and at Gyldeford, and at Steyning.‚Äù On the death
    of Ethelwald, childless, Guildford reverted to the West Saxon crown. In
    the following century, in 1036, Guildford was the scene of the capture
    of Alfred, the elder brother of the Confessor, and of the massacre of
    his Norman attendants. As to the particulars of the event, and as to
    the parts played in it by Godwin, Queen Emma, and Harold Harefoot,
    testimonies differ, but all agree in the mention of Guildford as the
    place to which the Atheling was conveyed.</p>

  <p>When the Conqueror marched northward from Canterbury, he went by the
    Watling Street, through Rochester, to Southwark, and thence ascending
    to Wallingford, turned the position of Guildford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> and placed himself
    between it and the Thames. Its name even does not occur till late in
    the reign, and then only in the General Survey. From that survey,
    it appears that it had remained Crown property. No castle is there
    mentioned, but that it contained a residence is more than probable,
    both because it had been so long a royal demesne and from what is
    stated as to the Atheling‚Äôs reception there.</p>

  <p>In Domesday Book, as now, Guildford was in the Hundred of Woking.
    The chief of the royal tenants was Ranulf Flambard, afterwards so
    celebrated both for his rapacity and his magnificence. He was rector of
    Godalming, and as such held lands in Guildford, which were afterwards
    appended to his canonry at Salisbury, to be eventually resumed by
    Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and attached, with the castle, to the Crown. In 2 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>
    the king gave Godalming hundred and manor to the church of Sarum, in
    exchange for the castle of Devizes and Rueles, or Erlestoke, then held
    by the bishop of that see.</p>

  <p>The Conqueror granted a large plot of ground, upon which much of the
    modern town north of the castle and south of High-street now stands, to
    a family of the name of Testard, who held it for several generations
    by a singular tenure recorded in Blount, and are reputed to have built
    the two churches of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary and Trinity for the use of their tenants‚Äîa
    fact which would go to show that the town was already standing within
    convenient reach of these churches, of which one is still mainly
    Norman, and of large area; and, further, makes it improbable that the
    castle <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> ever extended far to the north, as the Conqueror
    was not likely to have granted away any part of the older area. The
    historians of Surrey estimate the population of Guildford recorded in
    Domesday at 700 persons.</p>

  <p>The internal evidence of the buildings of the castle makes it most
    probable that the whole of it, keep, hall, and domestic buildings, with
    its <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall enclosing above five acres, was constructed
    by Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> very early in the reign; but the castle is not mentioned
    in his reign, nor in that of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> In the Pipe Rolls, the town
    appears from time to time as contributing to tallage and other imposts,
    and in 1 Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the park is named in connexion with the canons of
    Sarum. It also appears from the Rot. Curi√¶ Regis, 6 Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, that an
    assize was held there. Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, probably when he built the castle,
    seems to have formed a royal park on the opposite side of the river,
    north of the Hog‚Äôs Back, the site of which is still indicated by such
    names as Guildford Park, Wilderness, Stag Hill, and the Manor Farm, the
    latter being probably the site of the royal lodge.</p>

  <p>Captain James, who conducted the Ordnance Survey of the district and
    paid great attention to the ancient boundaries, and to whose researches
    much that concerns the castle is due, is of opinion that the area of
    the park was on the north, west, and east, conterminous with the parish
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas, and that on the south it was bounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> by the crest of
    the Hog‚Äôs Back. This tract is said anciently to have contained four
    manors, but at this time it is composed of three very ancient farms,
    all within one manor.</p>

  <p>King John, whose suspicious nature and feverish activity led him to be
    always in motion, was at Guildford nineteen times in eleven different
    years. In 1200 he kept Christmas here and equipped his household in
    new liveries, which, to the king‚Äôs great but dissembled disgust, the
    Archbishop of Canterbury proceeded to surpass in splendour. In 1202 he
    was not here; but there is a charge for ¬£6. 5<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for work done upon
    the king‚Äôs houses, and ¬£1. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for the transport of wine, and 4<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>
    for the repair of the gaol in the castle. This is the first mention of
    the castle, and it is curious that it is connected with its use as a
    prison.</p>

  <p>In 1204, John was here 9th October and 7th, 8th, 9th November; and in
    this year ¬£10 was paid for the repair of the king‚Äôs houses, and ¬£40
    for the expenses of his chamber. John Fitz-Hugh, sheriff of Surrey
    and Sussex, 1208, 1210‚Äì11‚Äì12‚Äì13 and 1214, was then made keeper of the
    park. In 1205, the king was here 9th, 10th, 11th of April; 1st August;
    and 30th, 31st of October. On the 7th February, two tuns of wine, the
    king‚Äôs prisage, were sent here, and 15th May, two hundred porkers went
    from hence to Southampton, a supply of flesh to London, and a net to
    Southwark.</p>

  <p>King John was here 28th, 29th, 30th December, 1206, and in 1207,
    27th, 28th December. In this year, 28th August, the sheriff of Hants
    was to take certain prisoners from Sarum Castle and deliver them to
    the constable of Guildford Castle. This is the second mention of the
    fortress, and also as a gaol. In 1208, John was here 25th, 26th, 27th
    January; and 5th, 6th, 7th April; and in 1210, on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd
    January; and 8th March. Also in 1212, on the 12th, 13th, and 14th May.</p>

  <p>In 1213, on the 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th December, King John was here.
    3rd January the custody of the county of Surrey, with the castle of
    Guildford, was committed to Reginald, son of Reginald de Cornhill, to
    be held during pleasure, and John Fitz-Hugh was ordered to give it up
    to him. The Cornhills were a family of farmers-general of the revenues
    of the counties south of London, and between 1164 and 1215 Gervase,
    Henry, Ralph, and Reginald de Cornhill appear as sheriffs of Surrey and
    Sussex then combined.</p>

  <p>In this year, 1213, also one hundred deer, ‚Äú<span lang="la">damos et damas</span>,‚Äù were given
    from Guildford to the Archbishop of Canterbury to replenish his park.
    In 1214, 24th August, 53<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> was allowed for the entertainment of the
    Papal legate, then on his way to revoke the Interdict. Rochester and
    Guildford Castles are mentioned together in this year as undergoing
    some repairs.</p>

  <p>In 1215, King John was here for a whole week from the 15th to the 21st
    of January. His forces had been beaten at Bovines in the preceding
    July, and he had come to Guildford from London, after receiving the
    demands of the confederate barons agreed and sworn to at Bury. He was
    probably at that time actively employed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> obtaining support from the
    clergy, in the hope of evading the great charter, which, nevertheless,
    he was forced to agree to in the following June. On the 18th November,
    John Fitz-Hugh, who again was sheriff, was ordered to give up the
    castle to whomsoever Peter Bishop of Winchester should name to receive
    it. It was probably made over to Reginald de Cornhill.</p>

  <p>In 1216, John paid his last visit to Guildford, and remained there
    during the 20th, 21st, and 22nd of April. In the June following, the
    Dauphin Louis was here on his way from Sandwich. With Guildford, he
    held Reigate, then a castle of the Warrens, and Farnham.</p>

  <p>Guildford, both castle and park, are mentioned not unfrequently in the
    reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> In 1222, 19th November, ¬£200 was paid for the royal
    expenses going thither from London. In 1223, 19th January, King Henry
    was at Guildford. 18th April, allowance was made for building a house
    of alms in the king‚Äôs court there. This was probably an office for the
    receipt of deodands, fines, forfeitures, escheats of felons‚Äô goods, and
    other moneys accruing from incidents of feudal tenures, and, it has
    been supposed, appropriated to charitable uses. 14th May, works were in
    progress on the king‚Äôs houses, and 27th May, Richard Dale had ten marcs
    for repairs in the park; and again, in October, money was paid for
    fencing it. In 1224, repairs were done to the king‚Äôs houses, and half
    a marc paid for making a door. The fencing of the park was proceeded
    with. In 10 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, William de Coniers was governor for the king,
    as were in 30 and 53 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Elias Mansel and William d‚ÄôAguillon.</p>

  <p>In 24 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 4th April, the sheriff of Surrey was ordered to
    repair the glass windows of the king‚Äôs houses and chapel at Guildford,
    broken by the storm, and the houses unroofed thereby were to be
    restored. In 29 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the vill of Guildford is mentioned as
    vested in the king; the sheriff was to enclose the area by the kitchen
    which the king had purchased, with a wall conveniently answering to the
    other wall by which the said court is enclosed; and he is to repair the
    two piers of the king‚Äôs hall, which need repair because they are out
    of the perpendicular. In 30 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 3rd February, the sheriff of
    Surrey and Sussex is to make ‚Äúa certain chamber at Guildford, for the
    use of Edward, the king‚Äôs son, with proper windows well barred, which
    is to be 50 feet long and 26 feet wide ... with a privy chamber ...
    so that the chamber of the same Edward be above, and the chamber of
    the king‚Äôs noble valets underneath, with fitting windows, and a privy
    chamber, and a chimney in each chamber. And he is to make under the
    wall towards the east, opposite the east part of the king‚Äôs hall, a
    certain pent-house, which, although narrow, shall be competently long,
    with a chimney and private chamber, for the queen‚Äôs wardrobe; and to
    make in the queen‚Äôs chamber a certain window equal in width to the two
    windows which are now there, and as much wider as may be, between the
    two walls, and as high as becomingly may be, with two marble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> pillars;
    and to wainscote that window above, and close it with glass windows
    between the pillars, with panels which may be opened and shut, and
    large wooden shutters internally to close over the glass windows; and
    to cause the upper window in the king‚Äôs hall towards the west, nigh the
    dais, to be fitted up with white glass lights, so that in one half of
    that glass window there be made a certain king sitting on a throne, and
    in the other half a certain queen likewise sitting on a throne.‚Äù</p>

  <p>In 40 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, these decorations and alterations were still
    continued, for on the 3rd January, the king being at Guildford, orders
    the sheriff of Sussex to deliver ¬£100 to the wardens of the king‚Äôs
    works at Guildford, ‚Äúto pay off certain arrears due for the same works,
    and for wainscoting the king‚Äôs chapel, the queen‚Äôs chapel, the king‚Äôs
    chamber, and the other chambers newly built there; and for making the
    great windows in the king‚Äôs chapel; for barring the windows of the
    king‚Äôs new chamber with iron; making the porch to the hall, of stone;
    for painting in the hall there, opposite the king‚Äôs seat, the story
    of Dives and Lazarus; making a certain figure with beasts on the same
    seat; and lengthening the chamber of the king‚Äôs chaplain there.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Also on the 5th May following, the sheriff of Surrey and Sussex is
    ordered to whitewash the king‚Äôs hall at Guildford within and without.
    On the 17th June, 45 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1261, the king visited Guildford, and
    doubtless examined and took pleasure in the various improvements and
    decorations he had ordered. All this luxury was probably confined to
    the hall and royal apartments in the middle ward, for an entry on the
    Hundred rolls at the commencement of the reign shows that the Sussex
    county prisoners were kept at Guildford, and no doubt in the keep.</p>

  <p>In 50 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Prince Edward was at Guildford engaged in putting
    down Sir Adam Gordon, a soldier who, having been outlawed after
    Evesham fight, had turned freebooter, and made the Surrey woodlands
    very insecure. Edward came up with and attacked him between Farnham
    and Alton, took him prisoner in single combat, got him a pardon, and
    presented him to the queen then at Guildford. At the end of Henry‚Äôs
    reign, 52 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the ‚ÄúKing‚Äôs Mills‚Äù were removed farther down the
    stream, probably to the site now occupied by their modern successors.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> became possessed, in due course, of Guildford, and in 27
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1299, the park, castle, and farm of the town were assigned
    as part of the dower of Margaret, the king‚Äôs second wife, and on her
    death, 10 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, they reverted to the Crown. Edward was here, 20th
    January, 31 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1303, resting on his way from Odiham to Windsor.</p>

  <p>In 35 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1306, Henry de Say, keeper of the prisoners indicted
    at the Sussex Assizes, and lodged in Guildford Castle, petitioned that
    an officer might be sent to receive their fines and chattels, according
    to their offences, and that a stronger prison may be provided, the
    castle being insecure for so many prisoners. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> answer, recorded
    on the rolls of Parliament, is terse:‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">Si carcer sit nimis debilis,
    faciat, Custos, emendari; si nimis strictus, faciat elargari; quia Rex
    non est avisatus mutare locum prisonarum suarum: vel saltem teneat eos
    in vinculis fortioribus</span>.‚Äù ‚ÄúDouble iron the prisoners‚Äù was at one time a
    usual, and certainly an economical, way of securing their safety. It is
    probable that it was under these circumstances of great pressure that
    the mural oratory in the keep was employed as a prison.</p>

  <p>In the king‚Äôs circular to the sheriff, 1 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, 1307, 15th
    December, which was followed by the edict confiscating the goods of the
    Templars, the sheriff of Surrey and Sussex was ordered to repair to
    Guildford. In 15 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Oliver de Burdegala, governor, had a writ
    of privy seal directing the castle to be victualled and garrisoned.</p>

  <p>Guildford, 2 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1328, was the head-quarters of the sheriff
    of Surrey, who was ordered to go there to prevent tournaments from
    being held. On the 8th March, 1329, the king was at Guildford; also
    28th February and 26th December, 1330; 18th‚Äì20th November, 1331; 2nd
    September, 1334; and 18th‚Äì24th April, 1336; so that the castle was in
    not infrequent use as a royal residence. In this last year the king
    granted the town in fee farm to the corporation, reserving only the
    park and castle. On the 23rd April, 1337, 11 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the king
    ordered that Robert d‚ÄôArtoys should have a right to be hospitably
    received should he visit the royal castles of Guildford, Wallingford,
    or Somerton, and he might sport in the park at Guildford.</p>

  <p>In the same year, 24th December, Edward was himself at Guildford, as
    he was in 1340, and again 27th‚Äì28th December, 1347, in which year the
    commonalty of Sussex petitioned that Chichester in place of Guildford
    might be the county gaol. The petition was set aside, and in 41 Edward
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> the sheriff still held his official residence in the castle, which
    was the prison, as before, for the two counties. 42 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1368,
    28th July, the king was here. 43 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the custody of the castle
    and park was given to Helmyng Legatte for life. Edward was again here,
    45 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1371, on the 12th of May, probably for the last time.</p>

  <p>In 1 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> Sir Simon Burley was constable of the castle, and
    afterwards Sir Hugh Waterton, on whose death, 10 Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, Sir John
    Stanley had the office also for life, and his appointment was confirmed
    by Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> By that time the custody of the park was evidently an
    office more coveted than that of the castle.</p>

  <p>What occurred in the castle during the wars of York and Lancaster is
    not known, save that it was the scene of no event of importance, and it
    certainly continued still to play the ignoble part of a common prison,
    for in 3 Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>, 1487, the old complaint is revived, and the
    county of Sussex again petitions for a gaol of its own, and under its
    own sheriff, suggesting Lewes as a proper place. This time the prayer
    was granted, and probably the Surrey prisoners either then or soon
    afterwards were bestowed elsewhere, though the two counties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> continued
    long after this to be placed under one sheriff. As late as 1620 a
    Sussex gentleman, Nicholas Eversfield, was sheriff of the two counties,
    and the jurisdiction does not appear to have been finally divided till
    1637.</p>

  <p>Finally, in 1611‚Äì12, after having been attached to the Crown at
    least from the days of Alfred, or 700 years, the castle and its
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> were granted by James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> to Francis Carter, of
    Guildford, who died in 1617, and whose son, John Carter, is described
    as dwelling in the castle in 1623. His eldest son Francis died in 1668,
    leaving a daughter only, and it is his brother, the second son, John
    Carter, whose initials, ‚ÄúJ. C., 1699,‚Äù stand upon a tablet within and
    above the great gateway in Quarry Street. The castle has since remained
    in private hands, and is now the property of Lord Grantley.</p>

  <p>The above extracts, mainly taken from those given by Mr. Parker in his
    valuable volumes on Domestic Architecture in the Middle Ages, will
    have shown that the fittings and adornments of the castle were chiefly
    due to Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> That prince, who was a great patron of the arts, and
    especially of architecture and painting, paid great attention to the
    royal residences. Unfortunately, his decorations were for the most part
    confined to the hall and principal domestic apartments, but few of
    which anywhere have survived. At Guildford, the destruction has been
    peculiarly sweeping, and the only remaining structure, the keep, does
    not seem to have participated in the royal care. The keeps of Norman
    castles, inhabited but rarely, and only during a siege, even by those
    who built them, seem very soon to have been altogether deserted for
    more convenient lodgings in the lower and more spacious wards. The keep
    was then used as a storehouse or barrack, or, as at Guildford, as a
    prison, and very little was spent upon its repairs, and nothing upon
    its decoration. It is, however, in consequence of this neglect, that
    the Norman keeps, where they have not been pulled down, remain pretty
    much as they were originally built, or with only such additions as may
    easily be detected, or such diminutions as may readily be supplied.
    This is particularly the case with the keep at Guildford, the additions
    to, or alterations in, which are of the rudest character, and may
    readily be detected, while of the masonry of the original structure
    little is wanting save the parapets and angle turrets and some details
    connected with the approach and entrance.</p>

  <p>Guildford Castle occupied a natural platform of nearly six acres upon
    the slope of the chalk hill, far below its summit, and from 40 to
    80 feet above the river. The platform, inclining gently towards the
    stream, terminates at about 80 yards from its bank in a low cliff of
    from 10 to 12 feet high, in parts replaced by, and in parts resting
    upon, a steep, natural slope or talus, which dies away 40 feet lower
    down into the meads traversed by the river. The crest of this cliff or
    talus is occupied by Quarry Street, and forms the west front of the
    castle. Towards the north, the river is more distant, and the slope of
    the platform far more gradual. On this side, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> High Street and the
    present town of Guildford intervene between the castle and the river.</p>

  <p>The keep stands on the eastern and highest part of the platform, and
    commands the rest of the castle, as the castle commands the town; and
    here are what appear to be the remains of the English residence. At
    the foot of the steep, a mound, wholly artificial, but resting upon
    an inclined natural base, has been thrown up, composed of chalk, in
    form conical, truncated, and with a level summit, no doubt originally
    circular, and still nearly so, and about 90 feet diameter. The base
    is about 200 feet. Between the mound and the adjacent steep hill-side
    is the main, and perhaps a trace of a second and outer, ditch. This
    inner ditch, about 60 feet broad and 12 to 20 feet deep, sweeps round
    the foot of the mound on the east, north, and south sides, the ends
    dying out on reaching the platform on the west below. The ditch, always
    dry, has long been cultivated as a garden, and was no doubt once
    considerably deeper. Its north limb is partially built upon by the
    houses in Castle Street, and is, in consequence, nearly obliterated. It
    is traversed at the north-east quarter by a narrow causeway of earth,
    which, no doubt, represents an older causeway of stone, provided with
    a drawbridge, and forming a direct entrance for foot passengers and
    perhaps horses, to the keep. Beyond this, the east and south-east, in
    the extra-parochial plot called the ‚ÄúBowling Green,‚Äù are very slight
    traces of what may have been a second and outer ditch, a not unlikely
    security to have been provided by the inhabitants of the mound against
    an attack on this the weakest, because the commanded, side.</p>

  <p>The mound on the eastern face, measured from the scarp of the ditch,
    is about 30 feet high, but on the western side, where it rises from a
    lower level, it is about 50 feet, or 92 feet above the river. The mound
    and the ditch evidently supported and protected the dwelling of the
    English lord, and it is probable that upon the platform below, where
    the Norman king afterwards placed his hall and offices, were lodged
    the serfs and dependents of the earlier household. Judging from the
    close analogy of Leicester, Tamworth, Tutbury, and other earthworks of
    known date, the earthworks of Guildford may, with great probability, be
    referred to the earlier part of the tenth century.</p>

  <p>The keep, a rectangular structure, covers the eastern slope of the
    mound, but is placed a little to the south of its central line, so as
    to allow of a gateway (now gone) at its north-east angle, and a passage
    up the mound outside the north wall. The east or lower wall rests on
    the undisturbed ground, a little above the level of the scarp of the
    ditch, and the west or upper wall upon the edge of the level summit of
    the mound, nearly the whole of which thus extends undisturbed to the
    west and north-west of the building. The difference in level of the
    base of the two faces of the keep is about 15 feet. It is exceedingly
    rare to find a rectangular keep placed upon an artificial mound.
    Guildford, Christchurch, and Clun are the only recorded examples.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

  <p>The keep stands nearly by the points of the compass, measuring 46
    feet north and south, by 52 feet east and west. The wall is perfect
    to the base of the parapet, a height on the west front of about 63
    feet. The masonry of the lower side contains more ashlar, and is of
    better quality than the rest, to prevent the structure from slipping.
    Of the depth of the foundations nothing is known, but the thickness
    of the wall‚Äîat least 11 feet at the visible base‚Äîwould serve to
    distribute the load, and chalk, even when made ground, does not make
    a bad foundation. There was, no doubt, a risk in placing so heavy a
    building upon an artificial hill, even though a couple of centuries
    old, but the result has justified the means employed, for there is not
    a crack or mark of settlement in the whole edifice. Grose represents
    some half-buried arches on the south side, not now visible, but which,
    if they ever existed, which is more than doubtful, might indicate
    that parts of the building rested on piers, carried down to the solid
    ground. However, enough of the wall is bared to show that this is not
    the case. What Grose took for an arch was probably a low course of
    inclined or half-herring-bone masonry. Others have described an opening
    on this side supposed to lead to a sub-basement vault which there is
    no reason for supposing to exist. The machicolations cited in evidence
    as defending this fabulous doorway are the vents of a garderobe in the
    upper story.</p>

  <p>The four faces of the keep are generally alike. Each is flanked by two
    pilasters of 4 feet 6 inches wide, by 9 feet projection, so placed as
    not to cap the angle, but to convert it into a hollow or re-entering
    one. This hollow was left open, not filled up, as at Scarborough and
    elsewhere, by a bold bead or engaged column. In the centre of each face
    is a third and similar pilaster, but 5 feet wide. Probably these rested
    below upon a plinth common to the whole building; but if so, this is
    gone. Each pilaster is of equal breadth and projection throughout,
    having no sets-off. The central pilasters run up to the base of the
    parapet, now gone. Those at the angles were continued to form the usual
    square turrets, of which some slight though clear remains still rise
    above the curtain.</p>

  <p>The material employed for the exterior is chiefly Bargate stone, from
    the bed representing the chalk marl immediately beneath the chalk. This
    is worked up as rubble, interspersed irregularly with courses of the
    same stone laid herring-bone fashion, for which the larger and flatter
    stones have been selected. The work is very rough. The herring-bone
    courses are laid at all heights and distances; some broken, some mere
    single inclined stones, and here and there, especially near the top,
    are occasional courses of flints, some of which look like insertions.
    The angles, salient and re-entering, of the pilasters, are of the
    same stone, cut as ashlar and well jointed; but between these quoins
    the pilasters are usually of rubble, sometimes herring-boned. Above
    the parapets the angle turrets seem to have been of ashlar. There is
    no string-course, shelf, or set-off upon the face of the wall. The
    west-central pilaster, being pierced by the entrance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> is mainly of
    ashlar, as are the pilaster and adjacent wall, about the north-east
    angle of the building, where the gate of the ward seems, from traces
    in the masonry, to have abutted. Here, too, the joints being very wide
    are made good with single or double rows of thin ordinary bright-red
    roofing tiles. The base of the east face was repaired about forty
    years ago, and now has a modern ashlar plinth of about 15 feet high.
    The ashlar within reach on the other faces has been pillaged, and the
    base of the wall generally is very hollow and ragged. The hearting of
    the walls throughout seems composed of chalk and Bargate stone, very
    roughly laid and grouted.</p>

  <p>The walls are everywhere pierced with putlog holes, about 4 inches
    square, indications of the method of construction, and probably
    originally but loosely stopped to allow the work to dry and for the
    convenience of future repairs. There are no large holes above, and
    no signs of a bretasche having been employed. Four double windows on
    the upper floor and one on the east face of the middle floor, though
    original, have been fitted up with cut brick mullions and arches
    of perhaps two hundred years ago, the work, no doubt, of the first
    purchaser. All earlier alterations seem to have been effected in stone.</p>

  <p>Having thus disposed of the general exterior of the keep, the next step
    is to describe its interior details. Allowing for the removed plinth or
    casing, three of the faces are about 11 feet thick and the fourth or
    east about 14, so that the interior dimensions are 24 feet north and
    south, by 27 feet east and west. The building is composed of a basement
    and two upper stories, and the floors and roof were of timber. There is
    no evidence of any subterranean chamber, and no reason for supposing
    one.</p>

  <p>The basement on the level of the top of the mound is about 12 feet
    high. The walls are pierced in the centre of the north and south faces
    with a round-headed recess 5 feet wide and about the same height to the
    springing. The sides and roof converge to an exterior loop, and the
    base is stepped up to it. The work is good plain rubble. The east and
    west walls were originally solid, and the only entrance to this floor
    must have been by a ladder and trap from the floor above. It was of
    course a store or cellar, as usual.</p>

  <p>At a later date, a doorway, 4 feet 6 inches broad and 8 feet to the
    springing, has been cut through the west wall near the north end.
    This has a slightly pointed arch. Its masonry is of small weak rubble
    without any dressings; and this, and the absence of bond with the
    older work, show it to be an insertion. In the north-east corner, the
    wall has been rudely cut away to some depth to form a fireplace and
    an oven. The bricks composing these have been removed, and a recent
    pier of masonry supports the wall above. The chimney shaft of this and
    a fireplace in the floor above have been formed by cutting away the
    inner face of the wall, which has been rudely restored. No doubt all
    this is the work of the purchaser, who seems to have lived in the keep
    and converted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> basement into a kitchen. In the south-west corner
    is a small platform of stone, said to have carried a wooden stair
    communicating with the floor above, and of the date of the kitchen.
    This is probable enough. One of the stones is a late Norman capital,
    brought from some other part of the castle. The whole interior of this
    basement is rubble. It contained neither fireplace nor garderobe. The
    two loops, its only light, are about 18 inches high, and were probably
    4 inches broad, though now increased by weather to 6 inches.</p>

  <p>The first or state floor was about 30 feet high, fairly lighted, and
    contained various mural chambers. In the centre of the west side was
    the entrance from without, and in each of the other three sides a
    window. These were of two lights, or rather composed of two tall,
    narrow, round-headed windows, coupled under one round head outside and
    a similar recess inside. These recesses commenced about a foot above
    the floor level, and are 4 feet 4 inches wide and to the springing
    about 12 feet high. Their sides are parallel, not convergent, and
    each contained four steps ascending towards the window. There are
    no mouldings or decorations, but the quoins are ashlar. The window,
    arches, imposts, and jambs are plain and good. The central window piers
    or mullions are gone, but in two cases the small head arches remain. In
    the third case, that in the east face, the window has been removed and
    replaced by one in brick, but the recess is untouched.</p>

  <p>The entrance is 3 feet 4 inches broad, 9 feet high, and about 14 feet
    from the ground. It is lined with good ashlar; but with a barrel-vault,
    round-headed, in rubble. The outer portal occupies the whole breadth
    of the central pilaster, being about 5 feet wide. It is very slightly,
    but decidedly, pointed. There is no portcullis groove, and but one,
    an outer, door, well strengthened by bar holes. Below the springing
    are two small holes, now stopped, for an iron bar, rather low for a
    centring, and possibly connected with a light drawbridge. The door is
    in the centre of the west face, as is the opposite window of the east
    face; but the north window is at the west end of its face, about 3 feet
    from the corner, and the south window is placed diagonal to it at a
    similar distance from the south-east corner. The three windows were all
    of one pattern.</p>

  <p>Besides these openings, there are at the same level three mural
    chambers and a staircase. The principal chamber occupies the south-west
    angle, and is in plan a right angle with two limbs, like the capital
    letter L. That in the west wall is 5 feet 6 inches broad by 14 feet
    long; that in the south wall, 4 feet 10 inches broad by 23 feet long;
    but as each is measured over the breadth of the other, the total length
    of the chamber measured on the outer wall is 37 feet and measured
    along the inner wall only 26 feet 8 inches. The chamber is partly
    lined with chalk ashlar and partly with rubble, and the vault, barrel
    and round-headed, is of rubble. The vault springs from a plain Norman
    abacus. The height to the springing is about 7 feet. The outer wall
    of this chamber has been lined throughout with an arcade, originally
    of ten arches, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> six remain quite perfect, and of most of the
    others there are traces. The arcade is of late Norman work, the piers
    delicate, the caps very highly carved, the arches round-headed. The
    whole is recessed in the wall, reaches to the springing of the vault,
    and rests upon a low plinth or dado. There is a loop in the west wall
    near the north end of the chamber and another in its south end in the
    south wall. There is also a third and longer and lower loop at the
    other end of the south limb, close to, and on the right of, the priest
    as he stood before the altar, the place of which at the east end is
    marked by a bench or step in the wall. One original door was in the
    west limb, close to the main entrance. In King‚Äôs time it was perfect,
    and was round-headed, 2 feet 4 inches wide and 7 feet 7 inches high,
    but it has since been broken away. There is a larger, rude opening in
    the south limb, which may represent the place of another door. That
    this singular and highly-ornate chamber was originally an oratory is
    evident, both from the care bestowed upon it, from the traces of an
    altar in the east wall, and from the window next the altar.</p>

  <p>In Tudor times, the south wall was breached, and a clumsy, flat-topped
    window of three lights inserted, for which much of the arcade has been
    cut away; and a rude wall with a door in it has been built across the
    south limb, probably to convert the oratory into two sleeping places.
    Upon the chalk ashlar of this chamber have been carved a considerable
    number of rude representations, apparently the work of one period.
    Some are simply incised, others carved in relief. There is one very
    evident Crucifixion, with a soldier piercing our Lord‚Äôs side, the
    disciples attending, and something like a veiled female figure about
    to faint. There is also a <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Christopher; a bishop recumbent beneath
    a crown; and other figures, both ecclesiastic and military. They are
    evidently the work of persons confined in this apartment, and as they
    are rude, illiterate, and without any trace of heraldic emblems, they
    are probably the work of common gaol prisoners, and are likely enough
    to be of the beginning of the thirteenth century, when the prison was
    over-crowded and every available space sure to have been employed.
    There was, of course, a larger chapel in the lower ward, not to mention
    the parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, hard by. These carvings have been
    engraved, but not with the necessary correctness. It speaks little for
    the public spirit of Guildford that they are not photographed.</p>

  <p>On the other or north side of the main entrance, also in the west
    wall, is a second mural chamber, entered by a narrow, round-headed,
    original door, 2 feet 4 inches broad by 7 feet 7 inches high, quite
    plain, of ashlar. This chamber has a rude, round-headed barrel vault,
    and is 9 feet 2 inches long by 5 feet 1 inch broad. There is one loop
    in the west wall. The walls are rubble, but the internal jamb of the
    door, being of chalk ashlar, bears some carvings in the style of those
    described above.</p>

  <p>The third chamber is in the north wall, at its east end. Its door and
    much of its inner wall and floor have been removed to allow of the
    insertion of a fireplace and chimney-shaft, but enough remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> to show
    that the chamber was 14 feet long by 3 feet 2 inches broad, and had a
    loop in the north wall. The eastern third of this chamber is uninjured.
    A depression in the floor, quite at the east end, looks as though it
    had been a garderobe for the state floor, and this idea is strengthened
    by the quoining and ashlar-work about the angles at that end. Brayley
    prolongs this chamber at a right angle into the east wall. This is a
    pure fiction. The quoining of the end shows that there was nothing
    further, and the groove in the wall is only meant to support the ends
    of the boards upon which the vault was turned. The fireplace, close
    west of this chamber, of which the flue remains, is an insertion. The
    position of the mural chamber and of the window shows, however, that
    there may have been an original fireplace here.</p>

  <p>There remains to be mentioned the well-stair, which occupies the
    north-west angle of the keep, commencing at the first-floor level and
    ascending to the roof. This stair does not communicate directly with
    the main chamber, but opens by a small, round-headed door in the jamb
    of the adjacent north window, where three steps in a short, narrow
    passage lead up into the base of the well-stair. The stairs are gone,
    but the cylinder of the well-stair, 8 feet diameter, remains. As high
    as the second floor it is lined with excellent chalk ashlar, and
    lighted by two loops on the west side. A door and passage, similar to
    that below, ascends by four steps into a recess, not a window, in the
    north wall of the upper floor. This side door is pointed, but this
    seems the effect of modern cobbling. It should further be mentioned
    that the four hollow angles of the first or state floor are quoined
    with chalk ashlar. The floor rested on no set-off, the walls being of
    the thickness of the basement.</p>

  <p>The second, or upper floor was about 15 feet high. There is a set-off
    at the floor level, reducing the east and west walls by about 2 feet.
    In this floor are four windows in broad recesses. Those on the west
    and east and south faces are central. The fourth window is towards the
    east end of the north wall, the centre of that side being occupied by
    a fireplace much modernised, but which the displacement of the window
    shows to be original. In the south wall, close to the south-east angle,
    a door leads into a small mural garderobe, with two vents corbelled
    out over the exterior wall and a loop above them. With this exception,
    there are no mural chambers on this floor, which is singular, seeing
    that the wall is quite thick enough to carry them. There is, however,
    in the west wall, near its north end, one jamb of a walled-up door,
    which may have been meant to communicate with the stair or with a mural
    chamber. It seems never to have been completed. The four angles of
    this room are quoined in chalk ashlar, as in the room below, and the
    window recesses had, and one still has, round-headed arches. This floor
    is very inaccessible, but was reached by a ladder when these remarks
    upon it were recorded. The walls are evidently, in the main, original,
    though much pulled about by the Carter family when they lived here. The
    recesses also are original, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> the windows themselves are cut-brick
    insertions of two lights, arched.</p>

  <p>It will be observed that the eastern wall, though very thick, is
    pierced by no galleries, and, with the exception of two windows, is
    absolutely solid from base to summit. Probably the object was, by
    placing this mass of firm masonry on the solid ground, to give support
    to the other three sides, and thus prevent them from sliding down the
    slope of the mound, as was the case with some much lighter and later
    buildings in a similar position at Cardiff.</p>

  <p>It has been stated that the keep stands upon the south-eastern slope
    of the mound, consequently there is to the west, and in front of
    its entrance, nearly the whole table summit. This was enclosed by a
    circular wall, like a shell-keep, about 25 feet high, which, springing
    from the south-eastern angle of the keep, seems to have been carried
    round the mound, commencing at about half its height, until it reached
    the north-east angle of the keep, at which junction there seems to have
    been a gateway. Of this circular wall about one-half, either actual or
    in foundations, remains. The fragment of wall, about 5 feet thick and
    20 feet high, is evidently of the date of the keep, the same thin red
    tiles being used in its chalk masonry. Also in this wall is an original
    garderobe, apparently of three stages: one at the ward level, one
    half-way up, and one on the battlements; the three seem to have united
    in a common shaft, the vent of which is seen outside the base of the
    wall.</p>

  <p>The space thus enclosed by the keep and the circular curtain was the
    inner ward. How the main door of the keep was reached does not appear.
    There was not the usual fore-building, as at Norwich or Rochester; the
    circumscribing wall and the lofty position of the keep rendered this
    unnecessary. A row of small holes at the door level may have belonged
    to a sort of timber landing, to be reached by a flight of steps of the
    same material. There is said to have been a well in this ward, about 6
    feet from the west wall of the keep, south of the door.</p>

  <p>There remain two wards to be described. The line of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>
    of the castle seems to have been much as follows: Commencing at the
    angle of Castle Street and Quarry Street, where the site of the present
    ‚ÄúKing‚Äôs Head‚Äù inn was probably marked by a tower, the west front
    took the line of Quarry Street, past the great gateway, to the tower
    containing a postern, which still marks the south-west angle of the
    enclosure. Thence the wall passed east till it reached the boundary
    of the extra-parochial ground, whence, in the line of that boundary,
    it probably took the curve of the counterscarp of the main ditch, in
    the direction of the Bowling Green Cottages. There, on the platform at
    the end of the causeway, was no doubt a barbican covering the direct
    approach to the keep. Thence the wall seems to have been continued
    along the line of the ditch, shown by the curve of Castle Street,
    until it again reached Quarry Street, thus enclosing what corresponds
    tolerably well to the area of the castle at the sale of 1612, which
    is described as 5 acres, 3 roods, 10 perches; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>or nearly six acres.
    Of this area, the part north of the great gateway was shut off by a
    curtain, parts of which remain, and which seems to have run up the
    mound to the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the inner ward. In this, the middle
    ward, stood the hall and principal buildings, as is clear from the
    considerable, though fragmentary, Norman walls still to be seen, two of
    which, forming two sides of a large chamber, are very perfect, and one
    is pierced by a very perfect Norman window recess and loop.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp80" id="i_069">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">GUILDFORD CASTLE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>What stood in the area south of the gateway, into which the postern
    led, is not known. It long contained the gardens of the governor of the
    gaol, when the castle was employed for that ignoble use, and in it is
    the celebrated well connected with the caverns.</p>

  <p>The great gate in Quarry Street, though large, is at present a mere
    opening, perhaps of the age of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, in an older, and probably
    Norman, curtain. Whether it was connected with the gatehouse is
    uncertain, but there is, as already stated, an indication in the
    masonry that such was the case. Also the portcullis groove is large,
    and so heavy a grate could not have been worked without a chamber above
    carrying a winch. Outside the gate are two buttresses, which have a
    late Norman aspect. One is nearly perfect, the other has been replaced
    in brick, but probably upon the old base. The south-west angle of the
    Quarry Street front is marked by the not inconsiderable remains of the
    postern tower, adjacent wall, and a large buttress, all pretty clearly
    late Norman. Towards the north and east the walls are entirely removed,
    but in these quarters the line of the ditch affords a clue to the
    original boundary. The <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> thus laid down measures about
    535 yards; its greatest north and south diameter, 170 yards; and east
    and west, 140 yards. The Quarry Street front is straight and 138 yards
    long, with the gate nearly in the middle. From the postern tower to the
    end of the keep causeway is 213 yards, and thence to the ‚ÄúKing‚Äôs Head‚Äù
    angle, 184 yards.</p>

  <p>Captain James has detected traces of a line of wall parallel to, and
    about 30 yards south of, the High Street, which may not improbably have
    been the boundary of an enclosed area appended to the castle, as may
    the extra-parochial lands on the east and south-east, but the actually
    defended area of the castle seems to have been as above described.</p>

  <p>It may further be observed that Quarry Street, which runs along the
    foot of the west wall of the castle and lay between it and the river,
    seems to have been defended on that side by the low cliff and talus
    already mentioned, supported probably by the retaining wall, of which
    traces and the jamb of a gate remain; while there is a tradition of a
    gate crossing the street near the postern of the castle, which probably
    guarded the approach to the town from the south, the only quarter from
    which a hostile approach would be apprehended.</p>

  <p>Not only are the remains of the domestic buildings of a late Norman
    character, but among the repairs of the hall, in the reign of Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, two of the piers are mentioned as out of the perpendicular, a
    tolerably conclusive evidence that the hall resembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> Oakham and
    Leicester and was of Norman date. Altogether, it is sufficiently
    evident that the whole area of the castle was enclosed by its original
    founder, and is not later than the middle of the twelfth century, the
    detached fragments of walls and buildings being in substance of the
    same date with the keep. The castle is in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs parish, bordered
    on the north-east by Trinity and on the east by the extra-parochial
    plot, the origin of which is not known. Probably the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>
    took in the whole of the residence of the royal Saxon owners.</p>

  <p>Those who have supposed that the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the castle
    extended to the present High Street have regarded the two well-known
    crypts remaining there as proofs of this extent. One of these, on the
    south side, the writer has not been able to visit; but the other,
    exactly opposite the former, and about 160 yards from the keep, he
    has examined, and it is said that the two are of the same age and
    dimensions and very nearly alike.</p>

  <p>The north crypt, beneath the Angel Hotel, is a rectangular chamber,
    31 feet north and south, by 19 feet east and west, and divided into
    two aisles and six bays by two central piers. The piers are plain
    cylinders, 18 inches diameter and 5 feet 6 inches high. The bases are
    now concealed; the piers are without caps and quite plain. The roof is
    vaulted, and 10 feet 3 inches from the floor to the cornice, groined
    and ribbed. The arches are drop and pointed, the ribs chamfered and
    springing from carved corbels in the wall. At the south end of each
    aisle is a window recess, converging and rising to a loop at the street
    level. The entrance is by a narrow drop-arched door, opening from a
    rising passage, vaulted, with hanging ribs. This opens into a small
    chamber, north of, and 4 or 5 feet above, the vault, whence another
    narrow door probably led up to the ground level. The date of the crypt
    seems to be of the thirteenth century, and it is quite clear that it
    never was prolonged southwards towards the other crypt, and was always
    and only lighted, as now, from the street level. In all probability
    this was the cellar of some considerable hostel, situate, as now, in
    the High Street, which, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as
    now, was probably the main thoroughfare of the town.</p>

  <p>In the immediate neighbourhood of the castle, and, indeed, running
    under the southern edge of its <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, are the celebrated
    caverns which have recently been explored, and for the first time
    correctly planned by Capt. James, whose excellent account of them is
    well known. These caverns are excavated in the chalk, which forms a
    cliff south of the town, and from the base of which they are entered.
    The chalk here dips northerly, at about ten degrees, and the hardest
    bed and the most suitable for building purposes lies at the base of
    the cliff and is about 6 or 7 feet thick. This bed has been largely
    quarried by open ‚Äúpatching‚Äù in the broken ground south of the cliff,
    which, indeed, is apparently artificial, and produced by these
    excavations, and it was only when the bed became too deep for that
    mode of working that the quarrymen had recourse to mining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> operations.
    These later works are, in general plan, composed of a gallery parallel
    to, and a few feet within, the face of the cliff, from which, at a
    right angle, eight parallel stalls are carried north-eastwards. The
    extreme points of the excavation are a little over 55 yards north-west
    and south-east, by 32 yards north-east and south-west; but the area
    actually excavated is only about 1,150 yards, and the cubical contents
    about 2,330 yards. The plan alone would show that they were opened
    for quarries. But, besides this, although much solid chalk has been
    removed, the excavation is nearly choked up with the immense quantity
    of ‚Äúsmall‚Äù produced by unskilful working, and through which narrow
    paths are left to get at the face of the work. It is evident that
    this is not <i lang="fr">d√©bris</i> brought in, nor caused by the fall of the
    roof, which is remarkably sound. It is simply broken chalk which has
    been thrown back as the miners proceeded, and remains undisturbed.
    The character and presence of this rubbish not only shows that the
    excavation was a quarry, but that it never was used for anything else,
    neither as a granary, nor a cellar, nor for human habitation, for
    nowhere has it been cleared away so as to set any part of the cavities
    free for such purposes.</p>

  <p>Nearly in the deepest part of the working, about 60 feet below the
    surface, the caverns have been pierced by a well, sunk, it is said, in
    the garden of the governor of the old gaol. This well has been carried
    through the caverns, if to water, probably to a depth of another
    hundred feet, but it has subsequently been covered over with plank,
    at the level of the cavern floor, and so now remains. The pipe of the
    well above is very rugged, as though sunk by unskilled workmen‚Äîperhaps
    convicts,‚Äîand is stained, as though used as a cesspool. Also, for many
    yards around, the rubbish, elsewhere of pure white, is dark and foul,
    as though, failing to reach water, or afterwards disused for that
    purpose, the well had been employed as a receptacle for all the filth
    of the prison.</p>

  <p>As to the age of these quarries, it is not easy to form a sound
    opinion. They have been supposed to be British, and various uses have
    been found for them, quite at variance with the appearances they
    present. The only argument for such an origin has been overlooked. The
    town is in Woking hundred, and Woking, like Wokey in Mendip, may be a
    corruption of the British ‚ÄúOgof‚Äù (fovea), a cave. But Woking was never
    the name of the town, and the material evidence of the caverns does not
    favour this theory. They are certainly not British: the plan of the
    workings excludes this view. No doubt they might be Roman, but there
    are no traces of Roman buildings in the neighbourhood, and chalk, even
    hard chalk, is too plentiful all along the ridge to be carried hence
    to any great distance. The most probable supposition seems to me to be
    that they were opened by the builders of the Norman castle, who used
    chalk largely for their inner, and, indeed, for much of their more
    exposed, work. The quarries have no communication with any part of the
    castle. Where they infringe upon its borders, they are far too deep to
    have been employed against it during a medi√¶val siege.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="HARLECH_CASTLE_MERIONETH">HARLECH CASTLE, MERIONETH.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">DESCRIPTION.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Castle of Harlech occupies a bold and rugged headland of rock
    which juts forward upon the coast-line of Merioneth over the broad
    alluvial plain known as Morfa Harlech, near to its southern and
    narrower extremity. Six centuries back, when the Traeth was an estuary,
    and the waves may have washed the foot of the rock, Harlech, as now
    Criccaieth, was probably accessible by water,‚Äîa circumstance likely
    to have governed its founder in his selection of the site. Although
    scarcely 200 feet above the sea level, and connected with a much higher
    background, the rock of Harlech is nevertheless a very striking object,
    and by the extreme boldness of its outline and its almost isolated
    position does justice to its very significant appellation. It commands
    one of the most remarkable prospects in Britain. Before it is the Bay
    of Caernarvon with its vast sweep of sandy shore, contained on the
    right by Snowdon and its subordinate peaks; whence the high land, after
    rising into the elevations of Carn Madryn, Carn Bodfuan, and Yr Eifl,
    gradually subsides into the Bay of Aberdaron and the Sound and Isle of
    Bardsey. Caernarvon and Conway are fortresses more ornate in character
    and of larger area; but they are not equal to Harlech in natural
    strength and in grandeur of position; nor is, in these respects,
    Beaumaris itself, though placed in the very eye of the Snowdon group,
    by any means its superior.</p>

  <p>Harlech is a concentric castle of the Edwardian type, and of that type
    a simple and excellent example. It is composed of a central four-sided
    ward contained within four lofty curtains, and capped at each angle
    by a drum-tower of three-quarter projection. In the centre of the
    landward or eastern side is the great gatehouse; opposite to which,
    built against the curtain, are the remains of the hall and domestic
    buildings; and contiguous to them, against the north side, is the
    chapel.</p>

  <p>The main or <em>Inner Ward</em>, thus composed and occupied, stands
    within the second or middle ward, which resembles it generally in
    plan, save that the four corners are not symmetrical, one being merely
    rounded, two others capped by more or less of three-quarter bastions,
    and the fourth rounded on one face and fashioned as a bastion on the
    other. In the centre of the south side is a half-round smaller bastion,
    corbelled out from the retaining wall below; and in the centre of the
    north side are two others, also small, between which is the postern
    of this middle ward. In the east face, opposite the great gatehouse,
    are two ‚Äútourelles,‚Äù or round bartizan turrets, corbelled out from the
    wall; and parts of a small low gatehouse, which contained the outer
    gate.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

  <p>This middle ward is narrow and of unequal breadth, varying from 8 feet
    to 30 feet. It is rather below the level of the inner ward, and the
    ground outside it is from 10 feet to 15 feet lower still; and its walls
    are revetments crested with a parapet which seems to have ranged from
    6 feet to 12 feet in height; in the latter case having a rampart-walk
    reached by open steps. The several bastions seem to have risen a little
    higher than the parapet, and to have contained each a low chamber,
    probably with a flat roof. This ward is protected on the east and south
    sides by a broad and deep dry ditch, quarried in the rock, and running
    out until it ends on the cliff. The other two sides are covered by an
    outer ward of considerable breadth, but composed for the most part of
    steep slopes and abrupt ledges of rock. A part of this ward towards
    the west or sea front contains a long passage which ascends by a lower
    traverse from a water-gate at the foot of the rock, resting partly upon
    a shelf of rock, and which by a second and upper traverse reaches the
    postern of the middle ward.</p>

  <p>Passing into details, the court of the inner ward is about 164 feet
    north and south, by 132 feet east and west. The opposite sides are not
    quite equal, nor are its angles right angles, though nearly so. The
    curtains are about 40 feet high; that to the west is 10 feet thick, the
    others are 11 feet. The parapet was 3 feet thick, and the rear wall 2
    feet, leaving 5 feet to 6 feet for the walk. The two western towers
    are circular, and 34 feet diameter, having three-fourths of their
    circumference exposed outside. Within, the gorge wall fills up the
    angle of meeting of the curtains and contains the entrance-door. The
    basement chamber is below the inner ward level and circular. The first
    floor, at the ward level, is polygonal, as are the two upper floors.
    None are vaulted, and the basement has neither loops nor stairs of
    access. Each of these two towers has a well-stair at its junction with
    the western curtain, lighted by five loops placed one over the other
    in the hollow angle between the tower and the curtain, outside. The
    stairs ascend 20 feet above the tower, in a round turret, battlemented
    on small corbels. Each turret has a door upon the tower roof. The
    staircases commence at the first floor, on or level with the inner
    ward, and open on each floor, but not upon the ramparts of the curtain.
    The upper floor has fireplaces with hoods.</p>

  <p>Outside, these towers rise from the ground without slope or cordon; two
    string-courses, however, mark the level of the two upper floors. The
    stairs are broken away, and the upper rooms inaccessible; but certain
    exterior loops show the existence of two tiers of small chambers (no
    doubt garderobes) in the north and south curtains, where they join the
    towers. Moreover, on the outside of each of these curtains, next to the
    tower, is a broad, flat buttress, thrown out to give space and support
    to these chambers and to contain the sewer-shaft from them. On the
    north wall, the buttress is of good ashlar of the age of the tower. On
    the south wall, it is of rude, inferior work, as though an addition. It
    may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> been rebuilt. In the north curtain there seems to be a third
    chamber at a lower level. The drain here is not seen; on the south face
    it is open. Where these towers meet the rampart-walk they block it up;
    a sort of gallery is, therefore, thrown out on corbels, across the
    angle, and thus, as at Conway, the rampart-walk is carried on.</p>

  <p>The two eastern towers resemble the others in general features and
    dimensions, but differ in details. Their basements have one loop
    towards the middle ward, and their first floor, at the inner ward
    level, is an irregular pentagon in plan, one angle being square. The
    doors are in the gorge wall, but do not lead direct into the tower,
    only into the staircase. In the south-east tower, a stair ascends
    in the northern wall, curving with it, and forks, the right branch
    leading to the second floor of the tower, from which alone, by a trap
    and descending ladder, the first floor and basement were accessible.
    This floor, like all the rest, was of timber, and from it, on the west
    side, a second stair commences, and curving with the wall, and having
    a small garderobe by the way, ascends to the ramparts of the south
    curtain. Reverting to the lower stair, the branch to the left opens
    upon the inner face of the east curtain, and ascends by a narrow, open
    stair, supported on corbels, across the gorge wall of the tower, and
    up the inner face of the south curtain to its ramparts. The roof and
    ramparts of the tower are reached by an exterior stair from the rampart
    of the east curtain. A loop in the hollow between the junction of this
    tower with the south curtain marks the place of the garderobe already
    mentioned. Above it was a second upon the battlements of the tower,
    and at the base of the wall is a large flat-topped sewer descending
    from the two. The south-east tower bears the name of Mortimer, the
    south-west that of Bronwen, the fair-bosomed, sister of Br√¢n the
    Blessed.</p>

  <p>The north-east, the debtors‚Äô or armourers‚Äô, tower has a door in
    the gorge opening on the left upon a well-stair, 8 feet diameter,
    which ascends to the second floor only, from which the first floor
    and basement were reached by a trap and ladder. The second floor is
    seven-sided, those below cylindrical. As in the south-east tower, an
    independent stair led from the second floor to the ramparts of the
    curtain, and upon this curved stair is a garderobe, the loop of which
    is seen at the junction of the tower with the north curtain, and the
    mouth or vent at the ground level. The roof of this tower, like the
    other, is reached from the walls by an external stair. These two
    towers, having no well-stairs to the roof, have no subordinate turrets.
    That all these four towers had flat roofs is pretty clear from the
    position of two corbels in each, evidently intended to carry hammer
    beams or struts to the one main beam which crossed the aperture, and
    was thus rendered capable of carrying great weight.</p>

  <p>The great gatehouse is 80 feet broad and 54 feet deep, besides which
    it has two half-round projections in the front and two three-quarter
    projecting stair-turrets 24 feet diameter at the outer angles of the
    rear, the former flanking the entrance, the latter communicating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
    with each floor and the ramparts. The entrance passage, 54 feet
    long by 8 feet broad, is much mutilated, but seems to have had an
    exterior drawbridge, two grates, folding doors, and a grate at the
    inner front. The entrance portal has within it a ‚Äúmachecoule,‚Äù or
    <i lang="fr">meurtri√®re</i>,‚Äîthat is, an opening from the chamber above‚Äîand
    behind this a portcullis. Then follows a passage 11 feet long, crossed
    by two ribs, a second portcullis, and a portal arch, upon which rests
    the west wall of the chapel. Then follows another passage, 20 feet
    long, entered by gates opening towards the inner ward, and crossed by
    five broad ribs, with four open spaces. At the end of this is a third
    portcullis, the groove for which is now closed above at a level too
    low to allow the grate to be lifted to the height of a cart, while in
    the arch above is a square cavity or ‚Äúmachecoule.‚Äù It would seem that
    while the wall was rising it was decided not to use these grooves, and
    that the hole was intended to take the place of the grate as a defence.
    Beyond this is the inner portal, which, like the outer, has no rebate
    for a door. In the front division of this long entrance, between the
    two outer grates, are two loops from the side lodges, which are entered
    by two doors placed near to the inner end. This passage was covered
    over with boards, the flooring of the rooms above, and which rested
    upon the stone ribs. Here, as is often the case, the portcullis groove
    stops from 1 foot to 18 inches above the door sill, showing that the
    spikes at the lower end of the grate were of this length. This long
    entrance passage is further lengthened by the addition of two unequal
    piers to its internal face. They are blocks of masonry 10 feet thick.
    That on the south or left had a door whence a narrow staircase of two
    flights ascended to the front floor. The pier on the right is of less
    breadth, and was only an abutment to support the arch which connected
    the two and contained and continued the entrance passage, and on which
    was the landing at the stair-head.</p>

  <p>The basement of the gatehouse is at the ground level. On each side of
    the passage are two chambers, those in front occupying the half-round
    projection and looped to the field. They are entered from the chambers
    in the rear, which are rectangular, having shoulder-headed doors
    from the passage and into the well-stairs. The northern chamber
    has a fireplace in the south-east angle. The two southern chambers
    communicate through a large arch, the northern through a doorway only.
    There are also two upper floors, divided as these below, and reached
    by the two large well-stairs. There are spacious and handsome rooms,
    two on each floor, with large windows of two lights in the western or
    larger rooms, and in all are fireplaces with stone hoods. The eastern
    rooms below are half circles in plan; and above, are polygonal. Between
    the lateral rooms and over the entrance passage are two narrow chambers
    unequally divided by a cross wall. The eastern is an oratory, with a
    small, pointed east window over the entrance gate of the castle, and
    near it, in the south wall, is a piscina, which is in the cill of a
    small window opening into a small mural chamber, a vestry. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> is a
    similar chamber, but without the window, in the north wall. Both rooms
    are entered from the oratory. As at York, Chepstow, and elsewhere,
    this oratory served also as a portcullis chamber, and the floor was
    of wood, with traps to allow the passage of the grates when lifted.
    The grates were suspended from the vault above, as is still seen. The
    other and larger chamber, placed over the western part of the passage,
    had also a wooden floor. It had a west window of two lights over the
    inner portal, and north of this a round-headed doorway. The portcullis,
    if lifted, would have blocked this entrance, and therefore when the
    door was opened it was stopped. The machecoule is seen in the window
    seat. The upper chambers are not accessible, but they seem similar to
    those below, and there is a second oratory above the first, with a
    smaller east window‚Äîa very unusual arrangement. This floor communicates
    laterally with the ramparts of the curtain, and at the junction on each
    side is a mural garderobe. On the south side a mural stair descends
    to two chambers at different levels, both in the curtain wall. On
    the north side the arrangement is rather different. There, the mural
    garderobes are supported in part by a projection at the first-floor
    level, corbelled out in the angle between the gatehouse and the
    curtain, outside, and the vent was probably between the corbels. Above,
    at the rampart level, half the thickness of the wall is occupied by a
    garderobe chamber, of which the side is broken down. Several of the
    chimney shafts are collected in a central group, each shaft having a
    bold capital with a plain roll moulding.</p>

  <p>The domestic buildings were placed against the curtain on the west
    side of the inner ward. The kitchen is thought to have been at the
    north end, including within its limits the basement of the north-west
    tower. It is, however, more probable that this was the withdrawing
    room, placed between the hall and the chapel. A gloomy corner, no
    doubt, but the state rooms were evidently in the gatehouse. The kitchen
    would scarcely have been designed originally between the hall and the
    chapel. The cross wall, still standing, but which looks either modern
    or rebuilt, formed the north end of the hall, and the recesses in the
    west wall of the curtain carried the hammer beams of its open roof. In
    this wall are the remains of a large fireplace, of which the hood is
    gone, and the lower part has recently been rebuilt. On either side are
    the broken apertures for two windows, and in the wall, near its south
    end, a segmental-headed door, now walled up, but evidently a postern.
    There are also near this two small windows, one of which seems to have
    lighted the gallery and the other the space below it. Of the position
    of the gallery there can be no doubt, but the wall behind it, forming
    the south end of the hall, and now removed, had no bond either into
    the curtain or into the east wall. Most of this east wall, the inner
    wall of the hall, is gone. The hall was 30 feet broad. The roof seems
    to have been lofty, and part of the weather moulding of its gutter
    remains along the west wall. On the floor, in the north-west corner of
    the hall, has been built a large oven of stone, the lining of which
    is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> much burnt. It probably was inserted when the castle was used as a
    prison.</p>

  <p>South of the hall is a considerable space extending to the gorge wall
    of Bronwen Tower, and in the east wall of this space are remains of
    a door and two windows. It is probable that the kitchen was here,
    in the rear of the gallery, and that a row of corbels outside the
    east wall carried a lean-to building attached to it and near this;
    against the south wall is a rectangular pit, the underground storey of
    some building now removed. If the kitchen was at this end, the hall
    fireplace was a little below the dais, a very probable position.</p>

  <p>The chapel, a later building, was placed against the north wall. Its
    east wall and pointed window remain. The south wall is gone. In the
    centre of the north curtain is a segmental-arched doorway, evidently
    a postern, and nearly opposite to that of the middle ward. It is much
    mutilated, and does not seem to have had a portcullis. The wall east
    of it is pierced by three loops, 4 feet above the ground level. There
    was at least one loop westward of the postern. The well was in the
    north-east angle of the court. It has recently been opened a few feet
    down.</p>

  <p>The <em>Middle Ward</em> contains little of interest. On the north side
    it is 15 feet broad, and hence, between its two roundels, 10 feet
    apart, opened the postern, 8 feet wide, now walled up. On the west
    front, the ward is 27 feet broad and forms a noble terrace overlooking
    the sea and commanding the approach from the water-gate. The hall had
    windows looking this way, and upon it opened the hall postern. Towards
    the south end a few steps descended about 10 feet into the south-west
    bastion. Probably there was a cross wall here with a doorway. Turning
    the south-west corner, the ground again rises to a door in a wall which
    crosses the south terrace near its west end. This side of the wall
    has a central half-round bastion, the broken parapet of which shows
    traces of a loop and of a garderobe. On the remaining or eastern side
    is the great entrance. Here the gateway, which crowns a low salient, is
    flanked by two roundels. The portal is broken down, and it does not now
    appear how this was connected with the inner gatehouse. Probably the
    short distance between the two was arched over and had lateral doorways
    into the middle ward. From the inner gate, twenty steps descended to
    the bridge, so that no horse or carriage could have entered this way.</p>

  <p>The defences beyond the middle ward are the ditch, the outer ward, and
    the water-gates and passage. The ditch covers only the east and south,
    the two landward sides. It is quarried in the rock, and is about 60
    feet broad and was 20 feet deep, with vertical sides. Its scarp is the
    revetment wall of the middle ward, and the counterscarp, where the
    rock was broken, is also lined with masonry. The ditch runs out at
    either end upon the shelving face of the rock. Across it, to the main
    entrance, led a bridge upon which it is said there were two openings
    with drawbridges. The whole is now a solid causeway.</p>

  <p>Although the castle stands upon a promontory of rock, there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
    broken shelving space between its wall and an actual cliff in which the
    rock terminates below, and it is this space, which lies to the west
    and north, which has been enclosed as the outer ward, the containing
    wall of which crowns the cliff and where necessary is supported by a
    revetment. This outer wall begins below the north-east bastion of the
    middle ward, whence a door with steps seems to have led down about 10
    feet to its ramparts. It is at that point a very stout wall, about
    14 feet high, with a parapet on the western face, thus defending the
    ditch and main bridge from an enemy who might be in possession of the
    outer ward and be disposed to turn the eastern flank. It is probable,
    however, that the wall had a double parapet, for lower down, where the
    wall faces the north, the parapet is on that face. Near the bastion
    there seems to have been a door in this wall, giving a passage from
    the outer ward to the ditch. Lower down, where the wall stands on the
    cliff, it is thinner, and in parts much broken away. Still lower it
    is more perfect and much stronger, and where it turns the north-west
    corner of the rock, opposite the railway station, it is of great
    thickness, and has a rampart wall and parapet towards the sea, above
    the level of which it is about 30 feet; near this point is the lower
    water-gate, a regular postern, in a small rectangular shoulder in the
    wall. A roadway of about 5 yards or 6 yards long, cut in the rock,
    rises from the marsh 10 feet or 12 feet, and upon it, in front of
    the portal, was a drawbridge with a pit 12 feet deep, and within the
    portal a short shoulder-headed passage closed apparently by a door,
    but without any portcullis. Beyond this a flight of open stairs niched
    in the curtain ascended to an embattled platform over the gate. From
    the lower gate, the road leads up a rather steep passage formed partly
    by taking advantage of a shelf and partly by quarrying the rock, the
    outer side being protected by a wall 8 to 10 feet high and from 2 to
    3 feet thick, and looped at about every 20 feet. As the inner side
    of the roadway is the irregular face of the cliff, it varies much in
    breadth, from 6 to 12 feet or more. This road, continually ascending,
    thus covers the whole seaward face of the castle rock, and at about 70
    feet or 80 feet in height it terminates in the middle gate, which is
    about 20 feet below the base of the south-western bastion of the middle
    ward. Here, a shoulder in the rock is occupied by a second gatehouse,
    fortified as the first, with a drawbridge and a deep pit, which below
    has two arches, one for the discharge of water from the pit and the
    other, which may be merely to support the side wall of the gatehouse,
    but which may also be a sewer from the castle. Outside this gate is a
    platform which rakes the face of the wall of the passage below, while
    above and within the gate is a broad bastion, whence commences the
    second traverse. At this point, the end of the main ditch lies just
    below the bastion wall, and was reached from it by a small door and
    some steps, now gone.</p>

  <p>The road now makes a complete turn, and commences a new traverse which
    rises much more gently than that below. When abreast of the mid-front
    of the castle it is supported by a retaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> wall and two small square
    buttresses or buttress turrets, traces of which are seen upon a ledge
    of rock. Passing these, where the road comes opposite to the north-west
    bastion of the middle ward, it was crossed by a wall and doorway, of
    which traces remain, which divided the outer ward into two parts. Above
    this, the way turned eastward and ascended to the centre of the north
    front, where it reached the postern of the middle ward and there ended.</p>

  <p>These are the whole of the works proper to the castle, but a few yards
    to the north of the rock a steep road has been cut by which men and
    horses could be led up from the castle landing-place to the village
    without entering the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, though commanded from it.</p>

  <p>No one acquainted with Caerphilly can visit Harlech without observing
    the close resemblance between the two castles, so far as regards the
    plan of the interior and middle wards. The court, rectangular, or
    nearly so, the absence of a keep, the drum-towers capping the four
    angles, the general character of the gatehouse and its position in the
    centre of one side, and the domestic buildings placed against the wall
    of the inner court, are peculiarities common to both. In each also
    the gatehouse is the grand feature of the building. Further, there is
    to be observed in both the excessive narrowness of the middle ward,
    its revetment rendering more than a parapet unnecessary, its slender
    and subordinate gatehouse, and its lateral postern opening direct
    through both wards. As Harlech did not need the outworks and exterior
    gate of Caerphilly, nor Caerphilly the water-gate of Harlech, here
    the resemblance ceases, but it is such as to justify the conclusion
    that Henry of Elfreton, who was the architect of Harlech, had studied
    Caerphilly, if indeed he was not also its architect.</p>

  <p>The defences of Harlech seem calculated for protection against a
    surprise by the Welsh, who were probably as active as they were
    fearless. Hence the very lofty curtains, the long entrance bridge, the
    ascending steps to the main entrance, and the dimensions of the middle
    ward, too narrow to allow any considerable body of men to effect a
    lodgment there for an attack upon the inner ward, and the water-gates
    and covered way, in the construction of which the natural strength
    of the rock was enhanced by the occupation of its various points of
    vantage. Whether in the reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> Morfa Harlech was more than
    a marsh is a question for a geologist to solve; but either by the
    shallow sea or by a canal cut across the low ground, it seems certain
    that in planning the castle Edward counted upon the means of reaching
    it by a quarter quite independent of the Welsh.</p>

  <p>Although the general plan of Harlech is evidently the work of one mind
    and its execution generally of one date, there are some appearances
    in the work which show that alterations and additions were introduced
    affecting, not the general plan, but certain of its parts. It is
    evident that parts of the curtain have been thickened about 2 feet,‚Äîthe
    north and south walls by additions inside; the west, on the outside.
    Also this thickening seems to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> decided upon when the walls
    were 30 feet high, as above that level they are of one mass and date.
    The exterior stair on the inner face of the great gatehouse was
    also an afterthought, and the doorway at its head clearly was not
    originally introduced. Besides this, the six windows on that front of
    the gatehouse, in the two upper floors, have been reduced in height by
    the insertion of a segmental arch between 2 feet and 3 feet below the
    original head; but the pattern is the same, and the masonry filling up
    the space seems of the date of the window, or very nearly so. These
    windows are of a peculiar pattern. Their two lights are trefoiled; and
    in the spandrels are also trefoils pierced. The mouldings are concave;
    and one is a small hollow, as in the early Perpendicular style. They
    must, however, be original.</p>

  <p>The inference from these alterations seems to be, that Edward visited
    the castle when the works were far advanced, and the hall, gatehouse,
    and the lower part of the north, south, and west curtains built. The
    gatehouse curtain was probably always intended to be of its present
    height, as at Caerphilly. He ordered the other three curtains to be
    thickened and raised to the full height of the gatehouse curtain;
    to obey which order, the thickening was applied where possible on
    the inside, but where the hall prevented this, on the outside. The
    upper part of the walls so raised would, of course, be of one date,
    and solid. At the same time it was decided to make the rooms of the
    upper floors of the gatehouse those of state; and as the ways up the
    well-staircases were not thought suitable, a new and more direct
    staircase was built and a new door opened in the wall. The chapel in
    the inner ward seems a still later addition.</p>

  <p>The character of the masonry throughout is exceedingly rough, as though
    hastily executed. It is rubble, and some of it very poor rubble indeed.
    The towers are of far better work than the curtains. The stones are
    larger, and their interstices filled in with more care. The ashlar
    is very good, but is sparingly used, and confined to the dressings,
    window-cases, chimney-hoods and heads, and a few of the more important
    doorways. The ordinary doors are mere openings to the walls, without
    rebates or chamfer, with shouldered heads of a rude character; and the
    sewer-openings, seen under the garderobes, have merely long stones for
    lintels. The masonry of the covered way and water-gates is also very
    inferior, and much of the side wall has, in consequence, slipped away
    from the rock.</p>

  <p>The turret-heads of the gatehouse and two western towers have parapets
    projecting upon a corbel-table about 6 inches. There are no traces of
    holes for brattices; but upon the exterior of these two towers the
    putlog-holes are arranged in a spiral ascending form, east to north.
    In the north-west tower, on its east face, at the height of the old
    curtain, is a row of round holes about a foot apart, and from this
    level the spiral commences. It is pretty clear that having built the
    curtain, the masons here threw out a platform, and that the spiral
    round, by which the materials were raised for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> upper part of the
    tower, began here. The tower of Coucy was scaffolded in the same way.
    There is throughout the building a remarkable absence of vaulting. It
    was confined to the oratory and to parts of the entrance passage.</p>

  <p>The bird‚Äôs-eye view here given is taken from the east or landward
    side, and shows the entrance, with its great gatehouse, here, as at
    Caerphilly, seen to cross and close the narrow outer ward. The northern
    postern is also shown.</p>

  <p>The castle seems to have escaped the usual dismantling that followed
    upon the civil wars, and no part has been blown up. It has, however,
    been freely used as a quarry by the people around; and, with its
    iron and timber, much of its ashlar has been rudely detached and
    stolen. There is but little evidence of any material addition to, or
    alteration in, the work of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, which is singular, seeing that
    the place was long the seat of an assize, and the judges lodged here.
    It was then also a prison, and the windows were heavily barred, the
    bars forming shallow cages in front of the windows, as in some of the
    Italian palaces. Any later work introduced for the judicial or prison
    arrangements has either fallen down or been removed. The quarry whence
    the castle was built is pointed out on the hill-side, a short distance
    to the south-east. Although the present castle certainly is not older
    than the reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, probably about 1280, the Welsh claim to
    have been the founders of an older fortress on the same spot, called
    by them Caer Gollwyn, from Collwyn ab Tangno, a Welsh chief who lived
    <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 877. Possibly a spot so inviting might have been occupied
    by a camp; but all that is now seen, whether of earthwork or masonry,
    is evidently not older than the thirteenth century. In 1404 the castle
    is said to have been taken by Owen Glyndwr; and Margaret of Anjou was
    sheltered here in 1460, in memory of which event the south-east tower
    for some time bore her name. There does not seem to be any detailed
    account of the siege of 1468, when the governor was Dafydd ab Ievan ab
    Einion, the same who had received Queen Margaret, and whose boast it
    was, that as he had held a castle in France till all the old women in
    Wales had heard of it, so he would hold his Welsh trust till it had
    become equally well known in France. He seems to have redeemed his
    pledge by standing a long siege, and yielding at last, on honourable
    terms, to Sir Richard Herbert, the commander for Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> Harlech
    was held for Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and surrendered on articles to General Mytton
    in 1647. The borough seal represents a castle triple towered, but the
    design is evidently conventional. The first constable was Hugh de
    Wonkeslow, appointed about 1283 by Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>; the last was the late
    W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., of Peniarth, as good a man as he was an eminent
    antiquary.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="HASTINGS_CASTLE_SUSSEX">HASTINGS CASTLE, SUSSEX.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Rape of Hastings is the most eastern of the six divisions of
    the county of Sussex which are supposed to derive their somewhat
    peculiar name from the early occupation of the district by emigrants
    from Jutland. The Rape of Hastings, probably, is so called from its
    principal town, which was also the seat of its lords both before and
    after the Norman Conquest. Like the other rapes, it had its river and
    its forest, its castle and its castelry, often designated as an Honour.
    The river, the Rother, is the common boundary of Kent and Sussex,
    and joins the sea at Rye. The forest, long since disafforested and
    enclosed, is represented by frequent patches of woodland, scattered
    over the least fertile parts of the district, and by the numerous
    and well-timbered parks by which it is characterised. The town once
    possessed a small port, now silted up. It was situate at the mouth of a
    stream, which still brings down its inconsiderable tribute, flowing at
    the foot and to the west of the castle hill.</p>

  <p>The origin and etymology of the name of Hastings are lost in obscurity.
    It is so uncommon, that it has been supposed to come from Haesten,
    the celebrated pirate and Danish Viking, who infested the southern
    coasts of England and the valley of the Seine in the ninth century,‚Äîa
    period when warriors of Northern descent gave their names to their
    possessions, instead of, like their descendants of two centuries later,
    reversing the practice. Mr. Lower, familiar with Sussex topography,
    has suggested that the small stream of the Asten, a few miles west of
    Hastings, may play some part in its etymology, and that Hasting, or the
    Haesten-Ceaster of the English, may have stood upon its margin. It has
    also been regarded as the seat of the Hastinges, a tribe said to have
    been warred upon by Offa of Mercia in 792. Another not less interesting
    point connected with the place is the fact that it gave name to the
    ancient family who long ago bore the title of Pembroke, and still bear
    that of Huntingdon.</p>

  <p>The castle occupies the narrow, acute, and very steep extremity of a
    ridge of the Wealden formation, which here terminates abruptly to the
    seaward at a height of about 180 feet above the seashore, and seems
    intended by nature for a defensive position. The ridge is a spur from a
    range of larger and more elevated character which extends from the high
    ground of Battle, by Ore, south-eastwards to the sea, and has to its
    west and south a large tract of broken and highly-fertile picturesque
    land known as the hop garden of Sussex, and within which are the
    well-known seats of Hurstmonceaux, Ashburnham, Battle, and Crowhurst,‚Äîa
    tract which presents to the sea an open frontier of about twenty-two
    miles from Hastings to the marsh of Pevensey, defended anciently by
    the two castles of those names, and more recently by twenty or thirty
    martello towers, in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>which our fathers, three quarters of a century
    ago, placed an expensive confidence.</p>

  <p>The ridge and promontory of Hastings remain unencumbered by modern
    buildings, and are occupied only by the castle and its outworks. The
    older part of the town, with its two parish churches of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement
    and All Saints, occupies a deep valley to the east of the castle,
    while round the nose of the rock the remains of the old port have been
    superseded by the new town, a fashionable watering-place. Much of this
    town stands within the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Castro, the parish church
    having been the chapel of the castle, and collegiate. The town seems
    to have been partially walled, and certainly had four gates. Hastings,
    though now affording no accommodation for shipping, is still a cinque
    port, and its ancient consideration is attested by the fact that in
    1229, Seaford, Pevensey, Bulverhythe, Hidney, Iham, Beaksbourne,
    Greenhythe, and Northeye, were its subordinate members, and <i lang="la">tamquam
    membra</i> were Rye and Winchelsea.</p>

  <p>The castle is composed of two wards, separated by a formidable ditch
    cut through the sandstone rock about 400 feet, across the ridge, with
    a breadth of 60 feet, and to a depth of 30 to 40 feet. The inner
    ward lies to the west of this ditch, between it and the point of the
    promontory. The outer ward lies to the east, and is again protected
    by an outer and considerable, though less clearly-defined, ditch of
    greater length than the former, and also crossing the ridge. There
    was also another ditch cut as a sort of step in the steep northern
    slope, and covering that side of the place, and chiefly intended for
    the defences of the inner ward. Between the east end of this ditch and
    the north end of the great cross ditch was the original entrance to
    the inner ward, the approach to which wound up the steep north-western
    slope of the rock.</p>

  <p>The <em>Inner Ward</em> is in figure nearly a right-angled triangle,
    containing about 1¬Ω acres, the north side 154 yards, and the east side
    87 yards in length, while the hypothenuse curves inwards, reducing the
    breadth of the ward at one point to 16 yards. The cliff which forms the
    boundary has been either scarped or has fallen away, so that it is at
    present precipitous, and its face has been patched with modern masonry
    and brickwork. It is said that this side was once straight, and has
    been cut away to make room for the gasworks and a crescent of houses
    below, so as to diminish the castle area. This may be so, but the
    encroachment cannot have been considerable. A wall for defence on this
    front could never have been needed: probably it was only a low parapet.</p>

  <p>Along the north front the ground, though very steep, is not absolutely
    precipitous, and along the crest of the slope are the remains of the
    curtain wall, about 6 feet to 9 feet thick, and in parts 20 to 30 feet
    high. Upon this wall is a rectangular tower, about 12 feet by 20 feet,
    having a ground and upper floors in which are parts of three windows
    of Norman date. Connected with this tower are said to be traces of a
    small postern, and there is certainly a mural passage, 18 feet long,
    ending in a garderobe. East of this tower is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> a turret, square at the
    base, but which above seems to have been cylindrical. It contains a
    well-stair connected with the chapel. The wall is continued round
    the east front across to the cliff. At the angle it is still 20 feet
    to 25 feet high, but further on it has been reduced to 10 feet. In
    this front, overlooking the ditch, are the bases of three half-round
    buttress towers, 20 feet diameter. Their ground floors have been
    vaulted; all above is removed. Between the two most northern of these
    are still to be seen the jambs of an Edwardian gateway, of 9 feet
    opening, with a square portcullis groove, and rebates for a door
    immediately behind it. In this part of the curtain are the remains of
    some mural cells. The gateway must have communicated with the outer
    ward by a bridge across the ditch, probably of timber, since there is
    no trace of masonry in the rock. This entrance is now disused, and the
    entrance in use is in the north side between the chapel tower and the
    north-east angle, protected by a late tower, about 20 feet square with
    very slight walls and a flanking wall, also slight, and projecting
    about 20 feet. This is thought to have been the original gateway of the
    ward, and may have been so, though the other entrance between the two
    flanking half-round towers has at present more the aspect of a main
    entrance.</p>

  <p>The eastern, naturally the weakest side of the inner ward is further
    defended by a broad, artificial bank or ramp of earth from 20 feet to
    30 feet broad and 8 feet to 10 feet high, piled up against the back
    of the wall, which, in fact, is a revetment. At the north-east angle
    of the ward this bank is expanded into a mound about 20 feet high
    above the inner area. The curtain traverses this mound, of which about
    two-thirds is within its circuit.</p>

  <p>No doubt this mound was the keep of the English fortress, and the bank
    and ditch its main landward defences, but, save the curtain, there is
    no trace of any masonry upon it, nor does the Norman castle appear to
    have been provided with any regular keep, either shell or rectangular.
    Probably, as at Exeter, the whole inner ward was the keep.</p>

  <p>There are at present no traces of a hall, kitchen, or regular lodgings
    within the castle, but placed against the north wall are the remains
    of the chapel, or rather of the free collegiate church, composed of a
    nave and chancel. The nave was 30 feet by 64 feet, the curtain forming
    the north wall. There seem to have been a west door and one, or perhaps
    two, south doors. At its east end a handsome highly-pointed arch opened
    into the chancel, and still remains very perfect. The jambs are square,
    the angles replaced by delicate shafts, a quarter engaged, with caps
    and bases of Norman type. The abacus is part of a moulded string, and
    the arch, though the section is square, as in the Norman style, is
    richly moulded. The central member of the arch is a bold rib, springing
    from two brackets or corbels carved in foliage. The general character
    of the whole is very late Norman, passing into early English. In the
    north wall, at its east end, are the remains of the arches of three
    sedilia, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> near the middle of the wall, in a sort of buttress, is a
    piscina, probably a perpendicular insertion. Near the north-west angle
    is the cylindrical base of the font. In the east wall, on each side
    of the chancel arch, is a flat-topped doorway of rude workmanship, as
    though intended to be concealed by hangings. The northern door opens
    into the well-stair of the turret, the southern into a vestry.</p>

  <p>The chancel was about 18 feet broad by 28 feet long. Of its walls only
    a few traces remain. It communicated on the north side with a small
    chamber, perhaps a garderobe, and on the south side with the vestry.
    The vestry, called also the chapter-house, is a small, nearly square
    chamber, 12 feet by 15 feet, with a plain Norman recess in its east
    wall, and the jambs of a door, evidently Norman, opening into what
    seems to have been a sort of lean-to cloister resting on the south
    wall of the nave. The cloister itself is gone; but in the nave wall
    are traces of an arcade. Here are three graves inclosed in pieces of
    stone placed edgeways, and a much worn <i lang="fr">dos-d‚Äô√¢ne</i> coffin-lid.
    The breadth of the nave is wide for a single span, but if there were
    aisles, there must have been two, the arches being central, and in
    that case very narrow ones, even for a Norman church. The floor of the
    chancel is three steps above that of the nave.</p>

  <p>The curtain wall along the north front and over the mound is apparently
    of Norman date, as is most of the east wall; but its buttress-towers
    and the gateway are probably insertions of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or
    Edward. The chapel may be later than the north wall, probably of the
    reign of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> or John.</p>

  <p>The old part of the masonry is coursed rubble, with occasional
    pebble-stones, faced with bold, open-jointed ashlar, the blocks being
    rudely dressed. In one part, near the church, is a little herring-bone
    work, though probably not older than, if so old as, the rest. The
    quoins and window-dressings, where preserved, are good ashlar. Various
    fragments of cut stone are collected and heaped up; of these, a few are
    late Norman, some good early English, some Perpendicular. A late Norman
    crypt has been discovered in the town.</p>

  <p>It may be doubted whether William or his feudatories, the Earl of Eu or
    de Tiliol, added defences in masonry to the works already existing. At
    least, there is no evidence that they did so, and the oldest masonry
    now seen is certainly not very early Norman, though too early to
    have allowed time for the decay of any previous masonry of the same
    architectural period.</p>

  <p>The chapel was probably founded in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and though
    the castle was erected, and for some time held, under the Crown, by the
    powerful Earls of Eu, it was never a great baronial residence, being
    in that respect far inferior to Arundel or Lewes, but was probably
    maintained only as a strong, though small, post to cover embarkations
    for, or disembarkations from, Normandy.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em> is contained between the inner and outer lines of
    ditch; within the latter is a considerable bank of earth, which rises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
    at the north-east angle and is continued across the northern end, that
    being naturally the weakest part of the inclosure. It does not appear
    where was the entrance of this ward, but possibly near the south-east
    angle. There are no traces of masonry here, so that the defences of the
    outer ward may have been a stockade only.</p>

  <p>From the position of this fortress, it is most probable that, like
    Dover, it may originally have been a British work, the entrenchments,
    including the promontory and the south ditches, being the defences
    landward. The mound, however, placed at an angle of the inner ward,
    upon the bank, and covering the approach, is almost certainly a later,
    and no doubt an English, work.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the origin of Hastings as a defensive work, its known
    history commences towards the end of the sixth and the beginning of
    the eighth centuries in the times of Offa and Athelstane, when it was
    a place of some consequence, and contained a mint. Coins, indeed, were
    minted here as late as the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p>The termination ‚Äúceaster,‚Äù which it then bore, shows it to have been
    fortified. Towards the middle of the eleventh century it was plundered
    by the Danes, and towards the middle of that century it was the men of
    Hastings who, after the murder of Beorn by Swegen, captured his ships
    and slew his accomplices in the murder, though Swegen himself escaped.
    Hastings also played a part in the Norman Conquest, though not that
    popularly assigned to it as the scene of the battle. William landed
    at Pevensey, and thence moved rapidly to Hastings in search of food.
    There Odo of Bayeux, as one of his lieutenants, ordered a fortress
    to be thrown up, ‚Äú<span lang="fr">ut foderetur castellum</span>,‚Äù and thence, according to
    the same authority, the Bayeux tapestry, William marched against
    Harold. William, we are told, on reaching the port, selected a proper
    site, and fortified it rapidly with a castle in timber, ‚Äú<span lang="la">ligneum
    castellum</span>.‚Äù This, we must suppose to be a replacing or restoration of
    whatever there was standing on the old site. It can scarcely have been
    a palisade on the low ground below the castle rock. He then placed
    Humphrey de Tilliol, brother-in-law of Hugh de Grantmaisnil, to execute
    his orders, ‚Äú<span lang="la">qui Hastinges a prima die constructionis ad custodiendum
    susceperat</span>.‚Äù Wace‚Äôs description applies more to Hastings than to
    Pevensey, which was already walled in:‚Äî</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">De Tilliol‚Äôs occupation was confined to the construction or restoration
    of the defences: the castle and castelry, manor, and superiority of
    the whole Rape were granted by William to Robert, Earl of Eu, one of
    the most powerful of his Norman adherents. This grant of the castelry
    is recorded in Domesday, and a castelry involves the existence of a
    castle. The Earls of Eu held possession for five generations in the
    male line. No doubt either Earl William, who succeeded in 1090, or
    Earl Henry, who died in 1139, executed some works in masonry at the
    castle,‚Äîprobably the wall of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> much of which still
    remains. Either the first or second earls founded within the castle a
    free chapel and college, with a dean and secular canons, and to this
    Henry, the third earl, added a considerable endowment by charter in the
    reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> The college survived the castle, and flourished when
    the latter became a ruin. Thomas √† Becket held the deanery, and William
    of Wykeham one of the prebends. The college endured to the 38 Henry
    <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, when it was dissolved and the property alienated to Sir Anthony
    Brown. After the extinction of the Eu earldom, the patronage vested in
    the Crown. The charter of Earl Henry is recited in a confirmation, 22
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p>In 1088 the castle probably had been made strong, for it was the
    boast of William of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Calais, Bishop of Durham, that he secured
    Hastings for William Rufus. It was the place of muster for the powerful
    military force with which that king proposed to invade Normandy. At
    that time Anselm and many bishops and barons were present in and
    about the castle and were detained there from Candlemas, in 1094, for
    six weeks by contrary winds, during which time the king was present
    at the completion and consecration of his father‚Äôs Abbey of Battle.
    Immediately afterwards, Robert Bloet was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln
    within the chapel of the castle, and here also Bishop Herbert of
    Thetford was deprived of his see. It was in the castle of Hastings
    also, on this occasion, that Rufus once more refused attention to the
    reasonable remonstrances of Anselm, who left him unblessed to depart
    on his Norman expedition. The Earls of Eu, by no means always faithful
    vassals of the Crown of England, seem latterly to have neglected the
    castle, which was inferior to Pevensey as a muster-place for troops
    and had become of but moderate value. Henry, the fifth earl, who died
    in the reign of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, left an only daughter, Alice, who married
    Ralph de Essoudun, who in her right became Earl of Eu, and so died in
    1211. Their son, William, elected to become a subject of France, and,
    29 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, his possessions in England escheated to the Crown, and
    were granted to Prince Edward. As early as 1227 King Henry allowed to
    Robert de Aubeville 10 marcs, half his salary, as keeper of the castle.
    The college was retained by Henry in his own hands. In 5 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    the dean and canons petitioned to have the castle wall restored, it
    having been injured by the sea. In 1372, the castle was granted to John
    of Gaunt, and in the reign of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> it was a ruin and probably so
    remained. The early English work, especially connected with the chapel,
    was probably executed by Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> on his acquisition of the barony.</p>

  <p>By Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> the castle was granted to Rafe Neville, Earl of
    Westmoreland, with reversion to Sir John Pelham, who again transferred
    it, in 1412, to Sir Thomas Hoo, created Baron Hoo and Hastings in
    1447. He died without issue male about 1453. The feoffees of Sir
    Thomas sold the castle and other property, in 1461, to Sir William
    Hastings, who in that year was summoned to Parliament as Lord Hastings
    of Hastings. By his descendant, Henry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> Earl of Huntingdon, the castle
    and its appendages were sold, in 1591, to Sir Thomas Pelham, in whose
    descendant, now Earl of Chichester, they remain vested. Those who
    wish to understand thoroughly the position of Hastings as regards the
    landing, first movements, and subsequent advance of Duke William upon
    English soil, will do well to consult the very lucid and quite original
    account of the battle of Senlac, given in Mr. Freeman‚Äôs ‚ÄúHistory of the
    Conquest.‚Äù</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Hundred of Atiscross, in which Hawarden is an important parish, is,
    in Domesday, included in the county of Chester; and in that Hundred, as
    in very many parts of the Welsh border, the Saxons, as is well known
    from history and still evident from the prevailing names of places,
    early and in strength established themselves. But although the power
    of the Earls of Chester and the perfectly Saxonised condition of the
    peninsula of West Chester gave the invaders a secure hold over the
    open country on the west bank of the Dee, their sway was contested
    on the higher and more rugged ground, and though such names as Hope,
    Northop, Holywell, Whitford, Newmarket, Soughton, and Ryden show that
    they had settlements in the central and northern parts of Flintshire,
    the presence of a still larger number of Welsh names shows that their
    occupation was actively contested and the very reverse of secure.</p>

  <p>The length and severity of the struggle is also made evident by the
    number and magnitude of the various military earthworks which still
    attract attention. Such of these as are situated on the summits of
    hills, are of irregular form and bear Welsh names, may safely be
    attributed to the Welsh; while those of English origin, usually on more
    accessible ground, have a tendency to a circular form, and in some very
    marked instances are characterised by a mound or <i lang="fr">motte</i>.</p>

  <p>Hawarden, the Haordine of Domesday, and in Welsh called ‚ÄúPenard
    Halawg,‚Äù said to mean ‚Äúthe steep head of the marsh,‚Äù is, as its name
    declares, a Saxon settlement, and its fortress, so long preserved,
    presents in a remarkable degree the features of a well-known class
    of earthworks found both in England and in Normandy. The parish,
    containing about 16,000 acres, occupies the eastern or English end
    of the first high ground that rises west of the Dee. It includes the
    commencement of a wooded ridge, which runs for some way parallel to the
    estuary, and then trends inland to be lost in the higher country around
    Northop.</p>

  <p>The castle stands at the south-west end of a considerable area of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
    level sward, upon which is built the later house of Hawarden, and
    which, with a ravine bounding it on the south and west, is included in
    the park.</p>

  <p>The ground occupied by the castle and its earthworks covers an
    irregular circle of about 150 yards diameter. It rises steeply about 50
    feet from the level area, and almost abruptly 150 feet to 200 feet from
    the ravine that protects it on the south, south-east, and west.</p>

  <p>At the central and highest point of this ground, composed in part
    of rock and in part of the red sandy soil of the district, has been
    formed, by scarping down with perhaps some little addition in height,
    a conical mound, the flat top of which is about 70 feet diameter,
    having steep slopes all around. On the north-east side, or that towards
    the house, the descent is about 30 feet, at which level is a platform
    occupied by the main ward of the fortress, and beyond it, near the foot
    of a further but gentle slope, a broad and deep ditch, dry and wholly
    artificial, which sweeps round this the weakest side and cuts it off
    from the area already mentioned.</p>

  <p>About the other two thirds of its circumference, towards the south and
    west, the mound descends rapidly to the ravine, but on its way the
    slope is broken by concentric banks, ditches, and shelves, of somewhat
    irregular height, depth, and configuration, owing, no doubt, to their
    having been originally natural, but converted and strengthened by art.</p>

  <p>This kind of fortification by mound, bank, and ditch, is well known
    both in England and Normandy, and was in use in the ninth and tenth,
    and even in the eleventh centuries, before masonry was general. The
    mound was crowned with a strong circular house of timber, probably
    constructed like the walls of Greenstead chancel, and such as in the
    Bayeux tapestry the soldiers are attempting to set on fire. The court
    below and the banks beyond the ditches were fenced with palisades and
    defences of that character.</p>

  <p>The Normans in Normandy, towards the middle of the eleventh century,
    and in England a little later, and onwards into the reign of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    commonly replaced these defences by more substantial walls of masonry,
    which, being of great thickness and solidity, have often remained to
    the present day, though more frequently they were removed in the reigns
    of the earlier Edwards, to be replaced by structures of more scientific
    though less solid design, affording more accommodation within the
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. At Hawarden, the course of action seems to have been
    different. Here are no traces of Norman work or of the Norman style,
    and though the keep is unusually substantial, it bears evidence of
    being the work of one period, and that the close of the reign of Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or early in that of Edward, his Welsh-compelling son. If this be
    so, it must be concluded that the Norman barons, who were known to
    have held Hawarden in the twelfth century, were content to allow its
    defences to be formed of timber, as any masonry constructed by them
    would scarcely so soon have needed to be removed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

  <p>The <em>Keep</em> (A in the plan) very nearly covers the top of the
    mound. It is circular, 61 feet across at the base, and originally about
    40 feet high. The base gathers inwards to a height of 5 feet, where the
    cylinder is 59 feet across, and from hence to the summit it further
    diminishes to 57 feet. The interior is vertical, and 31 feet diameter
    throughout; hence the wall, which is 15 feet thick at the base, and 14
    feet a little above it, is 13 feet at the level of the rampart walk;
    dimensions of unusual solidity even at the Norman period and very rare
    in England under Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or the Edwards.</p>

  <p>The exterior is very plain, having neither cordon, string-course, nor
    window labels. A little above the ground is a double course of large
    ashlar blocks of a light yellow sandstone, tying the work firmly
    together, and higher up are other bonding courses of a less substantial
    character. The ordinary material is a bluish stone laid as rubble work,
    with the spaces and joints neatly filled up with spawls and fragments.
    The battlements have been replaced by a modern wall, but the junction,
    at the rampart walk, may be readily detected.</p>

  <p>The entrance is at the ground level on the north-east side, from the
    main ward. It is marked by a broad, flat buttress, rather Norman in
    character, which rises vertically from the common base so as to stand
    out about 18 inches, where it dies into the wall about 5 feet below the
    battlements. In its centre is the gateway, and above it the window of
    the portcullis chamber. It is extended laterally in two wings, rising
    about half its height, and also dying into the wall above. These are
    intended to strengthen the wall, weakened by a well-stair and a lodge.
    As this buttress covers a considerable segment of the circle and is
    flat, it is broken into three planes by two vertical angles. The modern
    brick and stone wall replacing the battlement is rugged and broken,
    but in parts about 12 feet high, and intended to give elevation to the
    keep. The building thus made extensively visible has become a sort
    of parish cynosure, and, however irregular its appearance, it would
    scarcely be in good taste to remove the addition.</p>

  <p>The keep has two floors. The lower is cylindrical, 31 feet in diameter,
    with walls 14 feet to 15 feet thick. It was about 14 feet high, with a
    ceiling of logs, which rested upon some forty plain corbels, of which
    about seventeen remain. At two opposite points, about half way up the
    wall, are two larger corbels, which evidently supported the struts
    destined to give stiffness to the central and longest beam.</p>

  <p>This chamber, no doubt a store-room, save when in time of siege it
    might accommodate soldiers, was entered directly from the gateway, and
    rather ventilated than lighted by three equidistant openings, about 4
    feet from the floor, 4 feet broad, and 5 feet high, having shouldered
    heads and covering. The sides converge, and the floor rises to a small
    square-headed loop of 4-inch opening. There is neither fireplace,
    seat, nor recess. The floor has been removed. There is no subterranean
    chamber.</p>

  <p>The upper chamber within is an octagon, inscribed about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> cylinder
    below it, with walls from 13 feet to 14 feet thick, and from side to
    side 31 feet. It is about 15 feet high to the corbels that carried
    its flat roof, and a row of larger corbels along one of the remaining
    faces seems to have supported struts necessary to make the roof a safe
    platform for military engines and stone ammunition. This, which was a
    state-room, was lighted by three recesses at irregular distances. They
    are 6 feet 6 inches wide, and rise from the floor 8 feet, being covered
    by slightly-pointed drop arches. Each has a vaulted roof and parallel
    sides, which afterwards converge upon a square-headed window, 2 feet
    wide and 5 feet 6 inches high, having a plain chamfer outside. In each
    side of the recesses is a plain shouldered doorway, 3 feet 9 inches
    broad by 10 feet high, opening into the mural gallery.</p>

  <p>This floor has its main entrance through the portcullis chamber,
    and next north-west of this entrance is the chapel. This is a mural
    chamber, 14 feet by 7 feet, but not quite rectangular. It is flat
    vaulted, and its axis points south-east to the altar, which is a
    restoration. The doorway next the west end is only 2 feet broad by 7
    feet high, with a cinquefoiled head and a plain moulding of Decorated
    character. The door opened inwards, and could be barred within the
    chapel. On the same side, but near the altar, is a small cinquefoiled
    recess for a piscina, with a projecting bracket and a fluted foot. In
    the opposite wall, in vaulted recesses, are two windows, that next the
    altar square-headed, the other lancet-headed. Against the west wall is
    a stone bench, and above it a rude squint through which any person in
    the adjacent window recess could see the altar.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the keep is by a gateway 5 feet wide and 6 feet 6
    inches high, having a drop arch rising about 3 feet more. The jambs
    have a single and the arch a double chamfer. Two feet within is the
    portcullis groove, 4 inches square, and next is the rebate for the
    door, with its bar holes. Beyond is the vaulted passage, 6 feet
    broad, leading to the ground floor, with a door opening so as to be
    barred against that chamber; within, however, is a narrow rebate, as
    though for a lighter door opening inwards. The portcullis grooves are
    stopped 3 feet above the floor, so that either the cill must have been
    obstructively high or the grate have terminated in a range of long
    spikes. On each side of the entrance passage is a shouldered doorway.
    That on the right, 2 feet 9 inches broad, opens into a mural chamber,
    vaulted, 6 feet by 9 feet, with a lancet loop to the field. On the
    left, the door is 3 feet 3 inches broad, and opens on a well-stair,
    which, lighted from the field by loops, ascends to the upper floor and
    the battlements.</p>

  <p>Twenty-one steps lead to the portcullis chamber, which is also the
    antechamber to the state-room. It is vaulted, 6 feet broad by 10 feet
    long, with a square-headed window of 2 feet opening to the field, and
    within it the chase for the passage of the portcullis. At the other end
    a large doorway with a plain moulding of a Decorated type and an arch
    very nearly, if not quite, round-headed, open in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> recess similarly
    arched, and this into the state-room. The door was barred inside so as
    to be held against the stairs.</p>

  <p>Returning to the well-stair, the upper part of which is broken away,
    at twenty-nine steps from the base is a small lancet-headed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
    door. It opens into a mural passage, 2 feet 6 inches broad, and 7 feet high,
    which makes two turns at right angles. At one, on the left, is a
    recess, 3 feet deep by 1 foot 9 inches broad, a garderobe, the back
    part of which, probably bratticed off, carried a shaft from a similar
    recess on the ramparts. At its second turn the passage descends seven
    steps to the nearest window recess in the main chamber, crossing which
    an opposite doorway leads into the mural gallery. The ascent and
    descent in the narrow passage is rendered necessary by the level of the
    steps of the well-stair.</p>

  <p>The mural gallery, at the main chamber level, is continued within the
    substance of the wall, to the recess next the chapel. It is in plan a
    polygon parallel with the inner faces of the wall. It is 10 feet high
    and 3 feet 9 inches wide, having a flagged roof resting on a double
    tier of corbels, and in it are three large recesses, each opening to
    the field by a long loop, swallow-tailed at each end. These recesses
    and loops are not seen from the main chamber. The doors and window
    frames, where original, are executed in straw-coloured sandstone. The
    chapel doorway and piscina and the side doors of the window recesses
    seem of later Decorated work than the rest, and may be insertions,
    though this does not look probable.</p>

  <p>The keep, as at Tamworth, Durham, Berkhampstead, Warwick, and Cardiff,
    stands in the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> line of the main ward, and forms part of
    it, about two thirds of its circumference being outside, and one third,
    including the doorway, inside the curtain. This curtain was about 460
    feet in length, and encircles the main ward, abutting against the keep
    at two points: one 24 feet south and one 18 feet north of the entrance.
    On each side it is carried down the slope, and, meeting below, thus
    encloses a somewhat fan-shaped area, about 170 feet north-east and
    south-west by 142 feet north-west and south-east, within which were
    the principal buildings of the fortress. The southern part of this
    curtain can be traced, but in its foundation only; that to the north is
    tolerably perfect. It is 7 feet thick, and has been about 25 feet high.
    It does not, as at Tamworth, so ascend the mound that its ramparts
    terminate at the level of the base of the keep, but it abuts against
    the keep at a height of 12 feet or 14 feet, and is so continued down
    the slope. Up the mound, the rampart of the curtain, as at Windsor, was
    a flight of steps, but as the ramparts only abutted against, and had no
    doorway into, the keep, the steps were merely to enable the defenders
    to man that part of the wall. On the north side, besides these steps,
    there was a second flight, laid on the surface of the mound, behind and
    at the foot of the curtain, and probably covered over, as traces remain
    of a second wall. These led to the entrance to the keep, and were the
    communication between it and the main ward.</p>

  <p>At the junction of this curtain with the keep is a postern, a small,
    shouldered doorway with a door barred within, where an enemy who had
    reached the foot of the keep could be attacked. About 90 feet lower
    down are traces of a similar doorway, whence the base of the mound
    could be reached. Of the south curtain a fragment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> remains attached to
    the keep; it had no postern, and probably no steps behind it.</p>

  <p>The <em>Main Ward</em> (B in the plan) is divided into two parts: the
    one a level platform, in which stood the hall and other buildings,
    round a court about 125 feet by 92 feet, and into which was the main
    entrance; and the other, and much smaller part is the steep slope of
    the mound, about 50 feet broad, and which was probably left rugged and
    waste as we now see it. At the foot of this slope are the remains of
    four rooms, about 18 feet deep from the face, probably for stores, each
    with a doorway to the court; in the wall of one is a sort of rude drain
    as from a sink or trough. This range was evidently continued along the
    south end of the court, being built against the curtain and carried on
    to the hall. Of these extensions only the excavated ground-floor, some
    low walls, and the base of a well-stair remain. From the character of
    the stair, it looks as though it had been of some consequence, and it
    shows that there was an upper floor, probably of rooms communicating
    with the hall, and perhaps connecting it with the keep.</p>

  <p>At the opposite, or north end of the store-room range is the doorway
    at the foot of the stairs leading to the keep, and beyond this, in the
    curtain wall, a door which seems to have led into a well-stair which
    gave access to the stepped rampart. Again, a few feet beyond this, at
    an angle of the enclosure, are the fragments of the great gateway,
    beyond which, for about 100 feet round the north angle of the court,
    the curtain is of full height and very perfect, having angle-quoins of
    the same yellow ashlar used in the keep.</p>

  <p>The <em>Hall</em> (C) was placed on the east face of the ward, at its
    south end, and occupied above one half of that face. The curtain formed
    its outer wall, and was pierced by its windows, and strengthened at its
    south-east angle by a solid, half-round buttress, 22 feet diameter,
    probably an addition. The hall was on the first floor, the low basement
    being probably a cellar, and entered by a vaulted passage at its south
    end. The hall was about 30 feet high from its timber floor to its wall
    plate. Two lofty windows remain, and traces of a third, and between
    them are the plain chamfered corbels whence sprung the open roof. The
    window recesses have a low-pointed arch and a bold bead moulding. The
    windows are of one light, trefoiled, with the cusp lights worked. There
    is no label. Within the recess are lateral seats.</p>

  <p>North of, and connected with the hall is a rectangular projection
    (D), 36 feet deep by 60 feet in front, the lower floors of which
    are laid on the scarp of the ditch, considerably below the level
    of the ward. These were doubtless offices, but as nothing but the
    lower walls remain little can be discovered of their detail. There
    remains, however, in the curtain the jamb of a large doorway, whence
    descends a flight of steps about 20 feet, probably to a postern, of
    which, however, there are no traces, on the edge of the ditch. These
    steps led into one of two apartments, at one end of each of which is
    what was probably a fireplace, though they more resemble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> the vent
    of a garderobe shaft, which, however, they cannot well be, since the
    chambers were certainly not cesspools. The walls of this projection are
    substantial, and certainly carried an upper storey, probably occupied
    by withdrawing-rooms and private apartments attached to the hall. No
    well has been discovered, nor oven, nor any signs of a garrison chapel,
    all which were probably placed in this ward.</p>

  <p>The great gateway opened in the north-west face of the curtain, and
    from the fragment of a jamb that remains with a bold rebate seems to
    have been about 8 feet high and broad in proportion. A projection
    inwards from the curtain shows that there was some kind of small
    gatehouse.</p>

  <p>This gateway opened into a spur work formed by two curtains, 32 feet
    apart, projecting from the main curtain down the scarp of the ditch so
    as to form a parallelogram 40 feet wide by 68 feet long. The curtains
    were 4 feet thick and about 24 feet high. The western is destroyed, but
    the eastern is tolerably perfect, and at its junction with the main
    curtain is a shouldered postern door, 2 feet 9 inches broad, which
    opened on the scarp of the ditch.</p>

  <p>At the further and lower end of the spur-work the walls turn inward (E
    in the plan), and again proceed parallel for 14 feet at 27 feet apart,
    and there contain the gates and pit of the drawbridge, beyond which a
    second narrowing reduces the distance to 21 feet, at which they proceed
    for 14 feet more, when the walls abut upon the counterscarp of the
    ditch, at that point revetted with ashlar. Thus the whole length of the
    spur-work, from the main curtain to the counterscarp, is 96 feet, and
    its breadths, over all, 40 feet, 25 feet, and 21 feet.</p>

  <p>About 34 feet in advance of the great gateway was a cross wall,
    probably containing a second gate, and beyond it is a flight of fifteen
    steps, 6 feet broad, leading down into a rectangular chamber, which
    has had a flat timber roof, and in the opposite wall of which is a
    shouldered doorway, with no rebate for a door, 2 feet 9 inches broad,
    and 7 feet high. This opens into a low, narrow, flat-topped passage,
    3 feet broad and 10 feet long, but expanded at the centre to 3 feet 6
    inches, so that two persons could pass by squeezing; and at this point,
    in the roof, is a hole 8 inches square, evidently for the purpose
    of attacking them if necessary. The passage ends in a second small
    doorway, barred from the inside, which opens upon a bridge-pit, about
    27 feet long right and left, 12 feet deep, and 10 feet broad, to a
    similar doorway opposite. The pit is lined with rubble below the door
    cills and with ashlar above, and at its west end is a hole, probably
    for cleaning it out, and communicating with the main ditch, of which
    the pit is an isolated part.</p>

  <p>Crossing over a narrow plank bridge, the further door leads through
    a short, narrow passage into a chamber 13 feet square, entirely of
    ashlar, and having, right and left, a small door, 2 feet 9 inches
    broad, opening upon the counterscarp of the ditch. The doorway from the
    bridge had no door but those of the lateral sally-ports opened inwards.
    In the further, or north, wall is another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> doorway, also shouldered,
    3 feet broad and 8 feet high, the door of which also opened inwards
    and disclosed a very steep flight of eleven steps, rising about 8 feet
    in a dovetail-shaped chamber, commencing at a breadth of 3 feet and
    expanding to 8 feet. It is 14 feet long. The steps land on a floor, but
    the walls, of which the lower 6 feet 6 inches, of ashlar, are quite
    perfect, have so far no openings. This singular chamber is niched into
    the counterscarp of the ditch, and is actually within the barbican.</p>

  <p>The remains of the <em>Barbican</em> (F) are a considerable knoll of
    earth, having a ditch of its own, and on its rugged surface showing
    traces of old buildings. This covers the head of the bridge, and
    appears to have been approached by a winding road and entered on the
    west side.</p>

  <p>This work has been the subject of much speculation. That it was the
    main entrance is sufficiently certain. This could only have been at
    one end of the main ward, and the remaining jamb is too large for
    a postern, and the ground at the opposite end far too steep for an
    approach.</p>

  <p>The spur-work, with its lateral curtains, completely enclosed the
    entrance. The steps to the bridge are modern, but must represent others
    somewhat similar. The doors and passage were calculated for single
    files only, with a special arrangement for commanding the only point at
    which two armed men could pass. In the chamber beyond the bridge 80 or
    100 men could assemble previous to a sally by the lateral doorways.</p>

  <p>On their return, if pursued, and the enemy should enter with them, the
    narrow passages would make almost impossible a surprise or any sudden
    rush into either the body of the place or the barbican.</p>

  <p>Further, looking to the lateral space between the walls and the
    great length of the bridge-pit, it is pretty clear that above the
    foot passage was a roadway for wheel carriages, with at least one
    drawbridge. Most of the passages below seem to have been flagged with
    stone. One drawbridge was clearly over the remaining pit; another may
    have covered the chamber at this time occupied by the modern flight of
    stairs. The thickness (4 feet) and solidity of the existing walls show
    that they must have been much higher, so that they would have formed
    lateral parapets, concealing the passage of the bridge. For this, about
    15 feet might be added to the existing wall.</p>

  <p>The fan-shaped chamber was probably an outlet for those who, having
    used the foot-bridge, did not wish to go out by the sally-ports but
    to ascend into the barbican. The steps are no doubt inconvenient, but
    the whole passage was certainly only meant for occasional use, and
    is in no part particularly commodious. Probably the means of egress
    from the stair-head into the barbican were stairs of timber. The
    whole arrangement is very peculiar, and it may be doubted whether the
    safety proposed was worth the considerable expense bestowed upon it.
    As the whole of this bridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> arrangement is clearly an addition, it is
    probable that though the original entrance was at this point, it was by
    an ordinary drawbridge, of which the lateral curtains of the spur-work,
    which are old, would be the protection.</p>

  <p>Of the exterior earthworks there is little to be said. On the
    south-east side of the fortress the outer bank is cut through, as
    though for an entrance. If so, this must have been carried laterally
    along the ditches of the place until it reached the barbican.</p>

  <p>Hawarden seems to present traces of at least three periods of
    construction, the oldest being that of the earthworks, which, like some
    similar ones in England, may be as early as the tenth century.</p>

  <p>The keep, the curtain of the main ward, the hall, and perhaps the
    curtains of the spur seem to be of one date, the material employed
    being substantially the same, and the workmanship not unlike.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="xsmall">Spur-work enclosing the main entrance.</span><br />
      <span class="smcap">Hawarden Castle. North-east side.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The range of storehouses in the main ward, the offices projecting from
    it towards the north-east, and the whole of the buildings of the foot
    entrance are of later date, and of different design, material, and
    workmanship. The material is a greenish sandstone, and the workmanship
    ashlar of the most expensive kind, dressed on every face, and laid in
    thin joints, with but little mortar. This excellence has proved fatal
    to the structure; for, as the stones needed only to be lifted from
    their beds and laid, without any adaptation, into any new work, the
    temptation has proved too strong, and most of this later work has been
    carefully removed by hand, and not, like the older work, overthrown
    by gunpowder. In fact, the lower walls that remain have much more the
    appearance of an unfinished than of a partially-destroyed building.</p>

  <p>There is a paper by the late Mr. Hartshorne in the fifteenth volume
    of the <cite>Arch√¶ological Journal</cite>, which, though it touches but
    lightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> upon the topography of the castle, enters at some length upon
    the history of the Barons of Montalt, long its owners. From thence,
    and from other sources, it appears that Hawarden belonged, from a
    very early period, to the Earls of Chester, some of whom probably
    constructed it, but no doubt occupied it before the completion of
    the structure. In their line it remained till the death of Ranulph
    de Blundeville, the last earl, in 1231, when, with Castle Rising and
    the ‚ÄúEarl‚Äôs Half,‚Äù in Coventry, it came to his second sister and
    co-heir, Mabel, who married William d‚ÄôAlbini, third Earl of Arundel.
    Their second son, Hugh, who inherited, died in 1243, when the estates
    passed to his second sister and co-heir, Cecilia, who married Robert de
    Montalt.</p>

  <p>The Barons de Monte-Alto, sometimes styled de Moaldis or Mouhaut (Mold,
    where the mound of the castle remains), were hereditary seneschals of
    Chester and lords of Mold. Roger de Montalt, grandson of Robert and
    Cecilia, inherited Hawarden, Coventry, and Castle Rising. He married
    Julian, daughter of Roger de Clifford, justice of North Wales, but
    dying childless, in 1297, his lands passed to his brother, Robert, the
    seventh and last lord, who died childless, 1329, when the barony became
    extinct. Robert de Montalt signed the celebrated letter to the Pope in
    1300, as Dominus de Hawardyn. [P. Writs, <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> 743.] He bequeathed his
    estates to Isabella, the queen of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></p>

  <p>The entries concerning Hawarden in the public records are few. In
    1265, 49 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the king granted to Llewelyn-ap-Griffith, Prince
    of Wales, the Castle of Hawardin, to him and the heirs of his body,
    Hereford, 22nd June [N. F≈ìd. <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> 457], but in 1267, 51 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, by a
    letter by the legate Ottoboni, Prince Llewelyn is at once to restore to
    Robert de Otto Monte the lands of Ha Wordin, but Robert is not to build
    a castle there for thirty years. Montgomery 3 Kal. Oct. [Ibid. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 474.]</p>

  <p>In the Inquisitions and Escheats are also some entries. From an
    inquisition, 3 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Robert de Monte Alto is seized of the manor
    of Hawardine, co. Cest. His possessions were extensive. They occupy
    ninety-one entries in thirteen counties. [Inq. p.m. I. 55.] In the next
    year, 4 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, is an inquisition, whence it appears that the manor
    was never settled in dower. Neither Leuca, wife of Robert de Montalt
    the Black, nor Matilda, wife of Ralph de Montalt, nor Nicholaa, wife of
    Roger de Montalt the elder, nor Cecilia, wife of Roger the younger‚Äîall
    ladies of the Honour of Hawirdyn‚Äîwere ever so endowed. [Ib. 60, Cal.
    Geneal. <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> 247.] 10 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 25 March, is an entry on the Welsh roll
    concerning the pursuing and taking certain Welsh malefactors, who
    took captive Roger de Clifford in the king‚Äôs castles of Hawardin and
    Flint [Ayloffe, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 76], and from the king‚Äôs writ itself of that date,
    addressed to Roger de Mortimer, and given at length by Mr. Hartshorne,
    it appears that the Welsh attacked Hawarden by night, killed some of
    De Clifford‚Äôs household, and burnt the castle houses, and did much
    the same at Flint. This outrage was repeated in the next year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> when
    (6 November, 1282) the justice‚Äôs elder son, also Roger Clifford, was
    slain. [Foss‚Äôs ‚ÄúJudges,‚Äù <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> 76.] The next entry in the inquisition
    is one of 25 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> on Roger de Montalt, whence it appears that at
    that time, though he held Castle Rising, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, the manor of Hauwerthyn
    was vested in Thomas de Offeleye. This might, however, be as feoffee in
    trust. [Inq. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>m. <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> 134.]</p>

  <p>From all this it may be inferred that there was a castle here which
    Prince Llewelyn destroyed, and which Robert de Montalt undertook not
    to rebuild. Such promises went for as little then as between nations
    at the present day, and the castle that the Welsh took 10 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    1282, was of course built or restored during that period. If Llewelyn
    had found a keep of anything at all approaching in substance to the
    present he could scarcely have destroyed it; nor does it seem probable,
    from the internal evidence of the building, that the keep now standing
    was the work taken by the Welsh, 10 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> Its mouldings and the
    plan of its upper floor point to a rather later date; and probably
    it was the work of the last Baron de Montalt, between 1297 and 1329.
    Cylindrical keep towers, of a pattern not unlike that of Hawarden,
    though usually, as at Coucy, on a much larger scale, were in use in
    France in the earlier part of the thirteenth century; and although the
    unusual thickness of the walls in the present example might be thought
    more in keeping with the Norman period, the general details, the
    polygonal mural gallery and interior, and the entrance, evidently parts
    of the original work, are very decidedly Edwardian.</p>

  <p>Hawarden was finally dismantled by order of Parliament, in the time
    of the Commonwealth, and the keep much shattered by a mine, sprung
    probably under the doorway. It so remained until very recently, when it
    was restored by Sir Stephen Glynne, the late owner, under the advice
    of Mr. Shaw, of Chester. The task was one of exceeding delicacy, but
    was executed with marvellous skill and complete success, so far as the
    work proceeded. Enough remained of each part to give a clue for its
    reproduction, and thus the gateway, portcullis chamber, much of the
    well-staircase, most of the chapel, and part of the great mural gallery
    have been restored just as they must have been left by the original
    builder. At the same time the stone employed and the mode of dressing
    it, will always indicate to the skilled observer which parts of the
    work have been replaced.</p>

  <p>The present access to the rampart is an addition in brick of the
    last century, and might well be restored in stone. The view thence
    is extensive, having in the foreground the park, which, for wildness
    and sylvan beauty may well compare with any ground even on the Welsh
    border; and beyond is the broad and fertile plain of Cheshire and
    Shropshire, including the city of Chester, the rock and ridge of
    Beeston, and, in clear weather, the Wrekin. In the opposite direction
    are views, less extensive, of the estuary of the Dee and the peninsula
    of West Chester. The Welsh view is inconsiderable, being cut off by the
    higher ground.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="HELMSLEY_CASTLE_YORKSHIRE">HELMSLEY CASTLE, YORKSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">HELMSLEY, the Elmeslae of Domesday and the Hamlake of genealogists,
    is the name of an extensive tract of wild moorland which lies on the
    southern slope of the Cleveland Hills, in the north-east corner of the
    North Riding of Yorkshire. The hills rise to 1,400 feet above the sea,
    but Helmsley Moor hardly reaches 1,100 feet, and the town of Helmsley,
    placed where the uplands pass into the plain, scarcely stands at 200
    feet.</p>

  <p>The real river of Helmsley, descending from the moors, is the Seph;
    but after its union with the Rye, the stream and the dale bear the
    name of the latter water, made famous by the Abbey of Rievaulx, about
    four miles below which, sweeping round the well-wooded promontory of
    Duncombe, the stream, returning somewhat upon its former course, forms
    the southern boundary of the castle and the town.</p>

  <p>The castle is barely included in Duncombe Park, part of its eastern
    outwork being traversed by the border. Its position, if not specially
    striking, is yet strong, and favourable to the works which rendered
    it in former days almost impregnable. The low platform upon which it
    stands is mainly of rock, and the labour employed has been rather that
    of removing than of making ground, the ditches being wholly artificial.</p>

  <p>Besides the Rye, which, where it flows about a furlong south of the
    castle, has low and swampy banks, the Etton beck, close upon the east,
    between the town and the castle, descends on its way to the Rye, at a
    level which allowed of its waters being employed to flood the ditches
    of the fortress.</p>

  <p>The plan of the castle is rectangular, and its earthworks are upon
    a scale not usual with castles of pure Norman origin, and which,
    notwithstanding their form, raises a surmise that they may be of much
    earlier date.</p>

  <p>The main ward of the castle is about 200 feet square, level, and
    contained within a deep and broad ditch, completely surrounding it. A
    moderate bank of earth crowns the edge of the slope, partly, no doubt,
    original, but in part composed of the ruins of the curtain.</p>

  <p>Beyond the ditch, and forming its counterscarp, is a ridge or bank
    of earth a few feet lower than the level of the ward, and therefore
    commanded by it. This ridge, interrupted at the southern angle, so
    as to communicate with the excavations beyond, is expanded upon the
    north-west front and again still more considerably upon the opposite
    or south-east front, so as to form a lesser and a greater barbican,
    covering the two entrances to the place.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_101">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Again, beyond the ridge is a second ditch, also encircling the whole
    place, and passing, therefore, in front of the barbicans. This, in its
    turn, is succeeded by a second or outer bank, also interrupted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> and
    in three places, at the north, south, and east angles. This also is of
    variable breadth: somewhere, a mere ridge; in other places, as before
    the two fronts, expanded into broad platforms, covering the entrances
    and the approaches to them. Supposing these ditches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> to contain
    either water or mud, the interruption in the banks would very much
    increase the difficulties of those besieging the place, by breaking the
    communications, and preventing them from attacking the barbicans by the
    flanks. There are traces, outside this second bank, of a third ditch,
    which, however, seems to have been confined to such points as were
    supposed especially to need further protection.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp48" id="i_102">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

  <p>It is evident that an earthwork such as that described, covering above
    ten acres of ground, and with ditches 60 feet to 70 feet broad, and
    deep in proportion, would, in resolute hands, and properly palisaded,
    be a most formidable stronghold. That such was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> nature of the
    defences contemplated seems certain, since the banks would not support
    masonry; and although the edge of the inner ditch was of firm ground,
    the bank or crest thrown up upon it was not, and had masonry been
    contemplated, would have been superfluous.</p>

  <p>When the Norman engineer undertook to fortify the place, he seems to
    have confined himself to the construction of a curtain of 10 feet thick
    round the inner area, placing it on the firm ground, and employing the
    earth-bank as a ramp against the wall; to this he added a gatehouse at
    each end, and a work of some strength as a barbican beyond the inner
    ditch; then a second gatehouse, placed upon the barbican; and finally a
    second or outer bridge. On the west side of the inner area, where the
    rock was firm, a low cliff of 20 feet to 25 feet was substituted for
    the slope of the ditch.</p>

  <p>Besides the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> or curtain-wall, the four drawbridges, and
    probably four gatehouses, there seem to have been four drum-towers‚Äîone
    capping each angle of the place. It is true that these are no longer
    to be seen; but a circular heap of rubbish at each angle seems to
    represent such towers which, indeed, were the usual and necessary
    constituents of such a work, though whether these towers were of the
    Norman period may be doubted: probably they were later.</p>

  <p>In addition to these works, and reared up high above them all, was the
    rectangular keep, placed near the centre of the east or town side, and
    upon and forming a part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. Opposite to the keep,
    and also forming a part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, but on the west side,
    and built therefore upon the edge of the cliff, were the domestic
    buildings, some parts of which remain mixed up with later works. It may
    be also seen that a cross curtain between the keep and the domestic
    buildings divided the ward into a northern and a southern court, and it
    would seem that a fragment now standing, and which has much the air of
    having been part of a chapel, was connected, as at Knaresborough, with
    this wall.</p>

  <p>The keep appears to have been a square of 53 feet, and although about
    9 feet of it are buried in earth and rubbish, it still rises to about
    90 feet. Rather more than the outer or eastern half has been blown up,
    and has fallen into the ditch, and what remains has suffered much from
    alterations and additions. It is built in rubble of a very ordinary
    description, but with quoins and dressings of ashlar. The plinth, if
    one there be, is of course concealed. The walls are plain, 9 feet
    thick, having neither string nor set-off, and but one low pilaster
    buttress, which rises to the first floor only, and is placed upon the
    west end of the north wall, to give strength to an interior stair. At
    the two remaining angles are nooks, but not intended to carry shafts or
    beading.</p>

  <p>The original tower was composed of a basement and first floor, about 70
    feet high, or, as now seen, 60 feet. There remains within, against the
    west wall, a not very high-pitched weather-table, which shows, as at
    Porchester and Richmond, where the roof abutted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> against the wall as a
    gable. The wall was carried all round, high enough to conceal the roof.
    The west angle contains a well-staircase, which rose from the basement
    to the first floor. The door into the basement is buried, but the line
    of the steps in the wall points downwards. A breach has been effected
    in the west wall exposing the staircase, and seems to occupy the place
    of a loop.</p>

  <p>In the west wall of the basement are two acutely-pointed recesses,
    terminating in square-headed loops; and in the south wall is a doorway,
    of 5 feet 6 inches opening, also under an acute arch. It is possible
    that this basement was vaulted, though it is more probable that the
    covering was of timber.</p>

  <p>The first floor was originally lighted by three windows, in early
    pointed recesses, of different sizes and heights, and above the
    central recess, which was placed lower, to give place for it, are a
    round-headed recess and a window, placed in the angle of the gable.
    The three lower windows have been replaced by three lancets, and the
    recesses reduced in height and proportion to suit. The later arch is
    handsomely ribbed. It is uncertain how the first and main floor was
    covered over. In the north wall are seen the springing-stones of three
    ribs, evidently part of a vault; but near them is a short table, with
    four corbels, possibly connected in some way with the stair-entrance.
    Also there are fragments of two ribs in the west wall, so that the
    arrangements of the vaulting are obscure. The ribs mentioned are
    plainly chamfered, and may be early English, or later. An addition of
    about 30 feet has been made to the original keep, giving it an upper
    or second floor. In the west wall of this addition is a pointed window
    in a segmental recess, resting on the old masonry. In the north wall
    is another pointed window and a fireplace. There is a loop towards the
    south; but this part of the wall, both inside and out, is obscured
    by ivy. In the wall of this floor, cutting the line of the windows,
    is a corbel-table, the corbels cut somewhat into the shape of heater
    shields. This must have supported the roof, but have interfered
    seriously with the windows. How this story was reached does not appear;
    probably by a well-stair in the wall, now destroyed, a point which
    could, no doubt, be ascertained by uncovering the fragments in the
    ditch. The upper wall seems as thick as that below; and it is curious
    that there are no traces visible of mural galleries or chambers.</p>

  <p>The battlements remain perfect, so far, at least, as are the walls they
    crown. The embrasures are of moderate size, and the merlons broad, and
    the running moulding is carried round the whole. At each angle is a
    square turret, rising about 10 feet above the curtains. These turrets
    rest upon a light bracket outside, and each of the outer faces is
    flanked by two light, slender buttresses, in tabernacle work, resting
    below upon brackets, and, no doubt, once ending above in delicate
    finials. In each face is a single embrasure. Of course, all these are
    additions.</p>

  <p>The question of the entrance to this keep is obscure. There remain
    three doors, any one of which would serve. That on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> ground floor to
    the south; a small round-headed door at the first floor level to the
    north; and a third door, in the same wall, a little lower down, leading
    into the well-stair. There are, however, indications that none of these
    was the real entrance. Against the south wall are traces of attached
    masonry, probably of a forebuilding, containing and covering the
    entrance, which in that case would have been in the south wall near the
    east end, a part now destroyed. The staircase seems to have commenced
    against the south-west end of this wall, and to have passed over the
    present door, which probably, as at Rochester, opened into a cell below
    the staircase of the forebuilding. This conclusion is strengthened by
    the presence of seven holes in the keep-wall at the rampart level,
    evidently to carry a brattice commanding the staircase below. Also,
    high up in the same wall, there projects a mass of ashlar, which may
    very well have been part of a machicolation, overhanging the door at
    the stair-head: arrangements similar to these are not uncommon in keeps
    of this pattern. Of the other doors the small round-headed one may very
    well have opened upon the ramparts as at Clitheroe; and that which is
    let into the well-stair, now closed and converted into a loop, looks
    rather of a Decorated character, and may be an insertion, and may have
    led into some annexed building now destroyed. At the period when this
    tower was built there was no longer that extreme caution in allowing no
    more than one entrance to the keep.</p>

  <p>It would seem that the original keep was late Transition or pointed
    Norman, and therefore might well have been built, as supposed, by
    Robert de Ros, surnamed Fursan, who held the lordship from 1184 to
    1226, and probably completed the work before 1200. Then came the
    alteration in the first floor in a most decided early English style,
    and therefore probably by Robert de Ros, Fursan‚Äôs grandson, who married
    the heiress of Belvoir, and flourished between 1257 and 1285. Then
    followed the addition of the upper story, and of the battlements and
    turrets, all rather late Decorated. This might well be the work of
    William de Ros, who held Helmsley from 1317 to 1342, to whom, in 1337,
    was granted the tower built by Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> in London, near Baynard‚Äôs
    Castle, and which seems to have stood on the bank of Fleet-ditch, where
    some ancient foundations were recently laid open in the formation of
    the new street. This he was to hold as appendant to his Castle of
    Helmsley.</p>

  <p>The domestic buildings standing opposite to the keep are composed
    of two blocks. One a square mass of great height, and with walls of
    considerable thickness, has traces of transition Norman or early
    English work, but has undergone alteration in the Decorated period,
    and finally in that of the sixteenth century. The other or northern
    building may be on early foundations, and probably is so, but its
    fittings are of the sixteenth century, and probably the work of the
    Earl of Rutland, whose armorial bearings are embossed in plaster on a
    deep cornice and on the panelled ceiling, all now in the last stage of
    decay.</p>

  <p>The northern gatehouse, and any structure that may have stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> upon the
    smaller barbican, have disappeared utterly from sight, though probably
    their foundations could be laid open. To the south there is more to
    be seen. The inner gatehouse indeed is ruined, and nothing is visible
    above the rubbish save the outline of the western jamb, which shows a
    portcullis groove and rebate for folding-gates.</p>

  <p>The outer gatehouse and its barbican form a very remarkable work.
    This barbican is, as has been stated, an expansion of the bank which
    surrounds the inner ditch. It is here above 80 feet broad, and long
    enough to cover completely the southern front of the place. The
    gatehouse, like that behind it, is much nearer to the east than to the
    west end of the work. It is composed of two small round turrets, and
    two large drum-towers flanking the portal. On either side of these
    extend the curtains, which terminate in a pair of large drum-towers,
    which flank and close the outwork.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse is tolerably perfect on the ground floor. The upper story
    is in ruins. The portal, about 32 feet deep, is vaulted throughout at
    different heights and with arches of different curves. It was defended
    by a portcullis and a pair of gates. The outer portal is handsome and
    peculiar. It is of about 10 feet opening, and shoulder-headed, the
    shoulders being worked brackets. Above is a pointed arch of relief, and
    the tympanum between the two is composed of stones joggled together
    with great neatness. Above is a good flat-topped Decorated window of
    two lights trefoiled. Traces of the chain-holes for the bridge are
    seen in the spandrels of the portal. The gatehouse is evidently of
    two periods. All behind the portcullis groove is original, either
    late Norman or early English. The groove with all before it is late
    Decorated, probably of the age of the upper story of the keep.</p>

  <p>Much as the buildings of this castle have suffered, it is curious that
    the piers, counter-piers, and bridge-pits of the four bridges should
    remain quite perfect, and all of excellent ashlar. The inner, or pier
    from which the bridge dropped, is from 9 feet to 12 feet long, and
    the pit across which it dropped of 12 feet opening. The counter-pier,
    upon which the bridge dropped, is much longer, from 40 to 45 feet, and
    as this long and exposed causeway was but 12 feet broad, any body of
    enemies approaching by it would be placed at a great disadvantage.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to form an opinion upon the age of the earthworks of
    this castle. Either the Romans or the Normans might have laid out an
    earthwork on a rectangular plan, but when either people desired to
    construct a place of excessive strength, they employed masonry rather
    than earthworks. The Saxons and early English, on the other hand,
    though much given to employ defences of earth, and often upon an
    immense scale, are not known ever to have made them rectangular. What
    was the practice of the Romanised Britons, who, inheriting something of
    Roman arts and military rules, might also well have derived from their
    Celtic forefathers a taste for works in earth, is not known. Such a
    fortification as the present may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> possibly be in part their work. Of
    course, it is possible that the whole may have been the work of Robert
    Fursan, especially as, remarkable as it is, it is not named in Domesday
    nor any early record.</p>

  <p>Helmsley appears, as has been stated, in Domesday as ‚ÄúElmeslae, in
    the wapentake of Langeberg.‚Äù It is now in that of Ryedale; but that
    this is the place meant seems certain, from its entry in company with
    Sprostune, now Sproxton, one of its townships, and Harun, now Harome, a
    chapelry in the parish. The entries are of a very ordinary description.
    The tenants are‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">In Sprostune Turloge Normand et Sortcolf; in Elmeslae,
    tres Taini; in Harum Sortcol</span>.‚Äù When these holders were swept away
    and who succeeded to them, is not known; but, according to Dugdale,
    Helmsley was held in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> by Walter L‚ÄôEspec, a very
    famous baron. He appears as connected with Yorkshire, Bedfordshire, and
    Carlisle, in the Pipe-roll of 31 Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1130‚Äì1; and having lost his
    only son by a fall from his horse, he founded the abbeys of Kirkham
    and Rievaulx in Yorkshire, and Wardon in Bedfordshire. L‚ÄôEspec was a
    Norman, and held estates in Normandy, but when or how he came over is
    not recorded. A certain William Spech is recorded in Domesday as a
    great tenant in Bedfordshire, and he may be the father of Walter, who
    had lands there. He died in 1153, and in 1157‚Äì8 Walter de Bussei is
    found moving against Robert de Ros for the partition of this estate.
    Who this Robert de Ros was is uncertain. Adelina, Walter‚Äôs daughter and
    co-heir, married Peter de Ros, who in her right was of Helmsley, or, as
    it was always called, Hamlake.</p>

  <p>Peter de Ros, whose name was derived from his lordship of Ros, in
    Holderness, was, by Adelina, father of Everard de Ros, who appears in
    the Liber Niger as the tenant <i lang="la">in capite</i> of several Yorkshire
    fees, which no doubt included Helmsley, as many of the tenants‚Äô names
    are local, as Hairun, Spouston, and Stainesgrave. Everard, being under
    age, was then in the wardship of Ranulph de Glanvill. He died before
    1186, and was succeeded by his son Robert, third Lord of Hamlake,
    surnamed Fursan, one of the Magna Charta barons, and the reputed
    builder of Helmsley Castle. He died as a Templar, and his effigy is
    still pointed out in their church in London.</p>

  <p>Robert de Ros, his grandson, who probably executed the earliest
    additions to the work of his grandfather, married Isabel d‚ÄôAlbini,
    heiress of Belvoir.</p>

  <p>From them came William de Ros, seventh lord of Hamlake, who died
    1342‚Äì3, and probably completed the keep and the outer gatehouse and
    barbican at Helmsley. With his descendant, Edmund, fifteenth lord, the
    male line failed, and Helmsley passed with his sister and co-heiress
    Eleanor, to Sir Robert Manners, or rather to their son, George Manners.</p>

  <p>His descendant, Francis Manners, sixth Earl of Rutland, became Lord
    Ros of Hamlake by patent, which, however, died with him, as he left
    a daughter only, Katherine, who married George Villiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> Duke of
    Buckingham, whose son dissipated the estate, which, at his death, was
    sold to the ancestor of the present owner. The barony of Ros, or Roos,
    of Hamlake, was called out of abeyance, but exists quite separated from
    the castle or estate.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="HEREFORD_CASTLE">HEREFORD CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE borderers of England, whether on the north or on the west, were
    bold, hardy, and aggressive races of men, having for their patrimony
    the moor and the morass, the wild bleak upland which occurs on the
    Scottish frontier, or the steep crags and rugged defiles which gave
    strength and, in ordinary cases, impunity to the Welsh. The Scots,
    indeed, came of the same stock with the English, and had recently
    formed a part of the same kingdom, under the same lords; nor was the
    land immediately south of the Tyne or the Tweed materially richer
    than that to its immediate north. But the Welsh had other more potent
    and better causes for their continual and ferocious transgressions.
    They were the earlier possessors of the whole country, a possession
    still attested by the names of hills and rivers, and, indeed, of many
    of the chief cities of England. They were of an entirely different
    blood and language from either Saxon or Norman: by the one they had
    been gradually driven into the western and less fertile tracts of the
    island, and the other held them cooped up and at bay within their
    mountain fastnesses, and responded to their continual partisan warfare
    by occasional invasions on a large, and, for the time, irresistible
    scale.</p>

  <p>Full in view of the Welsh mountains were spread out some of the most
    fertile lands in Britain‚Äîcultivated, inhabited, and fortified by the
    invaders, who, not content with the slopes of the Cotteswold and the
    velvet meads on the left bank of the Severn, had pushed their conquests
    far beyond the right bank, holding the stately ridge of Malvern and the
    rich pastures of the Teme, the Lug, the Frome, the Worm, and the Wye,
    even up to the Dyke of Offa. That dyke, still to be traced along much
    of its length, between the estuaries of the Severn and the Dee, was
    felt to be a perpetual mark of inferiority, an abiding affront to the
    patriotic feelings of every Welshman. No marvel, then, that the Welsh
    were ever insurgent, ever breaking forth with fire and sword into the
    English territory, and especially into the most rich and, by nature,
    least-protected tract of it, the fair county of Hereford.</p>

  <p>Herefordshire was first subjugated by the Romans. Three miles north of
    the city are the remains of a camp, probably British, covering about
    thirty acres of ground, and now known as Sutton Walls, a little south
    of which runs the line of the road which led to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> Roman town of
    Magna Castra, four miles to the west, and was continued onward in the
    same direction.</p>

  <p>At what precise period Herefordshire passed under the Saxon yoke, and
    became annexed to Mercia, is unknown‚Äîprobably under Creoda, early in
    the seventh century. The see was founded in 680, when a synod was
    held here under Putta, the first bishop. Sutton, or Southton, so
    called from its position close south of the Roman camp to which it
    has given its name, was at a very early period a residence of the
    Mercian kings. Here, in the middle of the eighth century, resided the
    celebrated Offa, probably during the construction of his dyke, which
    passes about six miles to the west; and here in 794 was committed the
    murder of Ethelbert, his intended son-in-law, a deed which led to the
    aggrandisement of the cathedral church, to which Offa‚Äôs penitential
    donations were largely paid. A charter of King C≈ìnulf, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
    799, mentions Hereford, as do others by Deneberht, in 802 and 803,
    the last recording certain ‚Äú<span lang="la">monasteria qu√¶ olim in antiquis dictis ad
    Herefordensem ecclesiam pr√¶stita fuerunt</span>.‚Äù Sutton continued a Mercian
    palace until the union of the seven kingdoms, under Egbert of Wessex,
    in 827.</p>

  <p>Edward the Elder, a great constructor of strong places, who repaired
    the citadel and walls of Chester in 909, is said by Grafton also to
    have fortified Hereford, erecting a strong castle there. His sister
    Ethelfleda, a still greater castle-builder than he, and to whom are due
    the mounds of Tutbury, Tamworth, Leicester, and some others, was the
    widow of Ethelred, Duke of Mercia, in 915, when the Danes had advanced
    by the Wye, and taken captive the Bishop of Archenfield. She attacked
    and defeated them before Hereford, no doubt making use of the new
    defences. She died shortly afterwards.</p>

  <p>Early in the eleventh century, the Saxon sway had been so far
    extended as to have left the Dyke behind, and Wales was regarded as
    a part of England, and an attempt made to force it to contribute to
    the common tax for the defence of the island against the Danes. For
    this purpose Edwin, the Ealderman of the Mercians, led an army as
    far as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David‚Äôs, punishing the people for their refusal. At that
    period, and during the reign of the Confessor, the Welsh were led by
    Griffith-ap-Llewelyn, the ablest of their princes, and, indeed, the
    only one who ever held the Welsh together, or gave the English cause
    for anything like serious apprehension. Aided sometimes by the Danes
    from Ireland, sometimes by traitorous Saxon chiefs, and sometimes
    even by the discontented Normans, he is found during the first half
    of the eleventh century waging on the whole a successful war against
    Herefordshire. It is certain, from the number, magnitude, and character
    of the existing earthworks, that Irchen or Archenfield, called from
    its beech-trees ‚ÄúTrefawrth‚Äù by the Welsh, and sometimes by the English
    ‚ÄúFernley,‚Äù had from a very early period been inhabited by the English;
    but either distrusting these, or because he wished to quarter afar
    off the visitors whom he attracted, but of whom he was afraid, the
    Confessor made large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> grants of land along this district to his Norman
    courtiers, with whom, therefore, Griffith had not unfrequently to deal.</p>

  <p>The earliest of these grants seems to have been made to Richard
    Fitz-Scrob, whose fortress, built after a fashion till then unknown in
    England, gave great and general offence. His original castle has been
    replaced by later structures, now also in ruin, but the earthworks are
    probably original; and the name of Richard‚Äôs Castle shows how deeply
    the fear of its builders was impressed upon the people; and it is,
    moreover, a very rare example of a parish bearing a purely Norman name.</p>

  <p>These grants were opposed by Earl Godwin and his sons, and it was to
    enforce his remonstrances against them that the English Thane led a
    force from Beverstone, and challenged the Confessor to give up his
    stranger favourites‚Äîa struggle which finally ended in the temporary
    banishment of that truly English noble.</p>

  <p>In 1052, during Godwin‚Äôs exile, Griffith invaded Herefordshire, and
    advanced as far as Leominster before Fitz-Scrob and his Normans were in
    the field to meet him. They were beaten in a pitched battle, and upon
    open ground.</p>

  <p>In 1055, the earldom of Hereford was in the hands of Ralph, surnamed
    ‚Äúthe Timid.‚Äù Griffith, uniting with √Ülfgar, the Saxon lord of the East
    Angles, who was accompanied by an Irish force, burst into Archenfield,
    and again laid waste the border. Two miles from Hereford, Griffith and
    √Ülfgar were met by Earl Ralph, who seems, with the Norman contempt for
    infantry, to have placed undue weight upon his cavalry, the result
    of which was a complete defeat. Griffith entered Hereford, which was
    undefended, sacked and burnt the city, treated the cathedral and the
    clergy with excessive severity, and destroyed what the ‚ÄúBrut‚Äù calls
    the gaer, that is, the castrum or fort. The account seems to imply
    that the city was not then fortified. Mr. Freeman thinks the gaer was
    a work of masonry. However that may be, there is little doubt but that
    it was a work on the site of the later castle, for by the riverside,
    for defence, it would certainly be placed; and as the position of the
    cathedral has doubtless always been the same, there would scarcely be
    room for a fortress between its precincts and the western marsh. The
    position of the bridge, too, is probably ancient, and this would lead
    into the city, not into the gaer. The appearances of the earthworks,
    as they existed before the removal of the mound and the filling up of
    its proper ditch, much resembled those of Tamworth, and other works
    attributed to Edward and Ethelfleda, and the gaer may well have been of
    that date, so far as the earthworks were concerned. This inroad of the
    Welsh in 1055 was the most severe and the most lasting in its effects
    of any on record. All Archenfield suffered, and traces of the spoiler
    are recorded long afterwards in Domesday.</p>

  <p>Although Godwin‚Äôs return from banishment in 1052 had been followed by
    the putting forth of most of the Norman intruders, Richard Fitz-Scrob,
    one of the most offensive, seems to have remained, and long afterwards
    to have put down Edric the Wild;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> and his son Osborn, after a short
    exile in Scotland, came back to Herefordshire, and held office and
    dignities both before and after the Conquest.</p>

  <p>In 1055 Godwin was dead, and to Harold, as Earl of the West Saxons, it
    belonged to redeem the disgrace incurred by Ralph the Timid. He lost
    no time in preparation. In the course of the same year he mustered his
    forces at Gloucester, and by his mere presence cleared Hereford of the
    Welsh and √Ülfgar. He at once fortified Hereford. Whether he restored
    the castle is unknown, but he surrounded the city with a wall, no doubt
    along the line of the later structure. Mr. Freeman supposes Harold‚Äôs
    work to have been a mere ‚Äúdyke of earth and loose stones,‚Äù Florence
    of Worcester describes it as ‚Äú<span lang="la">Vallum latum et altum.</span>‚Äù Domesday,
    however, records a ‚Äú<span lang="la">murus</span>‚Äù at Hereford as having stood in the time of
    the Confessor, so that Harold, when Hereford came under his immediate
    government, may, as Mr. Freeman suggests, have replaced his vallum
    with a wall of masonry. Harold‚Äôs defences probably did not include the
    suburb, which even then must have existed, since we read in Domesday of
    burghers within and burghers without the walls; though the latter would
    derive a not incomplete protection from the broad belt of marsh which
    then surrounded the city.</p>

  <p>Griffith had sought and received terms of peace. Nevertheless it did
    not suit him to allow Hereford to become a strong post. Early in 1056
    he again crossed the border. He was opposed by Leofgar, the new bishop,
    who, however, was slain in the first combat. His successor, Ealdred‚Äîa
    man of equal determination with better fortune,‚Äîheld the Welsh in
    check, and negotiated a peace, and the fortifications of Hereford were
    completed.</p>

  <p>In 1062 Griffith again appears upon the scene. Probably he traversed
    Herefordshire, for he crossed the Severn in the diocese of Worcester.
    On this occasion Harold‚Äîappearing, not as the defender of this or
    that province, but of the whole kingdom‚Äîexecuted a counter movement,
    and invaded North Wales. This was followed in 1063 by Harold‚Äôs great
    invasion, in which Griffith was murdered by his own countrymen, and
    Wales submitted, having deprived herself of her greatest son. It was at
    the conclusion of this war that Harold employed himself in constructing
    a sort of hunting-lodge for his sovereign in the low lands of Gwent, at
    Port-skewet, where earthworks are still seen. The lodge was attacked
    and destroyed while in progress by Caradoc-ap-Griffith-ap-Rhydderch, of
    South Wales.</p>

  <p>Hereford played no part in the Conquest; but the city and shire
    occupy a respectable place in the Domesday Survey, where the customs
    are related in great detail. The king had six moneyers there, and
    the bishop one. Of the city burgesses 103 held of the king, and
    twenty-seven had held of Earl Harold. All the tenants of the burgh were
    liable to military service against the Welsh.</p>

  <p>The customs called of the Welsh in King Edward‚Äôs land in Arcenefeld,
    or Irchenfield, also there recorded, are curious, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> show not only
    the early existence of a local militia to resist the Welsh, but that
    the people were mostly of Welsh blood, and were employed against their
    countrymen. The king held three churches there, and the priests of them
    were to be the king‚Äôs legates or ambassadors in Wales, and when the
    army marched against an enemy, to the men of Archenfield was committed
    the post of trust and danger. During the advance they were to form the
    ‚ÄúAuantwarde,‚Äù and in retreat the ‚ÄúRedrewarde.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Such, then, having been the antecedents of Herefordshire, it is not to
    be wondered at that it bristled with strong places, nearly all of which
    show indications of early dates, and in many may be traced the mount or
    motte, which in England there is strong reason to regard as in favour
    in the tenth century. Domesday, usually so silent as to fortresses, and
    enumerating only forty-nine in all England, mentions in this county
    eight, and two strong houses. There were, however, many more, and at
    this day there remain traces more or less considerable of twenty-eight,
    of which many preserve the mount, and others earthworks of an early
    character. Similar works are found at Brecon and Builth, places known
    to have been held by the English at an early period. No doubt these
    strongholds, originally strengthened with timber, were burned again
    and again by the insurgent Welsh; but the positions of most of them
    were well chosen, and each had its surrounding estate, so that when,
    after the Conquest, the great Norman barons marched into Wales, they
    constructed upon these sites castles of masonry after their fashion,
    of which a few remain, though many, having been destroyed, have been
    rebuilt in the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, or later.</p>

  <p>William‚Äôs arrival no doubt confirmed and extended any local power that
    may have been allowed to Richard Fitz-Scrob and his son, under Harold.
    Osborn, as sheriff, held Hereford, and either he or the first Norman
    earl probably rebuilt the castle in the Norman manner.</p>

  <p>William FitzOsborn, the great Norman chief, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Magister militum
    bellicosus</span>,‚Äù Earl of Hereford from 1067 to 1071, was a fearful scourge
    of the Welsh, whom he drove back and vanquished on the banks of
    the distant Rhymny. To him are attributed the castles of Strigwil,
    Clifford, Wigmore, and Ewias‚Äîthat is, the Norman part of them, for some
    at least preserve older earthworks.</p>

  <p>Roger de Bretuil, William‚Äôs third son, succeeded him in the earldom. He
    plays no part in the history of shire or castle. Failing in rebellion
    in the eastern counties, he ended his days in prison.</p>

  <p>When Bretuil died is unknown, but in 1138 Hereford, commanded by
    William Talbot, held out successfully against Stephen during a long
    siege. The defence was much aided by Milo, the Constable of England,
    who received the earldom of Hereford from Maud, in 1140, and it
    remained in his family till the end of the century. Milo‚Äôs patent
    gave him the moat, probably the ‚Äúmotte,‚Äù and all the castle. As earl,
    however, he was unfortunate. Stephen returned and took the castle, and
    wore his crown in state in the cathedral.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

  <p>Roger, son of Milo, was in opposition to Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, but escaped by
    the wise counsels of Foliot, the bishop. In the reign of John, a less
    discreet or bolder prelate‚ÄîGiles, Baron de Braose‚Äîunited with Llewelyn;
    but failing to bring over the men of Hereford to support him, died in
    exile. The castle seems then to have fallen into the possession of the
    Crown, and so to have remained. Prince John gave the custody of it to
    Roger Bigod, and in the sixth of his reign as king, and in the seventh
    of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, William, brother to Thomas, Lord Cantelupe, and sheriff,
    was also governor. The turbulent reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> gave value to
    the castle of Hereford. 15 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, John Fitz-Terrick and William
    de Stowe, surveyors of works at Hereford Castle, were allowed ¬£20 for
    repairing the walls. 16 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Terrick and Roger Carlton were
    surveyors of mangonels and petards within the castle. 26 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    John and Roger le Werrur were surveyors, and had spent ¬£7. 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> on
    artillery, and ¬£12. 1<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> in making a trebuchet called ‚ÄúBlythe,‚Äù and
    ¬£40. 14<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> in building a tower in the castle. 42 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the
    castle was in the hands of the sheriff, Henry de Pembridge, until the
    barons forced the king to appoint John de Grey.</p>

  <p>44 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Roger Mortimer was governor, and penetrated into Wales
    as far as Builth. He was, however, in turn attacked, and held the
    castle, though for a few weeks only, against Simon de Montford and
    Prince Llewelyn. Bishop Acqua Blanca was taken and imprisoned at
    Eardesley. Peter de Montford, the Earl‚Äôs son, had charge of the county,
    and employed its issues in the repairs of the castle. After the battle
    of Lewes, Prince Edward was a prisoner here.</p>

  <p>Edward‚Äôs escape hence has often been related. Widemarsh, whence he
    galloped off, still bears that name, and lies about a mile north of the city.</p>

  <p>During the whole of this time, from 1199, the title of Earl of Hereford
    had been borne by Henry de Bohun, whose mother was a co-heir of a
    previous earl, but neither he nor his celebrated descendants, Earls
    of Hereford and Essex, although they held Huntington Castle and the
    lordship of Brecknock, and built the Castle of Caldecot, ever seem to
    have been seized of that of Hereford, which remained in the Crown.</p>

  <p>Soon after the time of Edward‚Äôs flight, John le Werrur and William
    Valet were surveyors of works for the king, at Hereford, and charged
    ¬£45. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 10¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for repairs of the walls and of the king‚Äôs houses.
    William Capon also held lands at Marden, by the serjeantry of keeping
    the door of the castle, and this, under Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, was commuted into
    military service in the field.</p>

  <p>Possibly the castle was employed as a local treasury; for, 1 Edward
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Henry Pigot held 46 acres <i lang="la">in capite</i> by the tenure of
    transporting the king‚Äôs treasure from Hereford Castle to London. In the
    same year Richard Porter and Richard le Panner, surveyors, charged ¬£21.
    1<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for expenses and repairs of the king‚Äôs house in the castle,
    and in the next year they had fifteen oaks from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> king‚Äôs forest of
    Haywood, a mile south-west of the city, allowed for repairs.</p>

  <p>2 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Giles Berkeley, sheriff, had spent ¬£4. 15<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> in repairs,
    and in 7‚Äì8 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Roger Burghull, his successor, had spent ¬£2. 5<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>
    4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> Hugh Turberville, one of a very unruly race, had, it appeared,
    when sheriff, burnt and destroyed in the castle the king‚Äôs house, and
    certain engines of war and military stores, to the value of ¬£100. For
    this he had a pardon, November 5, 48 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>; but the debt remained,
    and, 9 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, the sheriff was ordered to distrain upon his goods.</p>

  <p>12 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, a new chapel was erected in the castle, and the barons of
    the exchequer, by the king‚Äôs precept, allowed Roger de Burghull ¬£10.
    6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> on that account. 15 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Henry de Solers, a Herefordshire
    man, had charge of the castle, with arms and stores. 32 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>,
    Miles Pychard charged 40 marks for repairs, which were disallowed
    because not certified by the surveyor. John de Acton was governor, 33
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p>1 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Alan Plukenet, keeper of the king‚Äôs forest of Haywood,
    was to allow twelve oaks and stone for the repairs of the castle walls
    and towers. Ralph Freeman held lands <i lang="la">in capite</i>, in Fromyngton,
    by the service of carrying the cord round the castle walls when they
    were measured. 5 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, he paid half a mark for his relief, and
    commuted future payments for 7<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> per week. 10 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Hugh de
    Hacluyt charged ¬£5 for repairs.</p>

  <p>13 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Sheriff Richard Walwyn charged ¬£6. 13<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for repairs.
    At the close of the reign the queen held a great council at Hereford,
    and Hugh le Despenser, the younger, was hanged upon a tall gibbet,
    outside Friar‚Äôs Gate. During the reign of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Wales was loyal,
    and Hereford, therefore, neglected. John of Gaunt was its governor,
    1 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, but even his great love of building was not exercised
    here. As late as 8 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, the city had a grant of timber to replace
    the wall where wanting.</p>

  <p>The castle lay unnoticed, and more or less of a ruin for some
    centuries, until it became the scene of one of the struggles between
    Charles and his people. It was first seized by Sir William Waller
    for the Parliament in 1643, with the city, then also walled, and the
    position of which is naturally strong. He retired from it before Prince
    Maurice, but shortly afterwards, without stroke of sword, recovered
    possession, again to retire, so that in 1644 it was still held by the
    king. In 1645, however, its troubles began in good earnest. Leslie
    and the Scots laid regular siege to it, and from the south of the Wye
    opened a destructive fire upon the castle, cathedral, and bishop‚Äôs
    palace. Sir Barnabas Scudamore, with eleven guns, held out stoutly,
    beat off an attempt at a storm, and forced the enemy to be content
    with a blockade. As the mills without the walls were destroyed, others
    were extemporised within them. The Scots then encamped on Burtonshaw
    Meads, close under the castle, between it and the river. Scudamore,
    whose defences were out of repair, and his garrison weak, sent out for
    country folks to assist as workmen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> The enemy found this out, and,
    entering under the guise of workmen, succeeded in taking the place.
    Much injury was then done to the public buildings, and the castle, as
    belonging to the Crown, and a ruin, was sold about 1652, for the value
    of the materials.</p>

  <h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE DEFENCES.</h3>

  <p>The castle of Hereford was one of the strongest, most advanced, and
    most important fortresses upon the Welsh March, and one which, being
    posted in a very fertile and open district, was peculiarly offensive
    to, and very liable to the attacks of, the Welsh people. The present
    remains are not inconsiderable, but, as is often the case with
    fortresses of pre-Norman date, they are confined chiefly to earthworks,
    and include but slight traces of the later defences of masonry.</p>

  <p>The castle was placed upon the left or northern bank of the Wye, east
    of and below the city bridge, the cathedral, and in some measure the
    city, of which it occupied the south-eastern corner. Though excluded
    from the city liberties, it is, in common with the city, covered at
    some distance by a steep slope, at the foot of which lies the Yazor
    brook, which, rising far off to the west beyond Kentchester, and the
    remains of Magna Castra, supplied the broad tract of lowland still
    known as Forster‚Äôs Moor, Moorfield, Canon‚Äôs Moor, Prior‚Äôs Moor, Eastern
    Moor, Moor Barn, and Widemarsh, to the north-west of the city, and
    which, after skirting its north front below Baron Court, turns Monkmoor
    and Scult Mills, and finally falls into the Wye, at Eigne Mill, some
    traces of which remain about half a mile in advance of, and below the
    castle. The ground thus included is to the north-east, a broad and
    dry platform of gravel, very fertile, and probably employed as a safe
    pasture in wild times. The lower tract to the north-west, now drained,
    and either cultivated or built upon, must, in former days, have been an
    almost impracticable morass.</p>

  <p>The city of Hereford, within its walls, was, in plan, about
    three-fourths of an irregular circle, placed upon the Wye, which forms
    its concave chord. Its dimensions were, north and south, 600 yards;
    east and west, 770 yards; and along the river bank, about 600 yards;
    including the cathedral and the castle. The total girth was about 2,350
    yards. The walls‚Äîno doubt Norman‚Äîupon the older lines, were confined
    to the landward sides, excepting about 50 yards above the city bridge,
    and were in length about a mile and a quarter. They were pierced by six
    gates‚ÄîWye Bridge, removed in 1782; Friar‚Äôs Gate and Eigne, on the west,
    removed in 1787; Widemarsh Gate and Bye or Bishop‚Äôs Gate, towards the
    north, removed in 1798; and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew‚Äôs or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Owen‚Äôs Gate, on the
    east, removed in 1786.</p>

  <p>The walls were reinforced by fifteen hollow mural towers, placed from
    75 yards to 125 yards apart, or at a ‚Äúflyte shoot,‚Äù‚Äîexplained to be
    within 400 yards, and here much less. They were rather more than half
    round‚Äîthat is to say, their side walls were a little pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>longed or
    stilted in plan, and they were 34 feet high, having a cruciform loop in
    front, and probably two others laterally. Of these, two at least remain
    and are accessible, though their upper half has been removed. The
    intervening curtain was 16 feet high on the interior, but it was built
    against the old English bank, which thus covered the lower 6 feet of
    the interior face, and served as a ramp. Besides the two towers already
    mentioned, which stood on the north-west face, the wall may be traced
    along the western side from Bishop‚Äôs Gate‚Äînow ‚Äúthe Commercial Road‚Äù‚Äîto
    the river bank. Where it has been pulled down the step remains, and
    the difference between the level within and without is brought to
    view. Of this wall the part from the Friar‚Äôs Gate to the river is open
    to view from the exterior paddock. The ditch has been partly filled
    up, but the wall remains about 12 feet high, unaltered, save by the
    removal of its upper 4 feet or 6 feet. At regular intervals along it
    of about 50 feet are broad pilaster buttresses, of slight projection,
    and without sets-off. These die into the wall below its present top.
    There do not appear to have been any mural towers on this part of
    the wall. Some kind of manufactory conceals the termination of this
    wall upon the river, where there was probably a tower; and from this
    point to the bridge a line of modern houses effectually conceals any
    foundations that may have escaped. The tracing out the town wall, or
    what remains of it, though aided by parallel streets, representing the
    rampart within and the ditch without, is a delicate operation; for the
    lowest houses of the city are here found, and the inhabitants seem to
    drive the trade of those who, at Jericho, dwelt in a similar locality.
    That part of the wall showing the pilasters is, no doubt, the original
    Norman wall. The part beyond, or, at least, the towers upon it, is
    probably of the time of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> The wide modern street, called
    Commercial Road, which takes the place of the old Bishop‚Äôs Gate, has,
    of course, caused the removal of all traces of the wall near the site
    of the gate; but the line may still be traced round the eastern quarter
    of the city as far as the angle of the castle. Here, as before, are two
    roads‚Äîone inside and one outside the line of the wall‚Äîthe actual place
    of which is shown, sometimes by a few stones built into the walls of
    later houses, and sometimes by a dip of nearly 6 feet in level. Beyond
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Owen‚Äôs Gate the actual wall remains for some yards, and may be seen
    from the exterior road. It extends to the counterscarp of the castle
    ditch, where it ends abruptly, having been in part pulled down.</p>

  <p>The city bridge crosses the Wye by six arches, round headed, and
    all apparently old. One is stiffened with three plain square ribs,
    and another shows traces of a similar addition. The bridge has bold
    piers, and advantage has been taken of this to widen it by turning a
    subsidiary arch, about 5 feet wide, on each face, so that the old work
    is partially concealed. It does not appear where the fortified gateway
    was placed; probably upon the last narrow arch on the city side. This
    does not, indeed, show any trace of having been perforated for a
    drawbridge, and tradition places the gate at the outer end.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

  <p>Next to and a little below the bridge, near the river bank, and a
    little south of the centre of the city, stands the cathedral, and below
    and next to it the castle.</p>

  <p>Besides the cathedral and its appendage of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs, there stood
    within the walls four churches‚Äî<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas‚Äôs, All Saints‚Äô, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Peter‚Äôs, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Owen‚Äôs. There was also <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin‚Äôs, beyond the
    Wye, destroyed during the civil wars. The disposition of the streets
    is irregular, and in no way cruciform or indicative of any Roman
    arrangement. Thus situated and defended, Hereford was a very strong
    place, as it had need to be, for it was exposed to the fierce and
    repeated attacks of the Welsh, who especially resented, as was natural,
    the conquest of their most fertile provinces by the invaders.</p>

  <p>The castle, as has been said, occupied the south-eastern quarter of the
    city. It lay in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John. Leland describes it as one of
    the fairest, largest, and strongest castles in England.</p>

  <p>It was composed of two wards placed side by side along the bank of
    the Wye, not actually on the stream, which, when the defences were of
    earth, might have undermined them; but about 7 yards distant from and
    on the edge of a steep sloping bank, about 8 feet above the water.</p>

  <p>In general plan the eastern ward was an oblong, the sides being nearly
    straight, and the east end narrower than the west. The eastern end runs
    at right angles to the river, and measures along the old line of its
    wall 100 yards. The south or river front measured 175 yards, as did the
    north front. The west front, connecting the two, measured 196 yards.
    This inclosure formed the eastern or lower ward, and contained about
    26,000 square yards.</p>

  <p>The upper or western ward was applied to the end of the eastern,
    and like it rested on the river. In form it was rounded, or rather
    irregularly polygonal, and composed of a large conical mound, wholly
    artificial, with a circular circumscribing ditch. Within the ditch it
    measured, on the east and south sides, each 100 yards, and, on the
    three remaining sides, 60 yards each. It was, therefore, in girth about
    380 yards, and in area about 14,000 yards. Thus the area of the whole
    castle, ditches included, might be about 8¬º acres. The eastern ward is
    stated to have contained about 5¬Ω acres.</p>

  <p>The earthworks of the lower ward are tolerably perfect. They are
    composed of a steep bank along the north and east sides, from 15 feet
    to 30 feet high, the highest and broadest part being at the north-east
    angle, where there was probably a tower. This bank has evidently been
    thrown up out of a broad and deep ditch, which remains perfect and full
    of water, on the north front; but has recently been filled up along the
    east as far as the river; nor do there remain any traces of the castle
    mill, which stood at its junction with the river. The ground is raised
    along the river front about 4 feet, and may have been higher. Along the
    west or side towards the upper ward, the bank has been thrown into the
    ditch, and there is only a trace of either. Leland says there was ‚Äúa
    great bridge of stone arches, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> a drawbridge in the middle of it to
    enter into the castle;‚Äù but even in Leland‚Äôs time this was gone.</p>

  <p>The entrance to this ward was evidently at its north-west angle, where
    the moat is crossed by a causeway, and the public now enter. There was
    a gatehouse in Speed‚Äôs time, which he places, probably by an error of
    drawing, near the middle of this face. But the bank is there far too
    high, and the ditch far too deep and broad, to allow of the entrance
    being placed there.</p>

  <p>The modern museum, built on the river at the south-west angle of the
    ward, or rather between the two wards, and over the line of the ditch,
    contains some parts of an older building, and a doorway of the time of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> This building probably guarded the opening of
    the middle ditch into the river, and was also the gatehouse between the
    two wards. Speed shows a sort of water-gate here, which is probable
    enough. The surface of the lower ward is level. In it stood the chapel
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert, with a semicircular apse, and in Speed‚Äôs time also two
    small dwelling-houses. Leland says, ‚ÄúThere is a fayre and plentifull
    spring of water in the castell, and that, and the piece of the brook
    coming out of the ditch, did drive a mill within the castle.‚Äù This was
    in addition to the mill outside and north of the castle, and probably
    was a part of the present museum-house.</p>

  <p>The earthworks of the upper ward have unfortunately been destroyed,
    the mound and banks thrown into the ditches, and all made level and
    much built over. The site of the mound is occupied by an enclosed
    three-cornered kitchen garden. The well or spring spoken of as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Ethelred‚Äôs remains. It opens behind the museum building about 50 feet
    from the river, and 6 feet or 8 feet above it. As it is described as
    being further north, it is probable that when the ditch was filled up a
    pipe was laid to bring the water out at its original level. This ward
    contained the mound known as the Castle Hill, and which seems to have
    been removed early in the present century. It was girded at the base
    by a polygonal curtain wall, outside of which was the ditch. It is
    difficult clearly to understand how the mound was occupied. Leland says
    ‚Äúthere was one great tower in the inner warde.‚Äù Sir Henry Slingsby, in
    his diary, in 1645, describes Hereford city as not much unlike York,
    ‚Äúfor it hath a round tower mounted upon a hill, like to Clifford‚Äôs
    Tower, and the mills near it, with some little works about, having the
    river Wye running close by; but the walls, though they be high, yet
    are not mounted upon a ramp, as York walls are.‚Äù This is intelligible
    enough, the walls spoken of having been at the base of the hill; but
    Leland speaks also of a donjon or keep, of what plan is unknown; but
    upon its wall ten half-round towers, and within, what appears to have
    been a square tower of considerable height, in the base of which was a
    dungeon. We may safely conclude from Sir Henry Slingsby‚Äôs very clear
    account that the mound carried, like Cardiff and Kilpeck, a shell keep;
    but this could scarcely have been furnished with ten half-round towers.
    These probably belonged to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall below. The keep
    was entered, it seems, from the south-east side by a flight of steep
    steps up the mound. In the mound was a well, lined with stone, as at
    York.</p>

  <p>The castle ditches were wide, deep, and filled with water, not from
    the river, or but partially so, but from a brook, which seems to have
    fed the city ditch on this side, and on reaching the castle at the
    north-east angle to have divided, a part running direct along the east
    front of the lower ward, to the river, and the other part supplying the
    north ditch, and the ditch which divided the upper from the lower ward,
    and the ditch which passed round the east side of the ward, and divided
    it from the cathedral precinct. This latter ditch also received some
    little contribution from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ethelred‚Äôs Well, a spring on the north
    side of the upper ward, already mentioned. The castle mill stood at the
    junction of the eastern ditch with the Wye. The water in the castle
    ditches was, of course, penned back for the use of the mill, and to
    strengthen the defences, and it seems to have flowed back upon the city
    ditch as far as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Owen‚Äôs Gate, thus strengthening and connecting the
    city and the castle.</p>

  <p>We have, then, to recapitulate, as the constituent parts of Hereford
    Castle, an oblong space, with the river on one side, and high banks
    and ditches on the other three. One end was cut off from the rest, and
    had its proper ditch, more or less circular, and within it a conical
    mound, with a table summit, and upon it a shell keep, with some kind of
    central tower, probably an addition. At the base of the mound, within
    its ditch, was a second wall, many sided in plan.</p>

  <p>The lower ward, no doubt, had its walls along the summit of the
    earthworks, and these probably were low, by reason of the height of
    the bank and the depth of the ditch beyond. There was a gatehouse at
    the land entrance at the north-west angle, and a water-gate at the
    south-western, where also was the passage between the two wards. Very
    likely there was a postern at the south-eastern angle, where is now a
    footway.</p>

  <p>There is a general resemblance, as regards the mound and bank, between
    these arrangements and those at Wallingford, Wareham, and Tamworth, and
    with what is related of the castle of Worcester.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="HERTFORD_CASTLE">HERTFORD CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Castle of Hertford not only is of high antiquity, but the date
    of its foundation is on record. The Saxon Chronicle relates that in
    the year 913, Edward the Elder, son of Alfred, threw up two Burhs
    at Hertford, one at Martinmas, on the north bank of the river, and,
    later on, one on the south bank, between three of the rivers which
    here unite. The former of these works has long been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> laid low, and
    no trace of it is visible, but the latter has been preserved by its
    incorporation into the later castle. The mound, standing on the edge
    of the river Lea, is indeed shorn of its original dimensions, but it
    remains, and attached to it is the base court with its exterior ditch,
    once of great breadth and depth, the invariable accompaniment of the
    mound, and with it constituting the Burh.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_120">
    <div class="caption smcap">Hertford</div>
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_120.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>Edward‚Äôs Burhs may have been preceded by an earlier earthwork, for
    Hertford is reputed to stand on the site of a chief town of the
    Trinobantes, the British occupants of the district north of this
    part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> of the Thames. The Britons, however, if they here established a
    stronghold, are more likely to have placed it upon one of the adjacent
    heights, where are several excellent positions for an entrenchment.
    Probably the existence of a British settlement in a neighbourhood so
    well protected by its watercourses attracted the invading settlers, for
    here the East Saxon kings are said to have had a residence, and to this
    place Archbishop Theodore, consecrated in 668, convened a synod of the
    national Church in 673.</p>

  <p>The Danes overran this part of England more than once, and the camp at
    Danesbury was probably their work. Also, they are thought to have had
    a camp upon Port Hill, of which, however, it is said that no traces
    are now to be seen. It was upon the river Lea, between Hertford and
    Waltham, that Alfred rendered the Danish fleet useless by blocking up
    the river, and so preventing their return. It is on record that this
    was effected, not by actually throwing a dam across the stream, but by
    the far more scientific process of cutting a number of channels for its
    waters, each too shallow to allow the vessels to float down. By this
    means the retreat of the Danes to the Thames was cut off, and they were
    fain to march inland to the Severn at Bridgenorth.</p>

  <p>In 913 the protection afforded by the Hertford Burhs seems to have
    attracted inhabitants, who occupied both banks of the river Lea, and
    the town thus situate was raised by Edward into a royal Burgh, held of
    the Crown by burgage tenure. Hertford was so held of the Confessor, and
    so accepted by the Conqueror, and entered in Domesday, which, however,
    as was not uncommon, makes no mention of the castle, nor, indeed, of
    the churches. William is said to have strengthened the castle, and he
    gave it in charge to Peter de Valoignes, one of his followers, who
    transmitted it to his son Roger, and he to his two sons in succession,
    Peter and Robert. The male line closed with Robert, whose daughter
    and heiress, Gunnora de Valoignes, married Robert Fitz-Walter. The
    charge of the castle does not seem to have descended, but to have been
    resumed, possibly as a male fief, by the Crown.</p>

  <p>King John, that most erratic of monarchs, held the castle, and visited
    it in 1212, 1213, and 1216. In this latter year, however, it was
    attacked by Lewis of France, who laid siege to it from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin‚Äôs
    (November 11) to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas‚Äôs Day (December 6), and finally took
    it. Robert Fitz-Walter, an adherent of Lewis, took the opportunity to
    revive his wife‚Äôs claim, but without success. It was finally recovered
    by John, and transmitted to his son Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, who placed Richard de
    Argentin in charge of it, and expended ¬£20, and probably other sums,
    in its repairs. In 1226 it was held by Hubert de Burgh, on whose fall
    Henry granted it to be held <i lang="fr">in capite</i> by William de Valence,
    after whom it was held by his son, Aymer, Earl of Pembroke.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> resumed possession in 1327, and granted the castle to
    John of Gaunt, his son, from whom it finally passed into the Duchy
    of Lancaster, to which it is nominally attached. Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> kept
    his Easter here in 1429, and Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr> continued to appoint a
    constable and a porter. It is described as ‚Äú<span lang="la">castrum non immensum sed
    pulcherrimum</span>.‚Äù Hertford fared better than most royal castles, possibly
    from its convenient position as regarded London, for in the reign of
    Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> it contained lodgings suitable for the king, and Edward
    <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> and the Princess Elizabeth were both here. By the latter, when
    queen, it was alienated to Sir William Harrington, who built a large
    brick house on the site of the inner gatehouse, which still remains.
    In the time of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the castle is described as covering 7¬æ acres.
    The ditch then extended to the roads or streets now known as the Mill
    Bridge, the Wash, and Castle Street. The mill was upon the Lea just
    below the castle mounds. The Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew stands about 150
    yards from the remaining mound, beyond the river. There was a second
    mill, probably that on the river above the castle. The castle was
    finally leased to Mr. Secretary Cecil, in whose descendant, the Marquis
    of Salisbury, it remains. It is remarkable that Hertford Castle at no
    time belonged to the earls who bore the title of Hertford. They were,
    of course, earls of the county, though this is not specified in the
    peerages. Their principal eastern seat was at Clare in Suffolk, round
    which they possessed considerable property.</p>

  <p>The strength of Hertford as a military position was very great, and
    depended upon the low marshy ground by which it was almost surrounded,
    and which was liable to be flooded by the waters of three, or rather
    four, considerable streams, ‚Äú<span lang="la">flumina non profunda sed clarissima</span>.‚Äù Of
    these, the Lea, flowing from the west, received, a few yards above
    the castle, the Mimram from the north-west, while a little below the
    castle the combined stream is swollen by the waters of the Beane from
    the north, and the Rib from the north-east, the combined volume flowing
    forward under the name of the Lea. Below, or south-west of the castle,
    along the course of the Lea, is a wide breadth of lowland, which even
    now is occasionally flooded, and which in former days must have been an
    impracticable morass. In the other direction the ground, though built
    upon and forming a part of the town, is for some distance around but
    little higher than the meadow, though here and there, elevated 4 feet
    or 5 feet, appear small deposits of gravel. The castle stands upon the
    right bank, south-east of the river, and its extreme limit, within
    the counterscarp or outer edge of its main ditch, included a space
    something in the figure of an ear, the river forming the shorter side
    or concavity. In length, north-east and south-west, this space measures
    234 yards; its breadth varies from 100 yards to 200 yards, with a mean
    of 140 yards. The ditch, now almost filled up and in part built over,
    was about 30 yards broad, and no doubt filled from the river with which
    it communicated at each end. Within the ditch, taking the line of the
    old bank, or of the present wall, the area is about three and a half or
    four acres. The mound is placed on the edge of the river, at the north
    angle of the enclosure. The bank does not include it, but points to its
    centre, so that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> mound, as was not unusual, formed a part of the
    enclosing defence. The proper ditch of the mound has been filled up.</p>

  <p>Of the medi√¶val castle there remains only a considerable part of the
    wall of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, and, it may be, some ancient masonry built
    up into Sir William Harrington‚Äôs house, which is still inhabited. This
    is said to have been the gatehouse; if so, it was that of the northern
    ward, and was upon the line of the wall dividing the one ward from the
    other. The curtain wall is about 7 feet thick, and 25 feet to 30 feet
    high, and composed of flint rubble. The battlement is gone or nearly
    so, and there remains but a part of one mural tower, circular in plan,
    which capped the south-east angle of the wall of the northern ward. The
    wall covers the northern and most of the eastern sides of the area.
    There is no trace of it along the western or river side. No doubt it
    was less substantial on that side, upon which the natural defence was
    strong. The south or smaller ward does not appear to have been walled
    in. It was covered on the three sides by the river and the marsh, and
    may have been palisaded only. The wall evidently crossed the ditch of
    the mound, and abutted upon it, or possibly upon the shell keep, all
    vestiges of which are gone.</p>

  <p>The present entrance to the castle is at the eastern angle of the
    ditch, which is traversed by a road leading to a small and apparently
    modern doorway in the wall. There is no trace of a main entrance in
    this direction, but it must be confessed that if the main entrance lay
    to the south of the gatehouse, it must have been difficult to approach,
    save by water.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="HOPTON_CASTLE_SHROPSHIRE">HOPTON CASTLE, SHROPSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ABOUT five miles south-east of Clun, upon a tributary of the Teme, is
    placed the parish and castle of Hopton, the Opetune of Domesday, when
    it was, like Clun, held by Picot as the successor of Edric. It was a
    fief of Clun. In 1165 it was held by Walter de Opton as two knights‚Äô
    fees under Geoffrey de Vere, one of the three husbands of Isabel de
    Say; and Peter de Opton held it in 1201. William de Hopton may have
    followed, but Mr. Eyton is not clear whether he may not have been of
    Monk-Hopton in the same county.</p>

  <p>However this may be, Walter de Hopton held the fief in 1223, as did
    another Walter, 1255‚Äì72, and was bound to provide for the defence of
    Clun Castle one soldier all the year round, and a second for forty
    days in time of war. In 1304‚Äì5, upon the death of Walter de Hopton, he
    was seized of the Vill of Hopton with its hamlets, and a considerable
    property about it, chiefly held under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> Clun, as continued to be the
    original two fees, by Sir John de Hopton, in the 21 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> The
    family seems to have remained at Hopton till the reign of Elizabeth,
    but the castle was still standing and of sufficient strength to be
    held for King Charles in the seventeenth century. It was taken after a
    gallant resistance, and dismantled.</p>

      Scale‚Äî¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ inch = 1 foot.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Hopton Castle or Tower stands about half a mile south of the parish
    church. It occupies a knoll or patch of gravel, which rises out of
    a marshy bottom, caused by the waters of the brooks which here fall
    into the main stream. There is a central mound, low but well defined,
    which is surrounded by a circular ditch, and beyond this ditch are the
    traces of two or three platforms, but slightly elevated, and which
    have been fortified by ditches fed with water by a streamlet from the
    west. No doubt the place was occupied by some tenant of Edric, for its
    earthworks are certainly pre-Norman, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> perhaps of the tenth century.
    It is probable that its Norman tenant and his descendants, who derive
    their names from the place, were for some centuries content with such
    defences as they found ready to their hands, for there is no trace of
    masonry, either of the eleventh or twelfth centuries.</p>

  <p>The castle consists of a single tower, quadrangular, 48 feet by 50
    feet, with walls 10 feet thick. It stands upon the mound, which is
    not above 6 feet high, and through which the foundations are no doubt
    carried. It has a basement at the ground level, a first or main floor,
    and an attic in the roof. The exterior is plain, having a double-scroll
    stringcourse from 4 feet to 6 feet from the ground. Each angle is
    capped by a pair of broad pilasters of slight projection, which ascend
    to the summit, and probably carried four square turrets. The doorway
    is on the north side, not far from its west end, and nearly at the
    ground-floor level, ascended from the exterior by three or four steps.
    The south front has a square projection at its west end, in which is a
    garderobe. The doorway, the only entrance, is 6 feet wide, and has an
    equilateral arched head. Its mouldings are two convex quarter circles
    divided by a step. Their character is plain but excellent Decorated.
    Over the doorway was a triangular hood, now broken away. There is no
    portcullis, only a strong door.</p>

  <p>Entering, a vaulted passage leading to the basement has a small door on
    the right, which leads into a well-stair, 6 feet in diameter, occupying
    the north-west angle of the building, and ascending to the roof. At
    the first floor is a lobby, with a small window above the outer door.
    This is the only staircase. The basement chamber is 29 feet by 21
    feet. In the north wall is a deep recess, 7 feet wide, containing a
    small square-headed loop. Opposite, in the south wall, is a similar
    recess and window, but in the jambs are two doors, which by short
    passages lead into two chambers in the two southern angles. That in the
    south-east angle is 7 feet by 6 feet, with two loops. The other is a
    garderobe, with one loop. Both are covered in with overhanging slabs.
    In the west side is another window, in a recess, similar to those above
    described, and a fireplace with a vertical tunnel. In the east wall are
    two recesses, one blank and one pierced with a loop. From the jamb of
    this latter a door opens into a small chamber in the north-east angle.</p>

  <p>The first floor is lofty. The joists and boards are gone, and the walls
    and window recesses are so thick with brambles and so inaccessible
    that the details are not to be seen. This floor seems to resemble the
    basement, save that it is higher, and the windows are larger.</p>

  <p>The remains of two gables in the north and south fronts show that there
    was a ridge roof, with a small window at each end. Altogether this is
    a very peculiar building, much more like a Scottish than an English
    castle. It is all of one date, probably the work of Walter de Hopton,
    who died in 1304‚Äì5, and seems to have been a man of considerable wealth
    and power.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="HUNTINGDON_CASTLE">HUNTINGDON CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT has generally been supposed that the town of Godmanchester, upon the
    right bank of the Ouse, represents the Roman station of Durolipons. It
    is traversed by the Ermine Street, which here receives the Via Devana
    from Cambridge, and another Roman road from the station at Salen√¶,
    or Sandy. The Roman town, however, seems, as was often the case, to
    have been destroyed in the centuries of war that followed on the
    departure of the Roman armies, and its memory is chiefly preserved in
    the termination of ‚ÄúChester‚Äù suffixed to its later name. The northern
    invaders did not much care to build upon or employ Roman foundations,
    and in this case they passed over from the low and watery side of the
    old station and established themselves on the higher position of the
    Hunters, or Hunting-down, on the opposite, or left and northern, bank
    of the river. By whom, or precisely when, the capital of the future
    county was founded is not known. The first mention of it, or rather of
    Huntingdon Port, in history, is in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 657, when it occurs in
    the foundation limits of Medehampstede (Peterborough). As a military
    post it is named in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 918, when, according to the Saxon
    Chronicle, the Danish army from Huntingdon and East Anglia threw up a
    work at Tempsford, and for it deserted another at Huntingdon. That work
    must necessarily be the earthworks now remaining, which may either have
    been thrown up by the Danes or by earlier Saxons. Later in the year,
    King Eadweard with his West Saxons brought the Danes of Northampton and
    Welland to obedience, ‚Äúreduced the burgh at Huntingdon, and repaired
    and renovated it, where it was before in a state of ruin.... And all
    the folk that were left there of the peasantry submitted to King
    Eadweard, and sought his peace and his protection.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Henry, Archdeacon of Huntingdon, who wrote towards the close of the
    eleventh century, mentions the three burhs (<i lang="la">tria castra</i>) of
    Buckingham, Bedford, and Huntingdon. The castle is mentioned several
    times in Domesday. It was within the borough of Huntingdon. The
    Bishop of Lincoln had a residence (<i lang="la">mansio</i>) in the place of
    the castle (<i lang="la">in loco castri</i>). In the place of the castle were
    twenty residences (<i lang="fr">mansiones</i>). ‚ÄúBesides these were and are <abbr title="40">LX.</abbr>
    ‚Äòmansiones‚Äô waste ... and on account of these are <abbr title="8">VIII.</abbr> ‚Äòmansiones‚Äô
    waste.‚Äù William the Conqueror was at Huntingdon 1068, when he ordered a
    castle to be built, evidently on the site of the old fortress restored
    by Edward the Elder in 918. The names in Domesday show how complete
    had been the removal of the larger English landowners. The new castle
    was probably built by, and in the hands of, Eustace, one of the most
    rapacious of the Norman sheriffs; but the earldom was given to Judith,
    the king‚Äôs niece, and descended to and through Maud, her daughter, by
    Earl Waltheof. Maud married,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> first, Simon de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Liz, in her right
    Earl of Huntingdon. The earldom, on his death, was held by David,
    afterwards King of Scots, Maud‚Äôs second husband, and, with the castle,
    was long a subject of contention between the two families, until David,
    the third son of Henry, son of Maud and David, laid siege to and took
    the castle, on which Simon de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Liz, the son of Maud, retook it.
    The result was that Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> had the castle demolished, nor does it
    appear ever to have been rebuilt. The town occurs from time to time in
    the public records, and the honour remained attached to the earldom.
    The king also had a prison there; but there is never any allusion to
    a castle. In 1205 King John granted to Robert Rufus the demesne and
    mill at Huntingdon, and in 1218 and 1219 the sheriff had order to give
    seizin, under certain limitations, to Alexander, King of Scotland, as
    custos of the honour. The junior branch of the house of Hastings took
    the title of Huntingdon, to commemorate the descent of the elder line
    from the Scottish earls.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to suppose that Henry would, within a century of its
    construction, demolish a first-class castle, commanding a shire town,
    and posted upon the edge of a very strong and inaccessible tract of
    country. The usual course with an important structure was to attach
    it to the Crown. And yet, whatever stood there was certainly then
    demolished, and Huntingdon Castle is not again heard of. Was there
    really a castle built there, or was it, as was often the case, a mere
    strengthened form of the older English work in timber? It is difficult,
    after this lapse of time, to say, though an excavation judiciously
    conducted would no doubt set the question at rest.</p>

  <p>There does not appear to be any plan of Huntingdon Castle, that is,
    of the earthworks known as Castle Hill, which still are seen; and as
    they are extensive and partly included within a private garden, a mere
    handsketch is scarcely practicable. The position is a fine one. The
    Ouse, here deep, broad, and sluggish, in its way from Bedford and Eaton
    to the Fens, recedes from the higher land to the northward, and makes,
    between Huntingdon and Godmanchester, a bold curve to the south; thus
    enclosing a grand circle of meadow about half a mile in diameter, and
    now used as the racecourse. Along the northern edge of this breadth
    of sward flows the Alconbury brook, a considerable watercourse, which
    skirts the foot of the high land, and joins the Ouse opposite the
    Castle Hill, and just above the bridge by which the Ermine Street is
    carried across the river. Here, upon the edge of the high land, and
    protected from the south by the river and the brook, and the low and
    formerly impassable levels beyond them, are the ancient earthworks,
    which, though partially levelled, and reduced both in height and depth,
    and traversed by a road and a railway, are still very considerable,
    and form a remarkable feature in the view of the town from the south.
    In general outline the work is rather a circle than a square, and
    about 180 yards in clear diameter. The outer ditch, which is included
    in this measurement, encircles two-thirds of the whole, communicating
    at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> each end with the brook, which thus completes the investment. Upon
    the western margin of the area thus enclosed, and projecting boldly
    into it, is a large mound, the flat top of which, now crowned by a
    neglected mill, is 100 feet diameter, and about 30 feet high above the
    inner platform, and 40 feet or more above the country outside. This
    mound, which was the citadel of the work, had its proper surrounding
    ditch, which at the outer face was identified with the main ditch, but
    elsewhere cut off the mound from the general area of the fortress.
    This remainder, which, by the indentation of the mound and ditch
    cutting out a huge cantle, was converted into a sort of crescent, was
    defended along its outer edge by broad and high banks of earth, perhaps
    20 feet above the contained area, and 30 feet or 40 feet above the
    circumscribing ditch. The railway passes east and west, close south of
    the mound, and cuts off a part of the work; the road passes north of
    the mound; and north of this a close fence shuts off from the visitors
    a part of the earthwork.</p>

  <p>The entrance was on the east, or town side. Towards the west, outside
    the ditch, is a natural elevated platform, which, at 100 yards
    distance, terminates in a steep slope, and which may have been a part
    of the defences, or perhaps a safe penfold for cattle. There was a mill
    mentioned in Domesday, upon the river below the castle. There is now no
    trace of masonry above ground, but the earthworks look as though they
    had been built upon.</p>

  <p>The two town churches are handsome. One seems, except perhaps the
    tower, wholly Perpendicular; the other contains some Norman or early
    English work, with much of Decorated work, and some of Tudor date. Near
    the George Hotel are two large round-headed arches springing from three
    fine Norman piers. The building to which they belong has been rebuilt,
    or nearly so, in brick. There is said to have been a hospital here.</p>

  <p>Although the evidence is, on the whole, in favour of the English origin
    of these earthworks, and of those at Eaton-Socon, the mound at Eaton
    does not form so important a feature as usual in the burhs of the tenth
    century, although it is nevertheless present. But both these works
    present a feature which is, independently of the mound, very common in
    works of their class, and very uncommon in those of admitted British
    or Roman origin. Not only is there a mound, but the level of the area
    contained within the inner ditches is generally higher than the land
    immediately around. This is remarkably so at Builth and Kilpeck, among
    many other places, and was apparently intended to give the domestic
    buildings greater safety and an advantage when actually attacked. This
    distinction does not seem to have been pointed out, and it is possible
    that upon it may turn the identification of many of the earthworks, the
    date of which is now unknown.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CASTLE_OF_KENILWORTH_WARWICKSHIRE">THE CASTLE OF KENILWORTH, WARWICKSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE three midland counties of England, happily for those who dwelt in
    them, were not rich in castles, and such as remain are rarely of a very
    striking character. The position of Belvoir, indeed, is very noble, and
    Warwick stands without a rival; but these are brilliant exceptions,
    and the early castle-builders of the shires of Leicester, Warwick, and
    Northampton, in the absence of those wilder features of nature to which
    many of the Welsh and Scottish fortresses owe much of their celebrity,
    had to be content with defences often wholly artificial, and, where
    natural, seldom of a bold character, though sometimes of formidable
    strength.</p>

  <p>The Castle of Kenilworth is an excellent example of a midland fortress.
    To an ordinary observer, its site presents much of quiet sylvan
    beauty, but nothing of obtrusive military strength; and yet, in the
    hands of skilful engineers, it became, in point of size, strength, and
    accommodation, one of the most important military posts in England.
    It had walls capable of great passive resistance, a capacity for
    containing a numerous garrison and immense stores of provision, and
    a front protected by a large sheet of water, which again was covered
    by a formidable outwork. Moreover the midland districts were, from an
    early period, traversed by main and cross roads, favourable to the
    concentration of troops and the transfer of stores, seldom sought
    in vain in so fertile a country. For all these qualities, strength,
    capacity, a central position, and facilities for collecting and feeding
    a garrison, there was, in the days of its pride, no fortress in England
    superior, probably none equal, to Kenilworth; and now, when its grassy
    lawns and ivy-covered walls are redolent of peace and prosperity, and
    of English rural life, the thoughtful visitor cannot but feel that the
    place was a fitting one for the conclusion of that celebrated contest
    between monarchical power and civil liberty, in which, though the
    honour and nominal victory were with the Crown, the real and permanent
    gain remained with the English people.</p>

  <p>Half-way between Warwick and Coventry, where the action of water upon
    the soft rock of the new red sandstone has wrought the surface of the
    country into an immense network of low, round-topped hills and broad
    and gentle valleys, the Inchford brook, one of the many tributaries of
    the river Sow, receives, on its left or northern bank, a smaller and
    nameless streamlet. At the point where the waters and their respective
    valleys unite, a knoll, partly of rock and partly of gravel, juts out
    from the north-east as a sort of low headland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> between the two, and is
    somewhat farther isolated by an expansion of the valley lower down,
    the general effect of which is to invest the high ground with a marshy
    frontier upon its west, south, and south-eastern slopes, leaving it
    toward the north and north-east connected with larger tracts of equally
    raised land.</p>

  <p>Such was the spot selected in remote times, probably by some wealthy
    English franklin, for a residence, and adopted by his Norman
    successors. By one or other, or possibly by both, a deep trench was
    dug across the neck of the high ground, on the north and north-east,
    and the slopes were made steeper on the other sides. The central plot,
    thus isolated, was raised artificially about 15 feet, probably from the
    surrounding excavations, and works were thus formed which may still be
    traced amidst the additions and alterations due to many generations
    of inhabitants. As usual with these concentric earthworks, the inner
    and higher part, which carried the residence of the lord, was placed
    out of centre with the outer and lower area. This was intended not
    only as an outer defence to the citadel, but as a place of security
    for the dependents, and in times of danger for the herds and flocks.
    It was important that all these should be placed near together, hence
    one or two sides of the base court were of large area, while the
    remainder was narrow and used for defence only. Such is the arrangement
    at Berkhampstead, Caerleon, Wigmore, Richard‚Äôs Castle, Tonbridge,
    Ewias-Harold, Kilpeck, Shrewsbury, and in many other fortresses where
    the Norman engineer has built upon the earlier lines, and such is the
    case at Kenilworth, where the eastern and north-eastern sides of the
    outer ward are by much the most spacious.</p>

  <p>The mound, so common in English strong places, and found at the
    adjacent fortress of Warwick, is not here distinctly visible; the
    question being, whether its site is occupied by the Norman keep or
    encroached upon by John of Gaunt‚Äôs Hall, both of which are connected
    with ancient earth-banks. A part of one of these banks is seen on the
    west front of the inner ward, and, though mutilated, may well represent
    the original burgh. The Norman keep is also connected with made ground.
    It includes within its walls a very decidedly artificial mound, from
    10 to 15 feet high, against which its walls are built. Kenilworth, as
    it now stands, is a castle of several periods, but its general plan is
    original and concentric, the principal additions having been the lake
    and the outwork beyond it. It is composed of a keep, an inner and outer
    ward, a lake now drained, a large outwork beyond the lake, and a dam
    which supported the lake, and across which lay the main approach to the
    castle.</p>

  <p>The <em>Inner Ward</em> measures about 80 yards north and south, by 84
    yards east and west. Its north-eastern angle is a right one, and its
    eastern and much of its northern sides are straight lines, but the
    southern and western sides are irregular. The keep forms and fills
    up the north-eastern angle. West of it, on the north front, are the
    kitchens, and at the north-west angle the strong tower. The west front
    is occupied by the hall, and other domestic and state buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> stand
    along the south side. Leicester‚Äôs buildings form the south-east angle,
    and Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>‚Äôs lodgings and the curtain, now gone, covered the
    remainder of the east side. In the centre was an open court, about 40
    yards north and south, by 50 yards east and west.</p>

  <p>The <em>Keep</em>, known as ‚ÄúC√¶sar‚Äôs,‚Äù and with more justice as
    ‚ÄúClinton‚Äôs Tower,‚Äù is, in magnitude, general proportions, and
    excellence of material and workmanship, a fine example of a first-class
    late Norman keep of the rectangular type. It forms the north-east angle
    of the inner ward, and is built mainly on the rock, here near the
    surface. The ground is lowest on the east and south faces, so that on
    these the base is composed of a bold battering wall from 8 to 12 feet
    high, divided into eight or ten steps, and of 6 to 8 feet projection
    at the ground line. At the top of this base, which corresponds to the
    level of the ground floor, the keep measures, from curtain to curtain,
    58 feet north and south, by 87 feet east and west, and is from the
    level about 80 feet high. Its west face is covered by the forebuilding,
    which projects 38 feet more, and is as long as the keep is broad, or
    73 feet from the front face of the turrets. The angles of the keep are
    capped by four turrets, projecting 7 feet 6 inches, and the faces of
    which are 26 feet and 22 feet, the latter to the east and west. Between
    these there are on the south face four, and on the east face three,
    pilasters, 5 to 7 feet broad, and 1 foot projection. These rise from
    the common plinth and ascend to the summit of the present wall, which
    is broken, but which includes 5 or 6 feet of parapet. It is remarkable
    that this parapet has no exterior projection, not even a stringcourse
    to mark the level of its base.</p>

  <p>The turrets are broken down nearly to the level of the curtains, but
    parts of their chambers remain. The west face is modified by the
    forebuilding. There are upon it two pilasters, but they stop at the
    level of the first floor. The turrets have an offset of 6 inches at
    two-thirds of their height, and the curtains one at a rather lower
    level. These are the only exterior reductions in the thickness of the
    wall, which is vertical. The walls, at the floor level, are 13 to 14
    feet thick, and there were two floors only‚Äîa basement and an upper or
    main floor. The basement chamber is 60 feet by 30 feet, and 20 feet
    high; the upper floor about 4 feet larger, the wall being reduced by 2
    feet, upon which shelf the floor rested. This main chamber was about 40
    feet high. The basement has lately been probed and opened. It is filled
    with made ground, varying from 6 to 15 feet deep. The walls evidently
    go through the made ground, and rest either upon the rock or on the
    original black vegetable soil. The sacrifice of so much space in so
    costly a structure is curious. It is evidently intentional, for the
    character of the masonry shows it was not meant to be seen.</p>

  <p>The north-east turret contained a well-stair 10 feet diameter, which
    ascended from the basement to the battlements, communicating with the
    first floor. It was lighted by six round-headed loops, of which three
    to the south-east remain, and open upon a chamfer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> which fills up the
    hollow angle between the turret and the east curtain. The stair seems
    to have opened below by a short bent passage in the north wall, though
    in the restoration it has been made to open into the chamber in the
    east wall. The whole north curtain is gone, from the plinth upwards,
    and has been removed with some care, its junction with the north-west
    turret being cut smooth. At the other end its removal has necessarily
    carried away half the staircase, the base of which has been entirely
    restored. This basement chamber is surrounded by a low, narrow plinth
    or step, 2 feet high and 1 foot broad. The floor was paved. In the
    south wall are three grand window recesses, round-headed, and each
    placed in a reveal about 1 foot broad and deep and square-headed. The
    arches spring from a plain abacus. They are 8 feet wide and 12 feet
    high to the springing. At present these recesses are parallel-sided,
    and open throughout. It is evident they once were deeply splayed, and
    contained small lights or loops, but the splays were cut away, and
    the loops replaced by large heavily-mullioned windows of the Tudor
    period, which windows have again been removed. In the east wall is
    a similar recess, 6 feet broad, and unaltered. Here the splay from
    outside and inside contracts in an hour-glass fashion to a loop in the
    centre of the wall, with a slight shoulder to intercept an arrow. As
    the parallel sides of the loop are 2 feet thick, and it is 6 feet from
    the face of the wall, it is clear that no arrow could be discharged
    hence save nearly straight forwards. As usual, these loops were for air
    and light, not for defence. Between this loop and the south angle is
    a square-headed door, of 3 feet opening, under a curious round-headed
    arch, of which the tympanum is partly formed by the arch stones. This
    leads to the well, which is in the centre of the wall. It is 4 feet
    diameter, and much choked up. It ascends to the upper floor. At the
    north end of this side the wall has been broken away and a small mural
    chamber laid open, 5 feet wide by 8 feet long, having a plain barrel
    vault. A door opened into it from the great chamber, and it was lighted
    by a loop, now converted into a sort of window. The inner wall about
    the doorway has been strengthened by a pilaster of 1 foot projection,
    which stops at the first floor. In the recent restoration, this chamber
    has been made the lobby at the foot of the staircase.</p>

  <p>In the west wall is a plain, round-headed doorway, of 6 feet opening,
    and with ashlar ring-stones 2 feet deep. This is the opening of a
    straight passage through the wall, here 12 feet 9 inches thick. There
    are in the passage rebates for two doors, opening towards each other.
    At Rochester, a small door in this position led only into a sort of
    prison in the base of the forebuilding, and this may have been the case
    here; but the size of the door, as at Corfe, makes it at least possible
    that it was a regular entrance, approached through the forebuilding
    from the common exterior door. In small keeps the basement was often
    entered from the first floor only, as at Clitheroe, by a trap, or, in
    the larger keeps, by a well-stair, as at Middleham. Unfortunately,
    as the forebuilding is almost always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> more or less injured, it is
    impossible in most cases where there is a large basement door to say
    positively whether it was an independent entrance. There is also the
    further doubt, as at the Tower of London, Guildford, and Malling,
    whether the doorway in the basement be not a later introduction. The
    cill of this doorway is about 10 feet above the outer or main entrance
    of the forebuilding, the floor of which rises to it. Close north of
    the large doorway is a small one, of 2 feet 6 inches opening, which
    leads into a garderobe, the seat of which is corbelled out into the
    interior of the north-west turret. This interior, 10 feet 6 inches
    square, seems to have been a vast cesspit, receiving the contents of
    garderobes from each floor and from the battlements. There is no drain
    below, and the lower part of the pit contained sand, which has recently
    been removed. There is a somewhat similar pit in the keep at Ludlow,
    and one at Sherborne which resembles them. Large as this pit is for
    such a purpose, it is much smaller than the turret, the wall of which
    to the west, if solid, must be 11 feet thick. Can there be a second and
    smaller shaft in that part of the turret, not now accessible? There
    was no way from this floor to either of the southern turrets, both of
    which, at this level, were filled with earth.</p>

  <p>The main or upper floor is 34 feet by 64 feet, and was about 40 feet
    high. As the span is long for single joists, it is possible that these
    rested upon a central beam, and this upon posts; or, as no bases have
    been found, it may be that they were stiffened by struts from the
    side walls. Some traces in the ashlar of the broken staircase at the
    north-east corner seem to point to an entrance from the stair through
    the north wall, similar to that supposed below. In the south wall are
    three window recesses corresponding to those below, but of 6 feet
    opening, with segmental heads. They rest on the floor and are 12 feet
    high. Above one of these openings, on the outside, may be traced the
    head of one of the original Norman windows, which shows that it was of
    small size‚Äîprobably of 2 feet opening. These have been replaced, with
    small regard for congruity, by late Tudor windows of three lights,
    divided in the centre by a transom. In the east wall are two similar
    windows, and over the well-pipe is the well-chamber, 7 feet square,
    rudely vaulted and groined. Its floor has been relaid, but it is
    evident that the pipe ascended into this chamber, and that a pulley
    hung from the centre of the vault for the working of the bucket. In the
    south-east corner is a locker for a spare rope or tools. The entrance
    to this chamber was through the jamb of the adjacent window, but a
    second doorway has been broken direct from the great chamber. Close to
    this breach a door and bent passage lead into the south-east turret,
    where is a chamber 12 feet 6 inches by 15 feet. The floor is of earth,
    with which the turret is filled to this level. Above are traces of an
    upper chamber, entered probably by a ladder and a trap-door. There is
    no fireplace, but a loop high up in the south wall has been converted
    into a window, and a second loop remains in the east wall.</p>

  <p>The west wall of the great chamber contains two windows similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> to
    the other side‚Äîsave that they do not descend to the floor, but begin
    about 8 feet up, so as not to interfere with the forebuilding outside.
    North of these windows, in the part of the north-west turret which
    abutted on the north curtain, is a door of 3 feet opening, and 8 feet
    or 10 feet high. This is the cross section of a mural passage leading
    from the great chamber. Close south of it, in the west wall, and above
    the similar door on the ground floor, a small round-headed door leads
    into the garderobe turret. The other opening in the west wall is at its
    south end, and is the main entrance to the keep. It is a plain doorway
    of 6 feet opening, with a flat, segmental head beneath a full-centred
    arch of relief. The passage has a segmental barrel vault. It goes
    direct through the curtain, here 12 feet thick. It has no portcullis.
    In the south wall of the passage a side door opens into the south-west
    turret. This also had an original upper chamber, but below the entrance
    or first-floor level it was filled with earth; this has been removed,
    and the lower part fitted up, and windows opened in the south wall, and
    a rude door at the base, but the rough character of the masonry shows
    that the turret was originally filled up to the first-floor level.
    Dudley‚Äôs alterations converted the interior of this turret into five
    tier of rooms, the windows of which are seen in the south wall. It is
    said also to have been fitted up as a staircase.</p>

  <p>The great chamber had an open roof, the holes for the joists of
    which are seen in the southern wall. The pitch was low, almost flat,
    as is shown by the original weather-moulding in the east and west
    walls, which has been masqued by a thin interior facing, carrying a
    moulding for a roof of a rather higher pitch, all which, however,
    has disappeared under the recent repairs. This is different from
    Porchester, Rochester, and Bridgenorth, where the original pitch was
    steep. On the outside, above the windows, but much below the base
    of the parapet, is seen a row of loops, square-headed, with a plain
    chamfer, expanded below into a broad fantail. There are three of these
    in the south wall and two in the east and west, and each turret has
    besides one on each of its two outer faces. The turret loops are at a
    higher level, and this shows that the turrets themselves stood clear
    above the curtains. These apertures are curious. The loop ascended
    in the wall and opened in the base of the parapet beneath a flat,
    three-centred arch. The loops are probably original, but the parapet
    seems to have been rebuilt, either when the pitch of the roof was
    altered or in Dudley‚Äôs time. The walls are covered with ivy and in a
    dangerous condition, so that even with the aid of long ladders their
    upper part is not very accessible. There are traces of doorways opening
    from the rampart walk into the upper parts of the turrets, the floors
    of which were of timber.</p>

  <p>The forebuilding covering the entrance forms almost as remarkable a
    feature here as at Rochester or Middleham, though it has suffered much
    from alterations. It was a rectangular tower built against the west
    wall of the keep, and projecting 38 feet. Its walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> are 6 feet thick,
    bonded into and of the date of the keep. The west wall has been in
    part removed down to the plinth, but the two other walls are tolerably
    perfect. It was of two stages and about 40 feet high. The door was in
    the south wall, opening from the inner ward. It may be traced, but has
    been in part replaced by an entrance of Perpendicular date, now also
    broken away. Above the old door, 12 feet from the ground, is a plain
    Norman string. From the door a straight stair, reversed with a second
    flight, must have risen 25 feet to reach the first floor. At that
    level, over the entrance, was a chamber, of which part of the Norman
    wall remains, but which was rebuilt by Dudley, and has been nearly all
    destroyed. Here was possibly a chapel, as at Middleham. The entrance
    to the first floor of the keep opens from this level, in the curtain,
    close to the south-west turret. The doorway, like that within, is quite
    plain, and has a flat, segmental head under an arch of relief, also
    segmental, but less flat. It looks as though the lower arch had been
    inserted to carry the joists of the roof, but it is really original.
    The pitch of the roof of the forebuilding has been thrice altered, as
    is shown by the grooves cut in the wall of the turret. The flattest
    is the latest. The roofs seem to have been of the lean-to character.
    Whether there was a chamber below the stair, or whether there was a way
    at the base of the stair into the lower floor of the keep, as has been
    already pointed out, cannot now be ascertained.</p>

  <p>It would seem that in the Perpendicular period this forebuilding was
    much altered, its entrance a little shifted, and in it were placed
    several piers, 3 feet square, supporting full-centred arches, of 9
    feet span, on which the timbers of the floor above were laid. A plain
    doorway of 6 feet opening was cut in the curtain forming the north end,
    and in the exterior of the wall an alcove was formed of 13 feet span
    by 6 feet deep, having a segmental arch, and supported by three plain
    ribs with a hollow chamfer. This alcove opened upon a terrace, which
    overlooked the northern part of the outer ward, and formed a sort of
    landing and staircase, giving a descent of four or five steps from the
    door to the terrace. The object seems to have been to form a handsome
    way from the inner ward to the garden north of the keep. The piers and
    arches might be of the date of Elizabeth or James, but their mouldings
    and parts of the adjacent walls are clearly earlier, and no doubt the
    work of the Lancastrian owners, who in that case must have indulged
    in a garden. Dudley made further alterations, and a part of the south
    front of the forebuilding still bears the date of 1575, and has Italian
    ornaments.</p>

  <p>There is to be remarked in this keep, the absence of a cross wall,
    the basement filled up with earth, the unusual projection of the four
    turrets, the probably distinct entrances from the forebuilding to the
    ground and first floor, and the well-stair, nearly as large as that
    of the Tower of London. Also, there is no portcullis, and there are
    but few mural chambers or galleries. This is the more remarkable as
    the walls are unusually thick and the material excellent. Further,
    there are no fireplaces in the three remaining walls, and there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
    ornamentation of any kind, inside or outside. The keep is the only
    distinctly Norman building remaining in the inner ward, although much
    of the curtain is Norman, and more rests upon the Norman lines.</p>

  <p>It has been stated that the keep forms the north-eastern angle of the
    inner ward. The curtain abutting upon it on either face is of its own
    date. At the north-west corner the curtain forms the north wall of the
    forebuilding, and for some yards is original. At the south-east corner
    of the keep are the remains of the entrance into the inner ward. This,
    as at Bridgenorth, was a doorway in the east curtain, close to the
    keep, and, as at Bridgenorth, although the curtain has been removed, a
    part of the doorway remains. The curtain was here 11 feet thick and 21
    feet high to the rampart wall, above which were a parapet and rear wall
    of about 5 feet more. One whole jamb and the springing-stones of the
    portal remain. There was no gatehouse, only an opening in the wall, as
    at Ogmore, and probably at Ludlow. The defences were:‚ÄîFirst, a portal
    3 feet deep, and in it a square portcullis groove; then a rebate for
    a door opening inwards; and, finally, an arched passage 3 feet higher
    than the portal and 6 feet deep. The entrance appears to have been a
    foot-gate only, so that carriages could not enter the inner ward.</p>

  <p>What are called Lancaster‚Äôs buildings occupy most of the inner ward.
    They commence at the forebuilding, and extend along the rest of the
    north side, the whole of the west, and much of the south side. They
    evidently replaced similar buildings of the Norman period, and were
    built towards the end of the fourteenth century. Next west of the
    forebuilding are the remains of the kitchen and buttery, now a mass
    of ruin, much of which is covered up with earth. An immense fireplace
    has been inserted into the wall of the forebuilding, having two very
    perfect ovens lined with thin bricks; another fireplace is formed in
    the adjoining curtain; the fire-backs are also of thin brick, set
    herring-bone fashion. Further on, a curious triangular buttress outside
    the curtain contains a garderobe shaft, the drain from which is a
    squared-headed opening in the rock below, about 6 feet high and 4 feet
    broad. There is a second drain, which traversed the kitchen, and the
    mouth of which, fitted with a groove for a sluice, is seen in the inner
    ward, near the hall door. Probably if the rubbish was removed, the plan
    of these buildings would be visible. Beyond them, the north-western
    angle of the ward is capped by the strong tower, quadrangular, 50
    feet by 40 feet, with octagonal turrets at the two western angles,
    and between them a rather remarkable triangular buttress. The tower
    is of three stages, all vaulted and groined, each vault of four bays
    springing from a central pier. It is of the date of the hall and
    kitchens, from the foundations. This tower probably derived its name
    of the ‚ÄúStrong Tower‚Äù from its use as a prison, though evidently for
    persons of consequence. The windows are plain, flat-topped openings. In
    the sides of one of the splayed recesses, looking towards the west, are
    some coats-of-arms scratched in the stone. Those that have been made
    out are four.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

  <p>1. Six cross-croslets flory, on a bend three pheons bend-wise, points
    depressed to the sinister.</p>

  <p>2. Quarterly, per fesse embattled.</p>

  <p>3. On a quarter a fret (or fretty).</p>

  <p>4. Quarterly, 1 and 4, a cross botonn√©.</p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;‚Äû &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 and 3, three crescents inverted.</p>

  <p>Next to this tower is the <em>Hall</em>, which occupies nearly the whole
    west side of the ward. This, for dimensions, proportion, material, and
    workmanship was probably the finest hall in the kingdom, wholly of the
    early Perpendicular period. It measured 90 feet by 45 feet, and stood
    upon a basement of the same size, of which the roof was vaulted in
    eighteen square bays, springing from ten piers, arranged with the walls
    in three equal aisles, while against the wall are fourteen responds,
    besides one at each of the four angles. Between each pair is an arched
    recess. This vast and beautiful cellar was aired by loops upon the east
    side only. The cross aisle at the north end was partitioned off by a
    stone screen as a passage, which traversed the cellar, having at its
    east end a door from the inner ward, and to the west a postern opening
    on the outer ward. This postern is a square-headed doorway, with a
    bold portcullis groove, and immediately above it is a small square
    window traversed by the grate, and in the cill of the hall window
    above is a round hole for the chain, by which the grate was lifted.
    This portcullis is rather a tribute to the military character of the
    building, than for the affording any special security, for the large
    windows of the hall above would have admitted an army. The cellar was
    entered by a side door from the passage, and at its south-west corner
    was a small apartment, a cellaret, whence a small well-stair led to the
    ‚Äúbuffet‚Äù above. The hall, resting upon its vaulted floor, is one storey
    above the inner ward level. It was approached by a broad, straight
    staircase, which landed in a porch at the north end of the east side
    of the room. The porch rested upon a vault, and was itself vaulted and
    groined and richly panelled. The hall was lighted by four large windows
    towards the west or outer ward, and by three towards the inner ward. At
    the upper two-thirds of the room, opposite each other, and between two
    pair of windows, are two large fireplaces. They have lintels slightly
    shouldered, no hoods or projection, and their splays are panelled.</p>

  <p>At the upper or south end of the hall, on the east side, is a large
    half-octagon oriel, opening by an arch of 15 feet from the dais,
    panelled and groined, and containing three large windows of two lights
    with transoms and foliated heads, and a small fireplace. Opposite to
    this, in the west wall, is a recess of 10 feet opening, the roof of
    which is ceiled, and which is intended for a ‚Äúbuffet‚Äù or sideboard. It
    is flanked by two small octagonal turrets, one of which contains the
    stair which descends to the cellar and rises to the roof. From hence a
    passage led to the withdrawing-rooms at the south end of the hall. The
    buffet projection, with its turrets, matches the strong tower which
    caps the further end of this front.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> The north wall of the hall is
    gone, but there remains the jamb of a large door, probably opening into
    the buttery. In the north-west angle, in the window jamb, a small door
    opens into a well-stair, leading up to the roof. The south wall behind
    the dais is also gone, but one window of the music gallery remains. The
    windows are broad and lofty, set in deep, splayed recesses, panelled
    and fitted with seats. The arches, though four-centred, are rather
    highly pointed. The edge of each recess is replaced by a bold roll. The
    windows are coupled, each of two lights, divided by two transoms, and
    the heads of the openings thus formed are richly foliated. The roof was
    open, of timber, supported by five pair of principals, besides those
    against the wall at each end, and the spandrels of the window arches in
    the main wall are panelled. The exterior buttresses are set on square,
    but have diagonal faces. The door is set in a low drop arch. The whole
    building is Perpendicular of the purest kind, and early in the style.</p>

  <p>From the upper end of the hall a suite of rooms stood along the south
    side of the court, of which only the ruins remain. Beyond the hall was
    the White Hall, now entirely gone; and beyond it a fine oriel window,
    looking into the court, is said to have belonged to the presence
    chamber. Behind this, upon the curtain, is a low turret of bold
    projection, 30 feet by 20 feet, divided by a cross partition into two
    public garderobes, with large cesspits below, a very curious appendage
    to a suite of state rooms. The base of the curtain on this front shows
    traces of Norman work, and seems original. Owing to the superior height
    of the inner ward, the lower 8 or 10 feet of the curtain on this side
    is a revetment.</p>

  <p>Lancaster‚Äôs buildings end in the remains of an octagonal tower, on the
    curtain, and are succeeded by what are called Leicester‚Äôs buildings,
    though it is a shame to use that title at Kenilworth with reference
    to any other than the great earl to whom England owes so much. These
    form the south-east angle of the ward. They cover a plot of 50 feet
    by 90 feet, and are 80 or 90 feet high. They possess no architectural
    merit, and though built of sound ashlar, the walls are thin for their
    height, and they are cracked and much ruined. All the floors and roofs
    are gone. No doubt these buildings replace a Norman tower of some sort,
    but they probably project much further than that did into the outer
    ward. Beyond these, along the eastern face of the ward, Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>‚Äôs
    lodgings and Dudley‚Äôs Lobby extended nearly to the entrance; these are
    now removed, and with them the Norman curtain upon which they rested.</p>

  <p>This inner ward was in itself a very tolerable fortress, the keep
    commanding the whole, and being, from its excessive passive strength
    and rocky base, practically impregnable. The curtains seem to have had
    buildings placed against them nearly all round; they were certainly
    lofty, and from this circumstance and the vantage of the ground on
    which they stood the inner ward overlooked all the exterior defences
    of the place. The ground falls rapidly upon the north, south, and west
    fronts. Along the east front, where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> natural slope was gradual,
    was excavated a broad and deep ditch, which completed the defences of
    the ward. Moreover, it is not improbable that this ditch was continued
    along the north front, occupying the site of the garden, and dying out
    in the low ground near the Swan Tower.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em> has next to be described. This is roughly an oval
    in plan, 270 yards east and west, by 174 yards north and south. The
    inner ward covers about one-sixth of its area, and is placed about 54
    yards and 30 yards from its west and south boundaries, and 67 yards and
    130 yards from those on the north and east, giving a large space in
    the latter direction, which seems to have contained various domestic
    buildings, the entrances, and the chapel. This ward was divided by the
    cross ditch already mentioned, and which extended from the exterior
    northern ditch 150 yards, nearly to the lake. Traces of it remain at
    either end, but most of it has been completely filled up, probably by
    Dudley after Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs visit. It was 70 feet broad, and across
    it a bridge led up to the entrance of the inner ward. At the north end
    this ditch must have been very deep; towards the south, in front of
    Leicester‚Äôs buildings, where part of it remains, the ground falls and
    it becomes shallow. Probably as an additional protection, a cross wall
    was built in the rear of this ditch from the south-east corner of the
    inner ward to the opposite curtain. Part of this wall was removed when
    Leicester‚Äôs buildings were constructed, but the outer end remains, and
    a part of a doorway in it. This ward is crossed by another wall of
    later date, which extends from the Strong Tower to the west curtain,
    about 34 yards. In its centre is a doorway of 10 feet opening, which,
    with the wall, seems of Perpendicular date. Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlaisance‚Äù
    was built on each side of this gate to the north. The first wall is no
    doubt original, and was intended to prevent an enemy who had crossed
    the ditch where it was shallow pushing westwards along the outer ward;
    the second was probably built to shut off the garden on the north
    front, in the Lancastrian period. In this outer ward is what appears to
    be a part of the original earthworks of the early residence. In front
    of the hall, about on a level with its floor, so that the cellar wall
    is a revetment, is a triangular platform about 72 feet long at its
    base along the wall, and of about 63 feet projection at its apex. It
    is about 30 feet above the rest of the ward, and has a slope of one to
    one. The cutting for the path from the hall postern divides it from a
    smaller mound to the north, and the whole seems artificial, or nearly
    so. This platform commands the outer curtain. It is odd it was not
    included within the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The broad space to the north, called in Dudley‚Äôs time the garden, and
    now a large kitchen garden, has probably been partially raised by the
    ruins of the keep and of the north curtain. How it was originally
    occupied is not known; possibly there was a ditch here. If the
    Lancastrian lords made the passage through the forebuilding and the
    alcove in the curtain, they must have laid out the space <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>within
    the ditch as a garden. Of the many detached buildings that at various
    times must have stood in the outer ward, and especially in the eastern
    section of it, the site of but one, the chapel, is known. This was an
    oblong nave, without aisles, having an east end of three sides of a
    hexagon, and across which is the foundation of a wall. The interior
    breadth was 33 feet; the length has not yet been excavated. Probably
    there was always a chapel here, for a capital has been found in it of
    Norman work much earlier than the keep, but the building, of which the
    foundations remain, is of Decorated or early Perpendicular date, as is
    evident from the plan, and from parts of the sedilia which have been
    dug up.</p>

  <p>The <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of this outer ward, about 750 yards in length, and
    including rather above nine acres, is mainly composed of a curtain
    wall, upon which are six rather important buildings. These are
    Mortimer‚Äôs and Swan Towers, Leicester‚Äôs Gatehouse, Lunn‚Äôs Tower, the
    Stables, and the Water Tower. Mortimer‚Äôs Tower derives its name either
    from Lord Mortimer of Wigmore, who led in a tournament here in the
    reign of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, or from a Sir John Mortimer imprisoned here by
    Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> It is a gatehouse, and stands upon the inner end of the dam,
    and occupies a salient of the curtain to the south-east. It is in plan
    60 feet deep, by 55 feet broad; in the rear, flush with the curtain
    and projecting from it, 54 feet. The entrance passage is in the centre
    of its length, and the outer portal opened between two half-round
    towers of 18 and 20 feet diameter. Within the arch was a portcullis
    in a square groove of dimensions for a wooden grate, and behind this
    a rebate for folding doors. The passage then widens a little with a
    curved splay, and on each side a door 2 feet wide opens into a lodge
    looped to the front and to the outside. In the rear of the east lodge
    is a solid wall 7 feet thick; but to the west lodge has been added a
    garderobe, and beyond it is the shaft of a second garderobe from the
    upper floor, and below them a sewer which opened into the lake. The
    loops are all cruciform. There was a second portcullis, the groove for
    which is stopped up, and at the inner face a rebate for a second pair
    of doors. The upper floor of this gatehouse has been removed. It is
    evident that it has been much altered. Originally it was composed of a
    mere pair of parallel walls, as at Berkhampstead and Coningsborough,
    7 feet thick and 12 feet apart, and these form the back part of the
    present building. Of the upper floor a fragment remains outside the
    west wall, carrying on corbels the overhanging vent of a garderobe.
    To the plain rectangular tower the front drums and lateral chamber
    were added. The mouldings of the original structure are early, and
    of the later, more perfect Decorated; but the work is of an inferior
    character. The whole structure seems to have been originally built and
    added to in haste.</p>

  <p>On its east side, this gatehouse was joined by the ward curtain, here
    6 feet thick, of which a few yards have been removed. On the west,
    the curtain passes back straight and then turns westward at a right
    angle, forming a shoulder, by which means the long southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> face is
    flanked. Near the angle is a postern door descending by steps to the
    lake. In the rear of the gatehouse is a shaft upon a culvert, which
    seems to have brought water from the lake into the lower floor of the
    Water Tower. There may have been a mill thus fed within the outer
    ward. In front, the eastern drum of the gatehouse is connected with a
    long curtain wall, which crested the edge of the dam to the east, and
    abutted upon the gatehouse, closing one of its loops. In this curtain,
    near that end, a small Decorated doorway gave access to the lower lake.</p>

  <p>Passing westwards from Mortimer‚Äôs Tower, the curtain is seen to
    rest upon ground a few feet above the level of the lake and a few
    yards distant from its margin. It is of all dates from Norman to
    Perpendicular, and is from 20 to 30 feet high outside, and inside
    less by 6 or 8 feet. Opposite Leicester‚Äôs buildings, where the wall
    is 5 feet 6 inches thick, are three loops, of 1 foot opening, placed
    in full-centred recesses splayed to 5 feet. They have lighted some
    original Norman building now destroyed. Of the buttresses outside the
    curtain, some are original pilaster strips, others are from 6 feet to
    14 feet broad, and of a projection from 2 feet to 4 feet, with many
    sets-off, and of a character decidedly Decorated. On the south face
    there are altogether fourteen buttresses. At the two south-west angles
    the wall is capped by two broad, flat buttresses, 10 feet broad and
    2 feet projection. They may be late Norman. In the space of 30 yards
    between these is a shoulder-headed window, of 2 feet opening, and a
    late Decorated postern, which corresponds with the postern below the
    great hall. Beyond this a depression in the ground causes the wall
    to be 40 feet high. This western part is about 112 yards long, and
    terminates in the Swan Tower. In it is a large archway of Perpendicular
    date and 18 feet opening, corresponding to the ‚ÄúPlaisance‚Äù of Henry
    <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, and perhaps intended for the purpose of allowing a boat to be
    thence launched upon the lake.</p>

  <p>The Swan Tower caps the north-western angle of the ward. It is an
    octagon, but rests upon a base 12 feet high and 40 feet square. The
    upper part has been removed. The base is solid and the inner floor
    about 10 feet above the ground outside. The door to the remaining floor
    is in the gorge. The base of this tower may be either Perpendicular
    or Decorated. It is said to have been remodelled by Dudley. From the
    Swan Tower the north wall ran nearly straight 150 yards to Leicester‚Äôs
    Gatehouse, and upon it were two towers, one rectangular and one
    polygonal. These are gone, as is the wall, excepting one very thick
    fragment, which seems to have closed the cross ditch at its north end,
    and probably is provided with a sluice. A little probing and clearing
    here might bring this into evidence, and settle the breadth of the
    cross ditch. In front of this wall is the great northern outer ditch of
    the castle by which this front is protected from Clinton Green.</p>

  <p>Leicester‚Äôs Gatehouse, built about 1570, is a rectangular building
    56 feet by 28 feet, with bold octagon turrets at the angles, which
    rise slightly above the roof. The basement contained the entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
    passage and gateway, and above it are two storeys. The windows are
    square-headed, of two lights and a transom; and, on the whole, the
    building is a fair example of its period. The passage has been closed
    and converted into two rooms, entered by a curious lateral porch, of
    Italian design, which has been added on. Outside are carved the arms of
    Beauchamp, and the ragged staff is employed as though it was a Dudley
    cognisance. The panelling of the interiors and a fireplace are curious,
    and were brought from the castle. A few yards east of this gatehouse
    are the remains of a buttressed causeway crossing the ditch, here
    nearly filled up. This looks old, and is probably part of the original
    entrance. Beyond this, the ditch deepens and reaches Lunn‚Äôs Tower,
    which caps the east angle of the ward.</p>

  <p>Lunn‚Äôs Tower is cylindrical, 36 feet diameter, and about 40 feet high,
    and stands three-quarters outside the curtain. On the outer face are
    four pilaster strips, 5 feet broad by 6 inches projection, which
    probably rose to the base of the parapet, now gone. They rest on a
    plinth, and the tower has two sets-off, of which they partake. Appended
    to the rear of the tower has been added a sort of half-octagonal turret
    carrying a well-stair‚Äîan early addition. The basement is at the ward
    level, and there are two upper floors containing fireplaces under
    segmental heads. The floors were of timber. The only openings are
    loops: those of the two lower floors are square-headed, placed outside
    in square-headed recesses, ending below in broad fantails like those of
    the keep. Within, they are placed in splayed recesses with segmental
    arches. The basement has a door from the ward, but the upper floors
    are reached by the well-stair, which also opens on the contiguous
    curtain. This curtain on either side for some yards has been removed;
    but fragments remain, and show that a small, round-headed arch sprung
    on each side from the tower to the curtain and supported a garderobe
    at the rampart level over the hollow angle. Close in the rear of this
    tower is a well, lined with ashlar, 4 feet diameter. The curtain south
    of Lunn‚Äôs Tower has been breached for about 50 feet, and beyond this
    it is old and supports a range of stabling and farm buildings 170 feet
    long by 25 feet broad with square buttresses, in the centre of which
    is a large porch with diagonal buttresses and a wide entrance as for
    a barn, with a round-headed arch. The lower stage is of stone, and
    above is a stage of brick and timber. It is said to have been built
    by Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, in the reign of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>; but much of
    it is certainly of far later date‚Äîin the late Perpendicular style.
    The curtain against which it is built is early English or Decorated,
    and the superstructure of the barn seems to be an addition, placed
    there when it was decided to have an upper storey. The arches are
    round-headed and look Decorated, but there are two late Tudor windows.
    The chapel was a few yards from this building.</p>

  <p>Close south of the barn is the Water Tower, a very curious and complete
    building, early in the Decorated style. It is a mural tower, with no
    internal projection, having a base 50 feet broad by 30 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> deep, from
    which it rises as half an octagon, the angles being taken off by two
    diagonal buttresses, between which, in a projection, is a loop which
    lights a garderobe. It has a basement and upper floor, and the culvert
    from the lake discharged under it and washed out its garderobe sewer.
    In the ground floor is a large fireplace, above which is a handsome
    chimney-shaft. This seems to have been a kitchen. There is also a mural
    garderobe. A well-stair, having a spire over its head, leads to the
    upper storey, the floor of which was of timber, and to the battlements
    of the tower and of the curtain. The upper floor has a small room
    appended on the west, with a loop towards the field. The windows are
    of two lights, trefoil-headed. The roof sloped with a moderate pitch.
    It was contained within the battlements. Beyond this is a warder‚Äôs
    chamber, chiefly in the wall, but with a slight exterior projection. It
    contains a large fireplace and a garderobe, and seems of early English
    or early Decorated date. From hence the curtain was 6 feet thick, and
    what remains is supported by three Decorated buttresses. Beyond these,
    a breach of 30 yards extends to Mortimer‚Äôs Tower.</p>

  <p>The walls of this ward, though much repaired and restored, seem to
    occupy the original Norman lines, and are probably in many places of
    the date of the keep. The defences outside the wall are formidable. On
    the north is the ditch cut in the rock, of great depth and breadth, a
    very necessary defence, for beyond it the ground is at least as high as
    the base of the keep. This is Clinton End or Clinton Green, upon which
    are some banks of earth, traces it may be of the great siege by Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, who probably encamped on this side. It is curious that no attempt
    should have been made to fill up the ditch, without which no engine
    could have been brought to play with effect upon the keep. Probably the
    strength of the garrison and the frequent sallies they are known to
    have made prevented this, or faggots may have been used. From Lunn‚Äôs
    Tower to the Water Tower, the ditch is still filled with water, and
    from thence to Mortimer‚Äôs Tower no ditch was needed, the ground being
    low and wet and at times under water. Then follows the dam, above which
    the lake covered the south front, as an arm of it did the west front,
    as far as the Swan Tower. The north was the weak side, the ground there
    being high; but opposed to this was the keep and the very formidable
    ditch. It is said that this ditch could be filled from the lake, and
    the castle thus encircled with water. If so, there must have been a
    small dam, probably at the bridge in front of the old entrance west of
    Lunn‚Äôs Tower.</p>

  <p>The defences on the south require special notice. From Mortimer‚Äôs Tower
    a bank of earth is thrown straight across the valley. It is 80 yards
    long, 15 yards broad, and about 20 feet high on the upper or western
    side. The lower side is strengthened by a ramp in the slope. About a
    third of the way across, a deep and broad cut, now bridged, lets off
    the water and has drained the lake; but whether this was the position
    of the sluice is doubtful. Mortimer‚Äôs Tower closed the inner end of
    this dam, and a curtain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>wall 4 feet thick defended its eastern face.
    At its further end are the remains of the floodgate or gallery tower,
    an outer gatehouse, beyond which is a deep ditch across the dam, which
    was evidently intended to take the overflow of the lake, and perhaps
    to drain it if necessary. It was crossed by a drawbridge, the piers of
    which still remain. This gatehouse is attributed to Lord Leicester,
    who probably recast it. In substance it is certainly much older. A
    grand block of stone, worked with Decorated mouldings, has been used in
    its repairs, and is probably part of the older building, though also
    thought to have been brought from the chapel. A flight of steps from
    this gatehouse descended to the lake, and is superseded by a modern
    farm road.</p>

  <p>It was by this gateway, between the Brayz and the tilt-yard, that Queen
    Elizabeth made her celebrated entry. Dugdale‚Äôs drawing of 1620 seems to
    show a wall on the upper side of the dam, but of this there is now no
    visible trace. The broad and level surface of the dam was well suited
    for a tilt-yard and seems always to have been so employed, as was also,
    no doubt, the Brayz. Such exercises, being attended by numbers of armed
    men, were usually held at the barriers, or outside the main gate of
    the castle, as a precaution against a surprise. The effect of the dam
    was to form a sheet of water 90 yards to 100 yards across, half a mile
    long, 10 feet to 12 feet deep, and covering about 111 acres. Below the
    dam, where the valley is rather broader and the ground naturally low
    and marshy, a second, lower and smaller lake has been formed, the dam
    of which, of a slight character, may be seen along the upper side of
    the road from the station to the castle. This lower lake must always
    have been shallow, but it served to protect the great dam, to cover the
    south-east angle of the castle, and to guard the rear and eastern flank
    of the great outwork. At Ledes there was a ‚Äú<span lang="la">Stagnum Regis</span>‚Äù below the
    dam of the lake, and at Caerphilly the waste water from the lake was
    made to cover the principal front of the castle.</p>

  <p>There remains, finally, to be noticed the great outwork which completed
    the defence of the castle on the south side, and formed a noble
    <i lang="fr">t√™te-de-pont</i> beyond the lake. It bore the name of the Brayz,
    possibly from ‚ÄúBrayda,‚Äù a suburban field or broad place.</p>

  <p>South of the lake, a tongue of high land intervenes between it and a
    more or less parallel brook, which descends from Wedgnock Park, by a
    valley which falls into the Inchford a little below the castle. It
    was the point of this tongue, lying between the two valleys, that was
    taken advantage of for an advanced defence. The ground was scarped
    into a sort of large, flattened half moon, with a front of 300 yards,
    and covering about eight acres. Along its front is a bank about 20
    feet high, and as broad at the top, and upon this are four mounds such
    as in later times were called ‚Äúcavaliers,‚Äù and of which that at the
    south-west end was 40 feet diameter at the top. In front of this bank
    was excavated a ditch, in some parts 40 feet deep and 100 feet broad,
    and in parts double, and in the rear, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> the work rested on the
    lake it was steeply scarped and guarded by a ditch about 20 feet deep,
    beyond which, on the edge of the lower lake, was a bank 10 to 12 feet
    high, so as to make it very difficult to turn the flank of the outwork
    and to enter it from the rear. Near the middle of this outwork was the
    entrance to the castle from the south. Its position is marked by two
    bold drum bastions in ashlar, 25 feet diameter, and 40 feet apart. They
    rise out of the ditch from a plain plinth to the height of 14 feet, and
    so high are solid. Their superstructure is gone. There was, no doubt,
    a drawbridge here, and the road may be traced across the outwork to
    the Floodgate Tower. Here stood the southern of the four gatehouses
    mentioned at Elizabeth‚Äôs visit, and by this she made her entrance. A
    little west of the Brayz is a quarry, which probably supplied some of
    the materials for the castle.</p>

  <p>In advance of the Brayz, between it and the Wedgnock brook, are traces
    of a light bank and ditch, or perhaps two ditches, with flanking
    bastions of earth, intended to check the advance of an enemy from
    that side. The lines cross the road, and are protected by the brook,
    which flows below and in their front. This road‚Äîthe main approach from
    Warwick and the south‚Äîleads direct up to the Brayz entrance, whence
    it makes a sharp turn to the right and skirts the counterscarp of the
    ditch, so as to be completely commanded from the ramparts.</p>

  <p>It would add much to the appearance of the castle, and bring some of
    its most remarkable features prominently into view, if the owner would
    make an entrance for visitors at the Brayz gate, and allow them to
    approach the castle along the dam through Mortimer‚Äôs Tower.</p>

  <p>The history of the construction of Kenilworth is written with tolerable
    clearness in its earthworks and walls. The English founder probably
    placed his residence upon what became the inner ward; he there fenced
    himself in, as was the manner of his nation, with banks and ditches,
    and walls either of dry stone or timber, taking the highest ground, and
    quartering his herds and herdsmen lower down, nearer to the meadows
    and the marshes in what is now the outer ward. Whether he found it
    necessary to cut the northern ditch to its full depth is uncertain;
    probably not, for its faces are sharp for so remote a period. Some
    ditch, however, there must have been, as without it the other works
    would be of little use. It may be also that there was then dug an
    inner ditch upon the north and east faces, as these were necessary to
    complete the security of the inner ward, and of one at least of them
    there are traces.</p>

  <p>There is no mention of Kenilworth as a lordship until it was granted
    by Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> to Geoffrey de Clinton, who is the reputed founder of
    Clinton‚Äôs Tower or the keep; but this is more probably the work of his
    son, another Geoffrey, between 1170 and 1180, soon after which the
    estate fell to the Crown. Lunn‚Äôs Tower was probably the work of King
    John, about 1200; and the original curtain of the two wards seems to
    have ranged between the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> dates. If the northern ditch of the outer
    work was not previously dug, it must have been dug, or at any rate
    deepened, at this period; and this applies also to the northern and
    eastern ditches, which seem to have covered the corresponding faces of
    the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The character of the ground makes it probable that the Norman fortress
    had but one entrance. This could not have been on the east, west, or
    south fronts, as the ground was low and marshy; nor on the north,
    where the ditch is wide and deep, and on which side the inner ward had
    no corresponding gateway. The obvious position would be where is now
    Leicester‚Äôs Gatehouse, between the high ground of Clinton Green and the
    marsh land, and the way from which towards the gateway of the inner
    ward would be commanded by the keep.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> spent large sums here, and the Water Tower and adjacent
    Warder‚Äôs Tower and the stair of Lunn‚Äôs Tower are probably his work,
    together with large repairs to the south and east curtain. It is
    also pretty certain that to him must be attributed the great dam,
    and therefore the older parts of Mortimer‚Äôs and the Gallery Towers.
    Of parallel cases, the lake at Caerphilly belongs to the end of that
    reign; as, or to the commencement of that of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, does the
    completion of that at Ledes in Kent. The Brayz, being a necessary
    adjunct to the dam, must have been contemplated while that was made,
    and therefore is probably of the same date. The light earthworks
    crossing the Warwick road are probably the work of Simon de Montfort
    the younger, thrown up in haste to check the approach of the royal
    troops from Warwick. Save the Gallery Tower, bridge, and the outer
    gatehouse, there does not appear to have been any masonry beyond the
    lake.</p>

  <p>The castle contains but little pure Decorated work. The kitchens, hall,
    and rooms to the south-east, called Lancaster‚Äôs buildings, are probably
    the work of John of Gaunt, late in the fourteenth century. They no
    doubt replaced other less magnificent domestic buildings of Norman
    date. The chapel seems rather earlier than the hall, the barn later,
    and its upper floor later still.</p>

  <p>The later Plantagenet and earlier Tudor sovereigns did little more
    than keep up the place; and thus it remained, until it was granted by
    Elizabeth to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who spent a large sum of
    money upon it in buildings and gardens, most of which have disappeared.
    He gutted the keep and forebuilding, and fitted them up in the Tudor
    style; and raised the lofty, but flimsy, pile known as Leicester‚Äôs
    buildings. He also embellished the entrance by the Brayz and Gallery
    Tower, and built the gatehouse still standing to the north-east, a very
    fine example of a declining period in English architecture. He probably
    filled up the east ditch and the inner north ditch, if such there was.
    The castle does not seem to have been inhabited after Leicester‚Äôs
    death. Prince Henry and his brother used it more for its chase than as
    a residence, and their successors, until recently, allowed it to be
    used as a quarry. During the Parliamentary wars, the north side of the
    keep was taken down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> and the gorge of Lunn‚Äôs Tower blown up. Probably
    the lake was drained afterwards, when land became valuable.</p>

  <p>Kenilworth is evidently the worth or dwelling of Kenelm; though who
    Kenelm was, or when he lived, are matters unrecorded. He was certainly
    a considerable person, both because he gave name to his estate and
    because his dwelling-place was evidently extensive and strong. It
    appears from Domesday that Kenilworth was a member of the royal manor
    of Stanlei or Stoneleigh, held as ancient demesne, the tenant doing
    suit and service upon the mote known as Motstow Hill. This mote, one of
    the most interesting English remains in the midland counties, stands,
    as it did at Domesday, and probably for several preceding centuries,
    upon a ridge of rock which forms the left bank of the Sow, opposite
    to the curious old Norman church of Stoneleigh. Some excavations upon
    its flanks have somewhat injured its integrity; but it is still a
    very marked feature in the valley, and one of the very few mote hills
    in the midland counties. A steep hollow way leads up to it from the
    river. The register of Stoneleigh Abbey mentions a castle in the manor,
    which was destroyed by the Danes in the wars between King Edmund and
    Canute, and which stood at a place called Holm Hill, on the Avon, in
    the woods opposite to the site of the late Abbey of Stoneleigh. As the
    destruction probably relates only to the timber superstructure, it is
    not unlikely that the mound or burh remains. Unfortunately, Holm Hill,
    as the ground thereabouts is still called, is in one of the Stoneleigh
    preserves, and therefore, not unreasonably, closed against strangers.
    Kenilworth at Domesday was in two parts: Opton or Upton, containing
    three hides, held direct of the king by Albertus Clericus, in pure
    alms; and Chineworde, held by Ricardus Forestarius. Opton is upper-town
    or high-town, the rising ground to the north of the present church;
    Chineworth is Kenilworth proper. Dugdale mentions a Richard Chineu as
    the same with Ricardus Forestarius, and cites the ‚ÄúTesta de Nevill‚Äù;
    but the name does not appear in the index to the printed volume of that
    record. Chineworth may be an accidental coincidence, or it may be a
    corruption of Kenilworth.</p>

  <p>The two members continued in the Crown until Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> granted them
    to Geoffrey of Clinton, or Glinton, in Oxfordshire, one of his
    chamberlains and his treasurer, and possibly afterwards justiciary
    of England. Dugdale says he built the castle, and one of his grants
    shows that he had an important residence there, though it may be
    doubted whether any of the masonry now standing is his work. The date
    of Henry‚Äôs grant is not known, but no doubt it was before 1122, about
    which year Geoffrey de Clinton founded the priory of Kenilworth, from
    the local endowment of which he reserved his castle and park. Speed
    places the building of the church as early as 1112, but Robert, Bishop
    of Chester, who was consecrated in 1121, is one of the witnesses to
    the foundation charter. The Abbey of Stoneleigh was not established
    at that place till 1154, when Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> translated it from Radmore in
    Staffordshire. To Geoffrey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> de Clinton, who was living as late as 1129,
    succeeded Geoffrey his son, a chamberlain to Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, who acquired
    ten knights‚Äô fees in the county by marriage with Agnes, daughter of
    Roger de Bellomont, Earl of Warwick. These he held, 12 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> He
    was a large benefactor to the monks of Kenilworth, but he alienated
    the castle to the king, who held it, 12 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, for some years. It
    was then recovered by Geoffrey, who, in a charter to the priory, says,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Postquam castellum meum et Honorem meum recuperavi</span>.‚Äù It remained
    in his hands for about seven years, when it was again obtained by
    the king, who held it, 19 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and 27 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, as did his
    successors. The date of Geoffrey‚Äôs death is unknown, but it was after
    1165. The king evidently strengthened the place, for the entries in
    his reign relating to it are frequent and important. In 19 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    it was victualled and garrisoned: the prices and quantities of the
    stores are set down in the Pipe Roll. In 27 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, ward-silver and
    a commutation for castle-guard were paid to the sheriff, and rent,
    probably from persons living there for security. In 30 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, the
    walls were repaired. In it there was then a prison, which was repaired,
    31 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> The castle was kept in order during Richard‚Äôs reign, and
    was much valued by King John, who, early in his reign, took a re-lease
    from Henry, son of the second Geoffrey de Clinton, with whom, or his
    son, another Henry, the name disappeared from Kenilworth.</p>

  <p>King John paid five visits to Kenilworth between 1204 and 1215, and
    by his order large sums of money were spent upon the castle, and much
    wine was sent there. In 13 John, the sheriff is allowed sums of ¬£361
    and ¬£102, and in the following year ¬£224‚Äîall for buildings. In 17 John,
    ¬£402 was thus spent. No doubt, King John may have built the keep in
    those years; it is, however, more probable that it was of earlier date,
    the work of the second Geoffrey; but John may well have built Lunn‚Äôs
    Tower.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> was much at Kenilworth, and the sheriff‚Äôs accounts show
    large and frequent expenditure very early in his reign. In 3 Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, a chapel was built, probably in the outer ward, and ¬£150 allowed
    to rebuild a tower that had fallen. In each year more or less is spent.
    In 5‚Äì7 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the wind was high, and blew down several trees in
    the park, and much damaged certain buildings in the castle. Wine was
    occasionally sent there from Southampton. In 13 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the bank
    of the pool was repaired, and two years later there were more repairs,
    and mention is made of a gaol delivery by the judges. King John had
    already used the castle as a prison. In 19 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, ¬£6 16<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
    was allowed for a fair and beautiful boat to lie near the door of the
    king‚Äôs great chamber. No doubt the king had by that time constructed
    the dam and formed the lake. In 22 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Archbishop Walter de
    Gray had temporary charge of the castle, to receive there Ottoboni, the
    papal legate, who was himself soon afterwards placed in charge of it.
    In 26 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, more money was spent. The chapel was to be ceiled
    with wainscot and painted, and seats provided for the king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> and queen.
    The tower where the bells hung was to be repaired, a new wall built on
    the south side by the pool, and the queen‚Äôs chamber to be painted. No
    doubt the Water Tower and the early part of, and perhaps the additions
    to, Mortimer‚Äôs Tower were of this period, as well as the dam and the
    outworks beyond it. Henry seems to have completed the military works
    pretty much as they are now seen.</p>

  <p>In 28 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Simon de Montfort appears as governor for the king;
    and, in 32 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Alianor, the king‚Äôs daughter, and Earl Simon‚Äôs
    wife, has the custody of the castle for life. In 34 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    such was the state of the district that the constable of the castle
    was ordered to cut away the woods to a breadth of six acres between
    Coventry and Warwick. In 38 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the Earl of Leicester and his
    countess had a grant of the castle for their lives, a concession by
    which Henry made over to his most dangerous enemy the strongest and
    most central fortress in his dominions. The events by which the king
    and the earl became opposed in arms in the field, and the succession
    of great events which led to the death of the earl, and the celebrated
    siege of Kenilworth, belong to the history of England rather than to
    that of Kenilworth, and form one of its most interesting and most
    valuable chapters. The subject has fallen under the pen of Mr. Green,
    and has found a place in the pages of the <cite>Arch√¶ological Journal</cite>
    (vol. xxi. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 277), where the course of the events is disentangled, and
    very clearly narrated, and their political significance and bearing
    upon the constitutional history of our country treated in a manner both
    brilliant and profound. Earl Simon had evidently prepared Kenilworth as
    the base of his operations in the impending struggle; and upon his fall
    and death at Evesham, his son at once completed the preparations, and
    made his arrangements for a protracted defence. It was under the walls
    of Kenilworth that the younger Simon was surprised and nearly captured
    by the superior activity of Prince Edward, and it was from Kenilworth
    that he was marching when intercepted by the superior generalship of
    the prince, on the eve of the battle of Evesham.</p>

  <p>The death of the earl and the defeat of his party brought out into
    strong relief the immense military value of Kenilworth. Thither fled
    all who escaped from the field, and they were employed in scouring
    the country, and adding to the immense stores already accumulated
    there. Richard, Earl of Cornwall, the king‚Äôs brother, was a prisoner
    there, and the conduct of Sir Simon towards him bears testimony to the
    prudence and moderation of the captor. He set free Richard, his son,
    and his followers, and despatched them to the Parliament convoked in
    September at Winchester, in the hope, not altogether in vain, that
    moderate counsels would ultimately prevail.</p>

  <p>The possession of Kenilworth was the first object of the royal party;
    but not only was the castle strong, and its resources abundant, but
    the popular cause was in the ascendant, and the garrison included some
    of the greatest nobles and bravest soldiers in England. Henry, forty
    years before, had learned by the experience of Bedford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> that the siege
    of a well-appointed fortress was no light matter, and his preparations
    were very considerable. On the 8th of December he summoned his nobles
    to a muster at Northampton to proceed against Kenilworth, and on
    26th December he called out the ‚Äúposse‚Äù of Warwick and Oxford, ‚Äú<span lang="la">ad
    gravandum et expugnandum illos qui se tenent in Castro de Kenelworth.</span>‚Äù
    The garrison refused to surrender the castle to Sir Simon, then in the
    hands of their enemies, and pleaded that they held it in trust for the
    Countess of Leicester, and could give it over to none other. It was the
    23rd June, 1265, before the siege was commenced in good earnest.</p>

  <p>The royal head-quarters seem to have been on the north side of the
    castle, probably along the high ground between what is still called
    Camp Field and Clinton Green, and it is not improbable that the king‚Äôs
    pavilion was pitched at the former point so as to be out of reach of
    the sallies of the garrison. On the Sunday after <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret‚Äôs day,
    20th July, the sword of state, called ‚ÄúCurtana,‚Äù was brought to the
    camp, and, in the presence of the king, delivered to the keeper of
    the king‚Äôs pavilion. To the camp came also the legate, Ottoboni; and
    so intent was the king upon the siege that the Duke of Brunswick, who
    had come to Windsor to marry Henry‚Äôs niece, came on to the camp, where
    the marriage ceremony was performed. The garrison was, however, in
    no way daunted by these symptoms of the king‚Äôs determination to take
    the place. They constructed powerful engines, and threw great stones
    from the walls, some of which are probably the stone balls, 18 inches
    diameter, which have been found there, and are still preserved at the
    castle. Unfortunately, the political events were so important that the
    operations of the siege have escaped record.</p>

  <p>As, however, the royal cause gained ground, it became evident that,
    however strong the castle might be, its fall was a question of time
    only, and the counsels of Prince Edward and Prince Richard and the
    legate were directed to hasten this event by moderate means. A royal
    council was summoned, and met at Coventry, to settle the terms to be
    offered to the ‚Äúdisinherited‚Äù; and on the calends of November (31st
    October) the celebrated ‚ÄúDictum‚Äù or ‚ÄúBan‚Äù was proclaimed in camp, and
    on the following day confirmed, and, finally, on the Sunday, read out
    from the pulpit of Warwick Church by the legate in the presence of the
    king. The terms were, however, rejected by the garrison; on which the
    king decided to attack the place by storm, and, 20th November, masons,
    labourers, pioneers, and sappers were ordered up from Northampton.</p>

  <p>Probably the garrison had been improvident; for stores began to fall
    short, the water became bad, and disease broke out. Upon this, the
    garrison asked for time to seek and advise with Simon de Montfort, then
    supposed to be on the continent. This was granted, but as the sickness
    became pestilential, Hastings agreed to surrender on terms. Four days
    were allowed for the retreat of the garrison, with their horses, arms,
    and harness. The necessary safe-conducts bear date the 13th December,
    but the castle was surrendered on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> 12th. The siege had lasted six
    months, at a prodigious expense to the royal exchequer, as Henry soon
    afterwards informed the sheriffs, and to the severe injury of the monks
    of Kenilworth and Stoneleigh, and of the people of the whole midland
    district, who had been harried by both besiegers and besieged. Henry
    left immediately afterwards for Oxford, placing Philip Marmion in
    charge as constable; but before leaving he, by grant dated Warwick,
    16th December, made over the castle and lordship to his brother Edmund,
    Earl of Lancaster.</p>

  <p>Edmund was created Earl of Leicester by his nephew, Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, in 1274;
    and four years afterwards, 7 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, he held a grand tournament
    at the castle, at which Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, specially
    distinguished himself. Edmund‚Äôs son and successor, Earl Thomas,
    enlarged the park, 30 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> On his execution and attainder, the
    castle escheated to Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, who was afterwards brought here a
    prisoner by Henry, Earl Thomas‚Äôs brother and heir, and here retained
    until he was sent to Berkeley. With the new reign the attainder was
    reversed, and Earl Henry held the castle till his death, 19 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    as did his son Henry, created Duke of Lancaster, 25 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    Ten years later, on his death, 35 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Kenilworth came to
    his second daughter and co-heir, Blanch, who married John of Gaunt,
    Edward‚Äôs fourth son, who became Duke of Lancaster, 36 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>On the death of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, John of Gaunt, distrusting the new king,
    his nephew, took up his abode for a time at Kenilworth, and probably
    commenced his alterations there. The works were, no doubt, carried on
    for many years; and certainly were not ended 15 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, 1391‚Äì2,
    when masons, quarrymen, carpenters, and labourers were employed at
    the castle, the result being the remodelling of the inner ward, and
    the construction of the magnificent range of kitchens, hall, and
    state apartments, of which the remains are still visible. When the
    son and successor of John of Gaunt became Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, Kenilworth, with
    the other possessions of the Duchy of Lancaster, fell to the Crown,
    and so remained. The castle received certain small additions, not of
    a military character, and all now removed, from Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> and Henry
    <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> Elizabeth, in the fifth year of her reign, 1563, granted the
    domain to Lord Robert Dudley, creating him in the following year Earl
    of Leicester. Leicester‚Äôs works were considerable. He gutted the keep
    and forebuilding, fitting them up in the Tudor style; built the pile
    of masonry, now nodding to its fall, and which bears his name, at the
    south-east corner of the inner ward; he built or restored the Gallery
    Tower upon the outer end of the dam; probably added an upper storey to
    the great barn; and built the great gatehouse, a very fine specimen of
    its age.</p>

  <p>Probably also, late in his life, he filled up the ditch of the inner
    ward. His masonry, though of ashlar, and not ill executed, was not
    substantial; and upon the removal of the floors and roofs, the
    walls became unsafe, and much has fallen and is about to fall. No
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>doubt his works were executed with great rapidity, since his famous
    reception of Elizabeth here took place in 1575. Leicester‚Äôs conduct
    threw a doubt upon the legitimacy of his only son, of which King James
    availed himself to make an enforced purchase of Kenilworth for an
    inconsiderable sum for Prince Henry; after whom it was held by Prince
    Charles, probably more for the use of the chase than as a residence. At
    that time the lake covered 111 acres, and there were four gatehouses;
    the four being, no doubt, Leicester‚Äôs Gatehouse, Mortimer‚Äôs and the
    Gallery Towers, and the entrance gate of the Brayz.</p>

  <p>Charles granted Kenilworth, in 1621, on a lease on lives to Carey,
    Earl of Monmouth, which was converted into a freehold in 1626, and
    upon which the Careys founded a claim at the restoration in 1660;
    Colonel Hawkesworth and others having held it while Cromwell was in
    power. Finally it was granted by Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> to Lawrence Hyde, Earl of
    Clarendon, from whom it has descended in the female line to its present
    owner, whose conduct shows a true appreciation of the value of the remains.</p>

  <div class="subhead">DESCRIPTION.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE reader who places before him the two sheets, 37 and 41, of the
    Ordnance Survey, may observe, between the ranges of Penbr√® and
    Mynydd-Sulen on the east, and Mynydd-Garreg and Llangyndeyrn on the
    west, a valley of about ten miles in length, and from one and a half
    to three in breadth. The head waters of its stream spring from the
    well-known elevation of Mynydd-mawr, and its mouth opens upon the
    Bristol Channel, between the estuaries of the Llwchwr and the Towy, in
    the bay of Caermarthen.</p>

  <p>This is the valley of the Gwendraeth (white-strath)‚Äî</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">‚ÄúGwendra that with such grace delib‚Äôrately doth glide‚Äù‚Äî</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">one of the larger rivers of Caermarthen. West of this valley, between
    it and the Towy, but of much smaller dimensions than either, is a
    second valley and stream, tributary to the former, and bearing,
    like it, the name of Gwendraeth (‚Äúfach,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe less,‚Äù being its
    distinction). The rivers meet in a sort of estuary, chiefly formed by
    the ‚ÄúGwendraeth-fawr.‚Äù</p>

  <p>These valleys are traversed by the roads leading from the strait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
    and tower of Llwchwr to the castles of Llanstephan and Caermarthen,
    as well as by the northern and originally Roman road from Llwchwr to
    Caermarthen, so that the district lies in the way between England and
    Pembroke and Cardigan, and was, in consequence, known at an early
    period to, and often crossed by, the Norman invaders of South Wales,
    who attached considerable importance to its possession.</p>

  <p>The castle and town of Kidwelly are placed upon either bank of the
    Gwendraeth-fach, on the verge of the hill country, here divided from
    the sea by a marsh of a quarter of a mile in breadth.</p>

  <p>The new town, parts of which are of high antiquity, with its church and
    some remains of a priory, stands upon the left bank, and is traversed
    by the old road from Llwchwr to Caermarthen. A mile east of the town,
    the road crosses the Gwendraeth-fawr by an ancient and narrow bridge.
    Close west of the town a similar bridge crosses the Gwendraeth-fach,
    just below the castle, with which it is connected by a suburb, said by
    Leland to be the original town, and, in his time, enclosed within a
    wall with three gates.</p>

  <p>The castle stands from 80 feet to 100 feet above the river, on the
    right bank, here steep and rocky. It thus protects and overawes the
    town and priory, which are opposite to and below it. The eastern face
    is defended naturally by the steep and the river. On the other sides
    the defences are wholly artificial. The castle weir and a leat lead the
    water from the river, cutting off a bend, to the mill, which is placed
    between the castle and the town bridge.</p>

  <p>Kidwelly is distant from the tower of Llwchwr, eleven miles; from the
    castles of Llanstephan and Caermarthen, five and nine miles; and from
    those of Dryslwyn and Dynevor, thirteen and eighteen miles.</p>

  <p>The Gwendraeth seems to have derived a part of its name from the
    ‚Äútraeth‚Äù or ‚Äústrath‚Äù of meadow land found along its course, the
    fertility of which may have led to the establishment of the town and
    priory of Kidwelly.</p>

  <p>Cydweli is the name of one of the three commots of Eginoc, one of the
    four cantrefs or hundreds of the ancient county of Caermarthen, which
    included Gower. The adjacent commot of Carnwyllion, north of Kidwelly,
    contained the strong pass of the same name, and is often mentioned in
    local records.</p>

  <p>The lordship of Kidwelly extends from the Llwchwr to the Towy, and
    includes the parliamentary borough of Llanelly, and the municipality of
    Kidwelly. The franchise of the corporation is reputed to extend beyond
    the town, around the castle precinct. Of this franchise the mayor is
    the lord, holding his courts in the town. The courts for the lordship
    are held in the castle.</p>

  <p>Kidwelly is a castle of the Edwardian or concentric type, slightly
    modified from the perfect examples of Beaumaris and Caerphilly. It is
    composed of the ‚Äúcastle proper,‚Äù containing the inner and outer ward,
    and the ‚Äúoutworks,‚Äù containing the southern and northern platforms.</p>

      <span class="xsmall">GENERAL PLAN</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

  <p>The castle is in plan nearly a semicircle, the main ditch forming the
    curve, and the cliff and river the chord. The long axis lies north and
    south, and the gateways are at opposite ends. The whole work measures
    440 yards, by from 90 yards to 130 yards, and covers about three acres.</p>

  <p>The <em>Inner Ward</em> contains the drum towers, the curtains, the
    chapel tower, the hall, and the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The drum towers are four:‚ÄîThe north-west or black tower; the
    south-west or Astragun Tower; the south-east or Margaret Dun Tower;
    and the north-east tower. All are of one date, and nearly of one
    pattern,‚Äîcylindrical, 30 feet diameter, with walls 9 feet thick. They
    are 44 feet high, with a battlement, and each has a well-stair at
    the gorge, terminating above in a square turret, the top of which is
    53 feet high. Each contains a <i lang="fr">souterrain</i>, and three stages of
    circular chambers, looped outwards, usually with three openings. There
    are also the usual chambers in the walls, and doors opening upon the
    ramparts of the curtains. There are also some points of difference.
    The chambers of the south-west tower are vaulted; the rest have timber
    floors. In this tower the <i lang="fr">souterrain</i> is entered by a long
    gallery in the wall, common to the south curtain and the kitchen,
    opening from the porter‚Äôs lodge. This is the ‚Äúporter‚Äôs prison,‚Äù and
    possibly the vaulting was to allow the whole tower to be used for
    this purpose. The north-west tower is cylindrical below, but above it
    passes into a sort of heart-shaped plan, presenting towards the gorge
    a double bow, with a flat recess between. These two towers cap the
    angle of their curtains, and are engaged in about one-fifth of their
    circumference.</p>

  <p>The north-east and south-east towers are placed, not at the angles,
    but on the faces of the north and south curtains, close to their east
    ends, and on the edge of the river cliff. Besides their junction with
    the curtains of the inner ward, they are connected north and south with
    that part of the curtain of the outer ward which is built along the
    edge of the cliff. The south-east tower is closely connected with the
    chapel tower, and has also a door opening upon the curtain of the outer
    ward, leading to the great gatehouse.</p>

  <p>The curtains are four in number. That to the east is irregular, low,
    and weak; the cliff has been considered its defence. The other three
    are 6 feet thick, and 18 feet high to the top of the parapet. Along
    each is a rampart walk, having a parapet pierced with loops and a rere
    wall. The curtains enclose a quadrangle 80 yards square.</p>

  <p>The north curtain is pierced by a gateway, 6 feet wide, with a low
    drop arch, and the groove of a portcullis worked from the rampart; it
    is near the east end of the wall, and nearly opposite the northern
    gatehouse. This curtain is pierced by two loops, which seem to have
    been defended from the ground level. The west curtain has three loops,
    two of which opened from the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The south curtain is pierced near its centre by a gateway, 10 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
    wide, with a low drop arch and portcullis groove. The wall has been
    thickened to give depth to the gateway, and possibly to allow of the
    superstruction of a low tower above it. This is the principal entrance
    to the inner, and opens towards the great gatehouse of the outer, ward.</p>

  <p>The chapel tower, forming part of the east curtain, deserves particular
    attention. It is an oblong building, springing from a rectangular base;
    but, as the two outer or eastern angles are formed by buttresses, each
    of which is a half pyramid, cut diagonally, the plan of the upper part
    is an oblong, with the two eastern angles removed so as to form an
    apse. As this tower projects some way down the steep, its outer face is
    56 feet high and its inner only 20 feet. Its top is 24 feet lower than
    that of the contiguous south-east tower.</p>

  <p>Against the south side of the chapel tower is a small square projection
    containing a vestry. This does not rise to the clerestory.</p>

  <p>The chapel tower has three floors, all ceiled with timber. The interior
    is 26 feet from the altar to the west end, and 18 feet broad. The
    east wall is 6 feet thick; the west wall, 3 feet. In the south-east
    corner is a mural gallery, leading to a sewer chamber below the vestry.
    In the north-east corner is a well-stair. The ground floor is below
    the level of the inner ward, and is entered by a curved stair from
    the adjacent hall. The next, or first floor, is on the level of, and
    entered directly from, the hall. Above this, and on the rampart level,
    is the chapel. This includes two tiers of windows, the upper being a
    clerestory, and is entered by a west door. The east window is common to
    both tiers. It is a long, narrow, and acutely-trefoiled loop, set in a
    broad recess, which nearly occupies the whole east bay of the apse, and
    has a flat drop arch with a plain rib.</p>

  <p>In the face next south of the altar-place is a small trefoiled piscina,
    and next to this a broad recess or sedile under a drop arch. On the
    south side, a small, acutely-pointed door leads to the vestry, and west
    of this is another recess, with a flat drop arch, and in it, close
    to its east side, a loop, long since blocked up, intended to defend
    the nook between the vestry and the south-east tower, and to rake the
    adjacent curtain. There is also a trefoiled loop in the north wall, and
    a door long closed up.</p>

  <p>The clerestory is lighted by nine windows, three on each side,
    and three, including that to the east, in the apse. They are all
    alike‚Äîlong, narrow, acutely-trefoiled openings, within broad recesses,
    plainly ribbed, and with flat drop arches. All rest inside upon a
    string, a filleted half round, which dips to pass under the east
    window. Between each pair of windows is a plain corbel block for
    the roof timbers. There is nothing, save the battlements, above the
    chapel. The walls have been stuccoed. The west wall has neither ashlar
    dressings nor string course, and is of different date and inferior work
    to the rest of the tower.</p>

  <p>The hall, 60 feet by 25 feet, filled up, with the retiring-room, the
    whole east side of the inner ward. Its south end is formed by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>the
    south-east tower, the circular face of which has been patched and
    plastered to present a flat surface towards the hall, and this addition
    still shows the height and pitch of the hall roof. The west wall of the
    chapel forms part of the east wall of the hall; and in another part of
    this, which was also the outer wall towards the river, are traces of
    a window recess, like those of the chapel. Near this, also connected
    with the chapel, is a projecting space from the curtain, which may have
    been a sort of oriel or small chamber attached to the hall. In the west
    wall, at the south end, is an ashlar door or window jamb. The west wall
    is destroyed.</p>

      <span class="xsmall">INTERIOR Of CHAPEL.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The retiring-room is of the breadth of the hall, and 30 feet long. It
    communicates with the north-east tower. Its west wall is tolerably
    perfect. It has been stuccoed, and includes a doorway. The cross wall,
    and perhaps the place of its door opening into the hall, may be traced.
    A trefoiled and recessed loop, of the date of those in the chapel,
    remains on the east side in the curtain; and close south of it is the
    fireplace, with a carved base to the chimney shaft. The whole of the
    east curtain seems to have been employed to carry the roofs of the hall
    and retiring-room, and was probably defended by a battlement accessible
    from the roof gutter. The commanding position of the north-east and
    chapel towers and the steep rise from the river would render this the
    least accessible side of the castle.</p>

  <p>The kitchen is placed opposite to the hall, in the south-west corner
    of the court. It is 30 feet by 17 feet, and appears from its remaining
    gable to have had a highly-pitched roof. At each end, north and south,
    is a large fireplace, with magnificent tunnels. On the west side, which
    is formed by the curtain, a window of narrow opening but broad recess
    opens into the outer ward. Towards the south end is a third fireplace,
    of smaller dimensions, apparently intended for stewing and similar
    operations, like a modern hot closet.</p>

  <p>In the east wall is a narrow doorway, placed within and on one side of
    a wider arch, which at breast high is opened to its full breadth. This
    seems to have been devised to allow servants to carry out large dishes
    without opening a doorway of unnecessary breadth. On each side of this
    door are low, broad openings, evidently intended for buttery hatches.</p>

  <p>The north-west angle of this ward is occupied by an enclosure 45 feet
    square, of which the two curtains form two sides. It is walled in, and
    may have contained offices or barracks.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em> is nearly semicircular, the inner ward being
    built upon the middle of its chord. Its parts are the great and lesser
    gatehouses, the curtains, the mural towers, and the offices. The inner
    ward has no ditch, and the space between the walls of the two wards is
    on the north side, 90 feet; on the west side, 60 feet; and on the south
    side, 80 feet.</p>

  <p>The great gatehouse is a fine pile of building. It is an oblong mass,
    80 feet broad by 50 feet deep, and 62 feet high. The gate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>way is 11
    feet high, and 8 feet broad, and has a high drop arch. It is placed in
    a very flat, segmental, arched recess, 20 feet high. The sill of the
    doorway is 12 feet above the bottom of the ditch, and on either side
    it is flanked by a conical round tower, 24 feet in diameter below, and
    20 feet above. Above the gateway, between and on a level with the top
    of the towers, runs a bold machicolation of three flat arches upon two
    corbels.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse has a circular projection eastward towards the river; and
    at its north-west angle a square turret terminates in a watch-tower,
    which rises 93 feet above the court, and is known as ‚ÄúPigin Tower‚Äù
    [Pigwn, Beacon].</p>

  <p>The portals, both towards the field and towards the court, have plain
    chamfered ribs in ashlar; the portal vault is turned in rubble, with a
    portcullis groove at either end. The gates open inwards, so that the
    gatehouse could be defended on either side. There are also three chases
    in the vault, intended for the passage of gratings. The middle one
    appears to have been long closed up.</p>

  <p>The drawbridge dropped across the moat, here reduced 16 feet, upon a
    pier connected with the barbican.</p>

  <p>Entering by the great gate, on the right and left are dungeons and
    guard chambers, with loops commanding the approach. The doorways are
    small, with arches nearly half round, or very slightly pointed. One
    chamber on the right contains a large domed water-tank below the floor,
    two singular recesses in the wall, and a garderobe. A well-stair at the
    north-west angle leads to the first floor, which is also reached by an
    exterior and state staircase from the court, under which is a porter‚Äôs
    lodge. The subterranean chambers and those on the ground floor are
    vaulted.</p>

  <p>The first or principal floor contains a state-room, 40 feet by 17
    feet, with two large windows opening upon the court, and a fireplace
    between them. The windows appear to have been of two lights, trefoiled,
    and they are placed in large, flat, segmental recesses. The roof has
    been of timber, flat, and rather low. On the same floor are three
    smaller rooms and a portcullis chamber; and on the east side, over
    the tank-room, is a vaulted kitchen, with a large fireplace and oven.
    From the kitchen a small door leads to the east rampart, and along it
    to the south-east drum tower. Two well-staircases lead to the second
    floor, which contains also a large chamber, with windows of two lights,
    and trefoiled, opening upon the court, and a fireplace. Here also are
    several bedrooms, with doorways of carved ashlar. This floor seems
    intended for the accommodation of persons of condition. The well-stair
    at the north-west angle is continued upwards to the watch tower; and
    from near this stair a narrow door leads to the rampart of the curved
    curtain, and so to the mural towers of the outer ward.</p>

  <p>The watch tower is considerably higher than any other part of the
    castle, and commands an extensive view over both sea and land.</p>

  <p>The lesser or northern gatehouse is in great part destroyed, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>appears to have been hastily built. It is on a small scale, and
    composed only of two half-round towers, the back or gorge walls of
    which, and part of the portal, have been destroyed. There appears to
    have been an upper story entered by a staircase in the adjacent western
    curtain. The portal arch is gone, but there are traces of a drawbridge
    which worked between two side walls, looped to rake the ditch. That
    on the east remains. The portal was 10 feet wide, and the bridge
    dropped with a span of about 18 feet upon a pier still remaining,
    and projecting from the counterscarp of the fosse. The bridge walls
    are later than the towers, and these probably than the curtain. This
    gateway is placed at the north extremity of the outer ward, only a few
    yards from the river bank. It appears to be an addition.</p>

  <p>The curtain of the outer ward is in three parts: one, 330 feet long,
    and curved, encloses the ward on the west or landward side, and
    connects the gatehouses with the mural towers. This wall is 6 feet
    thick, and 20 feet high, and is defended by the main fosse. Besides
    openings from the gatehouses, there is a direct access to this rampart
    from the court by a mural staircase built against the wall. The
    rampart walk is protected by a parapet and a rere wall, both of which,
    to give breadth to the walk, are thrown out upon corbels or false
    machicolations.</p>

  <p>The second part of the curtain is straight, or nearly so, and extends
    50 feet in length along the river cliff, from the great gatehouse to
    the south-east drum tower. Its rampart is accessible from each end.
    This wall is 30 feet high and 7 feet thick.</p>

  <p>The third portion of the curtain also runs along the river cliff, and
    extends 90 feet from the north-east drum tower to the north gatehouse,
    near which it makes a salient angle. Between this angle and the gate it
    is 5 feet thick; elsewhere, only 2 feet. Possibly there was a tower at
    the angle.</p>

  <p>The mural towers are three in number, all placed in the western
    curtain. They are half round, 30 feet high, 22 feet in diameter, with
    an external projection of 8 feet, and a slight square projection within
    formed by the gorge wall. They have a ground floor, looped, a first
    floor with a fireplace, and a chamber on the level of the rampart walk
    and forming a part of it. The walls are 5 feet thick. The middle tower
    of the three has fallen into the fosse. The masonry of these towers is
    rude, and they are ill-bonded into the wall.</p>

  <p>The offices in this ward are represented by the walls of a detached
    building, 65 feet by 30 feet, with high gables, placed west of the
    inner ward; another room, 60 feet by 35 feet, built against the river
    curtain, near the northern gatehouse; and some outbuildings, kitchens
    probably, and a bakehouse, built against the curved curtain, close west
    of the same gatehouse. These buildings were probably intended for the
    accommodation of the garrison.</p>

  <p>The main ditch sweeps round the north, west, and south sides of the
    outer ward, opening upon the river cliff at, and rising towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> each
    end. The opening at the south-east end, near the great gatehouse,
    is closed by a <i lang="fr">batardeau</i>, which seems to have been embattled
    towards the river, and to have been approached from the barbican. There
    are some traces of a similar wall at the other end, next the north
    gatehouse. This ditch is high above the river, but is fed by land
    waters, and part of it is still wet. It is about 30 feet broad, and
    of considerable depth. Westward it gives off a branch which divides
    the north and south outworks, and communicates with the ditches of the
    former.</p>

  <p>The barbican appears, from the traces of its foundations, to have been
    a small, circular tower. It occupied a rocky knoll on the counterscarp
    of the main ditch, opposite the great gateway, and on the edge of
    the steep bank of the river. It evidently was intended to cover the
    drawbridge, and to force those who arrived by this entrance to pass
    exposed to the fire of the adjacent western curtain. This work seems to
    have been cut off from the other outworks by a dry ditch, or covered
    way, leading from the river, south-west of the barbican towards the
    main ditch.</p>

  <p>The outworks are divided into north and south platforms by the branch
    of the main ditch already mentioned.</p>

  <p>The south platform is defended on the east by the mill leat. It was
    walled in, and seems to have been about 170 yards long by 130 yards
    broad. Part of the wall remains on the west side and on the north,
    along the edge of the branch ditch. At the south end, the approach
    still lies through the outer gatehouse, part only of which is
    destroyed. The portal, a drop arch with portcullis grooves, remains;
    above it are three windows with flat, segmental arches. From the sill
    of the central window a hole opens upon the outside of the portal,
    probably for the passage of missiles. The building has a ground and
    upper floor. There are no traces of ditch or drawbridge. The work is
    rubble. There does not appear to have been any ashlar. The style is
    Perpendicular‚Äîpossibly of the date of the great gatehouse, probably
    later. Grose gives a drawing of this gatehouse in 1786, in which it
    appears much in its present condition.</p>

  <p>The northern platform covers the north and west quarters of the castle.
    It measures about 130 yards long by 90 yards broad, and is enclosed
    within a wet ditch, a branch of which nearly cuts off its northern
    portion, leaving a narrow neck towards the river, across which lay the
    approach to the south entrance. Within the ditches of this work are
    high banks, and indications of a slight wall, and perhaps of a tower,
    near the entrance passage.</p>

  <p>This castle has sustained less injury than might have been expected.
    It has been dismantled, and the ironwork and timber removed, but none
    of its towers or walls appear to have been blown up. The mural tower
    missing from the outer ward has probably slipped into the ditch from
    some defect in its foundation.</p>

  <p>The castle is easy of access and examination, not being overgrown with
    ivy or brushwood.</p>

  <p>The details of Kidwelly afford some general indications of the age of
    its several portions. There is nothing which can safely be pronounced
    to be Norman work, although no doubt the present was preceded by a
    structure partaking both of this and the early English style.</p>

  <p>The general plan or arrangement of the castle seems, from its style, to
    be of one date‚Äîprobably that of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, or early in the reign of
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> The chapel is of this age. Its west wall, however, appears,
    from the peculiarities of its bond, to be of earlier date than the
    rest, and of the same date with the south-eastern drum tower, say
    1260‚Äì80, which would be the date of all the towers and curtains of the
    inner ward, for all are in the same style.</p>

  <p>The great hall seems a little later than the south-eastern tower, the
    face of which has been flattened to suit its gable.</p>

  <p>The walls and mural towers of the outer ward may be a little later than
    the inner ward. That they are part of the original plan may be inferred
    from the want of strength in the inner gatehouses.</p>

  <p>The great gatehouse is decided, but early, Perpendicular, perhaps of
    the reign of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> or Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, 1388‚Äì1400. Pigin tower is a
    later addition.</p>

  <h3>HISTORY.</h3>

  <p>The name of Kydwelly, or Cydwelhi, is Welsh. Leland, whose
    etymologies are not infallible, derives the name from ‚ÄúCathwelli,‚Äù or
    ‚ÄúCattalectus,‚Äù because Cattas used to make his bed in an oak there.
    Others explain ‚ÄúCyd‚Äù to mean an ‚ÄúAber,‚Äù or junction of waters. The
    Catgueli were a Celtic tribe. The town is no doubt of Welsh origin, and
    of high antiquity.</p>

  <p>This does not apply to the castle, which, in its present form at least,
    is of later date, and the site of which, though naturally strong, was
    not that which a Celtic engineer would have selected.</p>

  <p>The castle is supposed to have been founded by a certain William de
    Londres, one of the Norman knights who, in 1091, assisted Fitzhamon
    in the conquest of Glamorgan, and who is recorded afterwards to have
    pushed his arms into Caermarthen, no doubt when, in 1093, the Normans
    ravaged Gwyr, Kidwelly, and Ystrad Tywy, and then to have won from
    the Welsh the lordships of ‚ÄúKidwelly and Carnwilthion.‚Äù‚Äî[Powel, 32.]
    In Glamorgan, this William is known as the founder of the castle of
    Ogmore, the Norman keep of which, though injured, is still standing. It
    is probable that his works at Kidwelly were of a less solid character,
    else all traces of them could scarcely have disappeared.</p>

  <p>It is possible that the gain of De Londres was confined to the town
    and suburb of Kidwelly, for, in 1100, Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> wrested from Iorwerth
    ap Blethyn his lands, and gave to Howel ap Grono the districts of
    Strath-Tywy, Kidwelly, and Gower. Howel, however, was, in 1102,
    slain by the Normans, who had already taken from him the castle of
    Rydcors.‚Äî[Powel, 124.]</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

  <p>In 1113 Griffith ap Rhys, prince of South Wales, took Caermarthen, and
    retreated upon his stronghold in Strath-Tywy, whence he marched upon
    Gower. William de Londres deserted Kidwelly and fled. The Welsh ravaged
    the lands and burned the castle [Powel, 145], which then could hardly
    have been a regular Norman fortress. After this followed a period
    of tranquillity, and Maurice de Londres had a park at Kidwelly, and
    preserved his venison strictly. On one side of the park, next the sea,
    were large sheep pastures. His wife, wishing to have some of the deer
    destroyed, caused wool to be inserted into the bowels of some of the
    stags, and then showed it in proof that they destroyed the sheep; on
    which Maurice allowed the deer to be attacked with dogs.‚Äî[‚ÄúGiraldus
    Cambrensis,‚Äù i. 168.] On the death of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1135, while Griffith
    ap Rhys was absent in North Wales, Gwenllian his wife led an army into
    Kidwelly. She was defeated and put to death by Maurice de Londres, its
    lord, and by Geoffrey, constable to the bishop. Her eldest son, Morgan,
    was slain, and his brother, Maelgon, was taken.‚Äî[‚ÄúGiraldus Cambrensis,‚Äù
    i. 168.] ‚ÄúThe battle-field,‚Äù says the editor of ‚ÄúGiraldus,‚Äù ‚Äúis still
    called ‚ÄòMaes Gwenlian,‚Äô and a tower in the castle, ‚ÄòTwr Gwenlian.‚Äô‚Äù In
    1145, there were already castles at Llanstephan and Dynevor, and, in
    1150, at Llwchwr.</p>

  <p>From the family of De Londres Kidwelly passed, by an heiress, to that
    of De Cadurcis, or Chaworth, whose heiress married Henry of Lancaster,
    grandson of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Henry, his son, and his grandson, held the
    castle until their line also ended in a daughter, who married John of
    Gaunt and was the mother of Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, since which time the estates of
    the Duchy of Lancaster, including Kidwelly, have remained in the Crown.
    It is now in the hands of the Earl of Cawdor.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="KILPECK_CASTLE">KILPECK CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE parish of Kilpeck, in the county of Hereford, occupies a tract
    of rolling broken ground which intervenes between the Mynde, Orcop,
    and Garway ridge of hills and the river Worm, a stream which receives
    the drainage of a considerable valley, and finally falls into the
    Monnow, near Kentchurch. The railway from Abergavenny towards Hereford
    passes up this valley, which affords an excellent example both of the
    fertility and the picturesque beauty of the old red sandstone country
    of Herefordshire.</p>

  <p>The castle, church, and the site of the long-destroyed priory lie
    near together about the village of Kilpeck, two miles north of the
    ridge, and a short mile south of the church and railway station of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Devereux.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <p>The ground falls rapidly towards the north, and is traversed by deep
    dingles, each with its contained streamlet. The hedgerows and steeper
    banks are covered with wood, and the grassy knolls and ridges subside
    into broad level meadows of unrivalled verdure, amidst which the plough
    is but little known.</p>

  <p>Kilpeck Castle, as now seen, is composed almost entirely of earthworks.
    It consists of a mound and circumscribing ditch, beyond which, on
    the north, is a triangular platform, on the south an enclosure of a
    horseshoe figure, and beyond this again a southern platform much more
    extensive, but also somewhat triangular in outline. On the very edge,
    and to the east of these enclosures, stand the ancient Norman church
    and a farmhouse, parts of which are of some antiquity; on the west,
    about 200 yards distant from the castle, the ground falls rapidly
    towards a deep dingle, across the lower part of which has been thrown
    a strong bank of earth, while remains of other banks are seen higher
    up. By these means it is evident that there was formed a chain of long
    and deep lakes, perhaps at two or even three levels, which must have
    rendered any approach from the west, or Welsh quarter, exceedingly
    difficult and hazardous.</p>

  <p>The mound is wholly artificial. It is conical and truncated, and of
    oval plan. Its summit measures, north and south, about 25 yards, and
    east and west about 40 yards, and its height is from 20 feet to 40
    feet, according to the depth of its ditch, which is greatest on the
    northern side. The slopes are steep, the red earth having little
    disposition to slip.</p>

  <p>The summit was crowned by a shell keep placed about 3 feet within the
    edge of the slope, and therefore about 23 yards north and south, by 38
    yards east and west. It was polygonal in plan, with faces from 14 feet
    to 15 feet long. Of this shell there remain but two fragments, one on
    the north and the other on the west side, about 20 yards apart. These
    show the wall to have been polygonal without, and circular, or nearly
    so, within, also within vertical, but on the outside battering from 7
    feet thick at the base up to 4 feet at 6 feet high, above which it was
    continued at 4 feet. The north fragment is about 40 feet long, with a
    sine of about 2 feet, and about 18 feet high; probably it was, with the
    parapet, about 25 feet. It contains a round-backed fireplace, 3 feet
    broad by 2 feet deep, which gathers in above into a cylindrical shaft
    of 12 inches diameter. On each side is a water-drain, as from sinks,
    passing through the wall. The other, or western fragment, is 30 feet
    long and about 14 feet high. This also has a fireplace, similar to the
    last, but 5 feet wide and 3 feet deep; on the north side of it is a
    water-drain. From the south end of this there remains a fragment of a
    cross wall, 3 feet thick, which belonged to an interior building; it
    is of the age of the outer wall. This outer wall seems to have been
    blown outward a little by a mine sprung from within. The summit of
    the mound is slightly convex, from the accumulation of rubbish, which
    the fireplaces show to be about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> 4 feet deep. It is said that a deep
    well was discovered here, but no trace of it is now seen. These walls
    are the only remains of masonry visible in the whole castle. From
    their general aspect and that of the fireplaces they seem to be Early
    English. It is clear that the shell contained buildings against the
    wall, which, from the water-drains, may have been kitchens.</p>

  <p>The mound is surrounded by a deep ditch, which on the north is
    succeeded by the north platform, on the north-east, east, and south, by
    the horseshoe platform or outer ward, and on the west by a narrow bank,
    from the base of which the natural slope falls rapidly.</p>

  <p>The outer ward is a platform of a horseshoe or lunated shape, varying
    from 90 yards to 180 yards broad, and covering full half the mound. Its
    concave edge forms the counterscarp of the inner ditch. Its convexity
    is bounded by a ditch from 10 feet to 30 feet deep, which on the east
    borders the churchyard, and on the south is succeeded by the south
    platform, the general level of which is 10 feet to 12 feet below the
    summit of the mound. The outer edge of this area has been raised by a
    bank, which along the south side and at the west end rises 10 feet to
    20 feet, having been no doubt thrown up from the exterior ditch. The
    surface is scarred as by the removal of foundations, but not a trace of
    actual masonry is visible, and even where the bank has been cut through
    no stones are seen.</p>

  <p>There remains the south platform. This is nearly at the level of
    the outer ward, though below that of its elevated edge. The area is
    considerable, probably above four acres. It is divided from the outer
    ward by the ditch common to both, and about 30 feet broad. To the west
    and to the east it has a ditch, but to the south a scarp of about 12
    feet, the ground beyond being flat and at a lower level. The present
    entrance to this platform, now under tillage, is by a hollow way to the
    east side near the north end, which may be old.</p>

  <p>The main entrance to the castle, that is, to the outer ward, was by
    a gateway at the south point, marked by a deep hollow way cut in the
    bank, and flanked by earth heaps, which may conceal the foundation of
    small towers. This entrance is approached from the east by a road along
    the ditch below the outer ward and the south platform.</p>

  <p>The way from the outer ward into the keep is not opposite the outer
    entrance, but more to the east; a slender causeway crosses the ditch,
    and a path ascends the mound. Probably this is all modern, and here was
    a sloping bridge, rendering the ascent of the mound less steep. At the
    south-west corner the ditch of the mound runs out at one point on the
    hill side, so that from hence a way may have lain along the ditch as
    far as the mound bridge.</p>

  <p>The inference suggested by the present earthworks is something to the
    following effect:‚ÄîOriginally advantage was taken of a natural knoll, of
    an irregular figure, but about 300 yards north and south by 125 yards
    east and west, which was surrounded by a single ditch, or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> where the
    ground allowed, by a scarp only. It may be that here, as partially at
    Malvern, and in other examples, this long enclosure was subdivided
    by two cross cuts into three parts, of which the central formed the
    citadel. This would probably be the work of the British.</p>

  <p>Then it would seem that a later people, the English, took possession,
    and threw up a mound at one corner of the citadel, isolating it by
    its proper circular ditch, the principal dwelling being on the mound,
    and the horseshoe remainder below containing the base court for the
    dependents, while the north and southern portions would serve for
    protected enclosures for cattle.</p>

  <p>When the Normans took possession they seem to have built a shell keep
    upon the mound, and to have employed the base court below as an outer
    ward, probably surrounding the whole with a stone wall, now removed,
    and replacing the English stockade. This would constitute the castle
    proper, to which the north and south platforms would be appendages, no
    doubt stockaded for cattle.</p>

  <p>The history of Kilpeck commences with Domesday, which records, ‚Äú<span lang="la">H√¶
    vill√¶ vel terr√¶ subscript√¶ sit√¶ sunt in fine Arcenefelde. Will‚Äôus
    filius Normanni tenet Chipcete. Cadiand tenuit tempore Regis Edwardi.</span>‚Äù</p>

  <p>The church is decidedly older than the masonry of the keep, and it may
    therefore be that the early Norman lords contented themselves with a
    residence and defences of timber, and did not build for a century or
    so after their occupation, when the shell keep was constructed. It is
    not probable that this was preceded by any earlier work in masonry, as
    Norman buildings were substantial and durable.</p>

  <p>The church has been the subject of a ‚Äúmonograph.‚Äù The priory, of which
    not a trace remains, stood in a field south-east of the castle and
    village.</p>

  <p>Chipcete in Irchenfield is the present Kilpeck, where William Fitz
    Norman sat in the seat of Cadiand, the dispossessed Englishman. The
    lands paid no geld or military service, which in that border district
    is remarkable. William was a large Herefordshire landowner. In 1134,
    25 Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Hugh, son of William Fitz Norman, gave to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter‚Äôs,
    Gloucester, the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David at Kilpeck, and the chapel of our
    Lady of or within the castle. Of the chapel no more is said, but the
    church is included in the confirmation charter by Stephen to Gloucester
    in 1138, and in many later confirmations and charters of Inspeximus.</p>

  <p>According to Dugdale, a priory was founded at Kilpeck in 1134, and
    dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David, by Henry de Kilpec. The founder more probably
    was Hugh Fitz Norman, who certainly endowed it. It was a cell of the
    Benedictine Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter at Gloucester, and subsisted until its
    suppression in 1422‚Äì48, during the Episcopate of Thomas Spofford of
    Hereford. The priors were summoned to take part in the elections of the
    Gloucester abbots.</p>

  <p>Hugh was succeeded by Henry, called ‚ÄúDe Kilpec,‚Äù who had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> pay a fine
    of 100 marks to King Stephen for a trespass on the royal forest of the
    Haywood. Henry is also mentioned in the Pipe roll of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> as in
    arrear 13 marks in 1189 for dues to the king from the forest of Trivel.</p>

  <p>John de Kilpec, son of Henry, purchased the barony of Purbeck or
    Pulverbach, Salop, of the Crown, in 1193 for ¬£100. At the commencement
    of John‚Äôs reign he seems to have held in his bailiwick the forests
    of Herefordshire, probably as sheriff of that county, for which he
    rendered his accounts in the third of John. He also paid two marks
    scutage for his lands in Salop. He died 1204, and Julian, his widow,
    paid 60 marks to King John to marry whom she pleased. In the following
    year she had dower of Rokeslegh and La Teme, according to Madox.</p>

  <p>By Julian John left Hugh de Kilpeck, who was a ward to William de
    Cantelupe, a great border baron. At this time the king visited Kilpeck
    occasionally, being there 1211, 11th March, in his way from Hereford
    to Abergavenny, no doubt at both places as Cantelupe‚Äôs guest. Also in
    1213, 27th and 28th November, he was here between Hereford and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Briavels, and finally 18th and 19th December, 1214, while going from
    Monmouth to Hereford.</p>

  <p>Hugh de Kilpeck, when of age, inherited the keepership of the royal
    forests in Herefordshire, and in 1248 he held Little Taynton, in
    Gloucestershire, by the serjeantry of keeping Haywood forest, also an
    hereditary charge. The forests of Hay, Kilpeck, and Acornbury seem,
    from the patent rolls, to have been in his hands 3 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> In 1231,
    16 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Hugh de Kilpeck and William Fitz Warine were two of the
    eight lords employed to negotiate a truce with Llewelyn. This seems
    positive; but Dugdale says he died about 1207. There is an inquisition
    upon him 28 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1243‚Äì4; but it appears from the fine rolls
    that he died before this. He married Egidia, who married afterwards,
    says Dugdale, William Fitz Warine. John was the third and last Baron
    Kilpeck. He left two daughters, co-heirs, Isabella and Joan. Joan, the
    younger, aged seventeen at her father‚Äôs death, was the first wife of
    Philip de Marmion. She held half the barony of Kilpeck, and left three
    daughters, co-heirs. Philip, who was champion of England and a great
    supporter of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, left by a second wife a fourth daughter. Each
    had a quarter of the barony of Marmion, and the elder three had each a
    third of that of Kilpeck. The Frevilles of Tamworth sprang from Mazera,
    the second child, and the Ludlows and Dymokes, champions, from Joan,
    the fourth.</p>

  <p>Isabella, the elder co-heir, seems to have held the castle of Kilpeck
    in her share. She married, 28 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, William Waleran. Her seal,
    lately found at Ewshot, near Crondall, is engraved in the ‚ÄúTop. and
    Geneal.,‚Äù i., <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 28, where is an excellent account of her family.
    Isabella left Robert, William, and Alice.</p>

  <p>Robert Waleran held Kilpeck. He was sheriff of Gloucestershire 30‚Äì35
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> He fought for Henry at Evesham, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> governor of the
    castles of Cardigan and Caermarthen, and a Baron. In 1262 he composed
    a dispute between the Bishop and Chapter and the citizens of Hereford
    relating to the assize of bread. He died <abbr title="sine prole"><i lang="la">s.p.</i></abbr> 1 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1273,
    leaving apparently Matilda, his widow, no doubt his second wife, who
    had dower in Kilpeck manor.</p>

  <p>William, brother of Hugh, died before him, leaving Robert, who
    succeeded to Kilpeck, but seems to have died 2 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, either
    childless, or leaving a son who did not inherit Kilpeck in consequence
    of his great uncle‚Äôs entail; for it appears that by deed in 1269 Robert
    Waleran gave to Alan de Plunkenet, his sister‚Äôs son, the reversion
    of Kilpeck castle and of the park of Treville and Coytmore, the
    forestership of the Hay, and the manor of Hampton. Alan regranted to
    Robert for life, and on Robert‚Äôs death the lands reverted to Alan, who
    did homage. By what tenure Robert, the nephew and last baron, held
    Kilpeck, does not appear.</p>

  <p>Alice Waleran, sister of the first Robert, married Auchew de la Bere.
    Their son Alan bore the name of Plukenet or Plugenet, and became lord
    of Kilpeck castle and manor, and was summoned to Parliament 23 Edward
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> He died 27 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1299. He was buried at Dore. He was a great
    agriculturist, and reclaimed the tract called from him ‚ÄúAlan‚Äôs Moor.‚Äù
    In his time, 13 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, William Butler held a carucate of land in
    Kilpeck and the manor and court there; also, 20 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Philip de
    Marmion of Scrivelsby held a fee in Kilpeck. Several fiefs seem to have
    been held of the castle; 2 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Alexander de Freville so held
    one-sixth of a fee.</p>

  <p>Alan Plugenet, son of Alan, succeeded. He was distinguished in the
    Scottish wars, and was also summoned to Parliament. He obtained a
    weekly market and annual fair for Kilpeck, and died <abbr title="sine prole"><i lang="la">s.p.</i></abbr> about
    1311, leaving his sister Joan his heir.</p>

  <p>Joan Plugenet, called Joan de Bohun de Kilpeck, held the barony. She
    married Edward de Bohun, but died <abbr title="sine prole"><i lang="la">s.p.</i></abbr> 20 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, or 1
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1327.</p>

  <p>Her heir was Richard, son of Richard, and grandson of Sir Richard de la
    Bere. He died 19 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, leaving Thomas, his son and heir, aged
    30, 27 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>; but Edward de Bohun, who survived his wife, and
    probably was tenant of Kilpeck by the courtesy, had licence from Edward
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> to alienate Kilpeck, Treville, and the bailiwick of the Haywood to
    James Butler, first Earl of Ormond.</p>

  <p>Meantime the elder family continued to hold their shares. Thomas de
    Useflete, 5 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, probably a trustee, enfeoffed Richard de la
    Bere, of Munestoke, in Kilpeck, which, 2 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, had been held by
    Nicholas de Useflete. 17 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Baldwin de Frevill held Kilpeck
    manor; and finally, 18 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Kinardus de la Bere held the manor
    and hundred of Kilpeck for the chantry of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary of Madley.</p>

  <p>The Butlers, however, seem to have been substantially the owners. 12
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, James, first Earl of Ormond, held the manor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> and extent by
    the tenure of keeping the forest of Hay, and 13 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Eleanor,
    his widow, held the castle and manor.</p>

  <p>As holders of the castle or manor, or both, appear‚Äî37 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Sir
    Thomas Moigne; 6 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, James, Earl of Ormond, and, 13 Richard
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Elizabeth, his widow. 20 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Sir Richard Talbot and
    Ankareta his wife held the castle and manor as one fee of James, Earl
    of Ormond, within the land of Irchenfield. The Butlers, however, held
    the castle until the attainder of the fifth earl, a Lancastrian, who
    was beheaded after Towton in 1467.</p>

  <p>In the fifteenth year of Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, the King granted Kilpeck in tail
    special to the male heirs of Sir W. Herbert, Lord Herbert (Earl of
    Pembroke), for one knight‚Äôs fee, and, 6 Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, this grant was
    extended in tail general, failing heirs male of the body. After the
    earl‚Äôs death, in 1469, Edward restored Kilpeck to the Butlers in the
    person of John, sixth Earl of Ormond, and it descended to his elder
    daughter and co-heir, whose son, Sir George <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leger, held it in 1545.</p>

  <p>After this it was sold, and came into the possession of the Pye family,
    of whom Sir Walter held the castle and park. He was a Royalist, and
    on the fall of Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the Parliament first garrisoned the castle,
    and in 1645 dismantled it. The Pyes followed James <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> into exile, and
    one of them bore the titular honour of Baron Kilpeck. Probably the
    materials of the castle were valuable, for their removal, with the
    trifling exceptions mentioned, has been complete, and yet the castle
    must have been a considerable place.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="KNARESBOROUGH_CASTLE_YORKSHIRE">KNARESBOROUGH CASTLE, YORKSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AMONG the various windings by which, still bearing its original
    British appellation, the river Nidd finds its way from its sources in
    Nidderdale and on the flanks of Whernside to its union with the Ouse a
    few miles above York, none are more remarkable than those by which it
    traverses the ancient forest of Knaresborough, where it lies within a
    deep ravine, celebrated, even in Yorkshire, for its happy combination
    of wood, and rock, and water.</p>

  <p>Near the middle of this part of its course a bold promontory of rock
    projects as a rugged cliff towards the stream, rising on its eastern
    bank to a height of about 230 feet. Two tributary ravines, to the north
    and south of the rock, isolate it from the adjacent high ground, and
    become broader and deeper as they descend towards the river, so that
    the rock is strongly fortified by nature upon its northern, southern,
    and western fronts. To complete the strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> of the position nothing
    was wanting but a ditch connecting the heads of the ravines and
    traversing the neck of the peninsula, and this was long since executed,
    and with it the upper parts of the ravines were also rendered deeper
    and broader, so that the position, before the use of gunpowder, must
    have been well-nigh impregnable.</p>

  <p>By whom, or by what people, this formidable platform was first turned
    to account, is unknown, but no inhabitants of the district to whom
    security was an object could have overlooked its advantages. There is,
    however, no actual evidence of either British or Roman occupation,
    unless the rectangular area fortified by bank and ditch still to be
    traced through the streets of the later town can be accepted, as at
    Tamworth and Wallingford, as the work of semi-Romanised Britons; a
    people who, having acquired some knowledge of the principles of Roman
    castrametation, were yet unwilling or unable to include their strong
    places within walls of masonry.</p>

  <p>The manor of Cnaresburg is mentioned in Domesday as the private demesne
    of the Conqueror, as it had been of the Confessor. Nothing is said of
    an ‚ÄúAula‚Äù or a castle there; but, as eleven Berewicks depended upon it,
    it is clear that it was, during, and probably long before, the time
    of Edward, the centre of a considerable estate, and if, as was usual,
    its early lord had there a fortified residence, it would naturally be
    placed upon the rugged and knotty platform that bore the descriptive
    name of Cnaresburg.</p>

  <p>William granted the manorial lands, returned in Domesday as ‚Äúwasta,‚Äù to
    Serlo de Burg, Burg being probably the manor now called Boroughbridge.
    Burg was a territorial designation, not a regular surname, and does
    not appear to have been used by the family. The Pipe Roll, 31 Henry
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1130, mentions Serlo as holding lands in Notts and Derby, and
    gives the names of Osbert, his son, and of another Osbert, his ‚Äúnepos‚Äù
    or nephew, both of whom seem to have died before their respective
    fathers. The successor and heir of Serlo was John the One-eyed, whose
    son, Eustace Fitz-John, was a Yorkshire Justiciar. He appears in the
    same Pipe Roll as farming Burg and Chenardesburg, and to him was
    then allowed ¬£11 for the king‚Äôs works, evidently upon the castle, at
    the latter place. Eustace married Beatrice, a De Vesci heiress, and
    their son William assumed that name. Richard FitzEustace, another
    son, married Albreda, the daughter and heir of Robert de Lisours, by
    Albreda, sister of Ilbert and Henry de Lacy, and aunt and heir of
    Robert de Lacy of Pontefract, who died childless, 1193. In consequence,
    Roger, Constable of Chester, the son of Richard FitzEustace and
    Albreda, took and transmitted the name of Lacy. Eustace had also a
    brother, Pain Fitz-John, a considerable Herefordshire landowner, and
    ancestor of the Barons FitzPain. With Eustace, who fell in the Welsh
    wars in 1159, the family occupation of the castle ceased, and it was
    from time to time granted by the Crown to various castellans. One of
    these, Hugh de Morville, took refuge here after the murder of Beckett.
    It was held also by the Estotevilles, and, in the reign of John, by
    Brian de Lisle, who is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> reputed to have excavated the castle ditch,
    and to have repaired or added to the buildings. Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> granted the
    castle to Hubert de Burgh in fee. Before that time the manor had been
    erected into an Honour, and the Honour, the Peculiar, and the forest
    of Knaresborough are from time to time the subject of royal grants. In
    1257, Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> gave them to his brother Richard, who founded a priory
    on the river bank below the castle. Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> repeated the grant to
    Gaveston, about which time the Slingsbys appear as keepers of the
    forest. In 1327, the castle was taken for the Earl of Lancaster, but
    only to be resumed by Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, who, in 1371, granted it to John of
    Gaunt, and it has ever since formed a part of the Duchy of Lancaster.
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> was imprisoned here in 1399, and the keep has since borne
    the name of the king‚Äôs tower, it is said, in consequence. In 1642 the
    castle was held for the king, and was the head-quarters of an active
    and somewhat unscrupulous body of soldiery. It was, in consequence,
    besieged and taken by Fairfax in 1644, and in 1648 was, by the Council
    of State, ordered to be slighted, which seems to have been effected by
    removing the curtain wall, and blowing away one angle of the keep.</p>

  <p>The castle occupied the whole area of the platform up to the edge of
    the ditch, the crest of the ravines, and the river cliff. In figure
    the plan is an irregular oval, in the proportion of about three parts
    east and west, to two parts north and south, and containing about 2¬Ω
    acres. Close south of, and dependent upon, the castle, was the town.
    The area within the line of the town ditch measures about 500 yards
    north-east and south-west by 850 yards north-west and south-east,
    and includes all the older part of the town. About 170 yards of the
    ditch, where it divided the castle from the town, has been filled up
    since the dismantling of the castle. The castle was contained within a
    great curtain wall 7 feet to 8 feet thick, and of the unusual height
    in places of from 30 feet to 40 feet. The keep forms a part of the
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, being built upon the crest and slope of the northern
    ravine, not far from the centre of that front. The curtain abutted
    upon its two ends, so that the building was partly within and partly
    outside the area. Connected with its southern angle are some fragments
    of masonry showing that the area was divided by a cross wall into an
    eastern and western part, the one being the outer and the other the
    inner ward, and the keep is so placed that its south-eastern face looks
    upon the outer, and its south-western and north-western faces upon the
    inner ward.</p>

  <p>Very nearly the whole both of the curtain and cross wall are gone,
    but the projection from the northern angle of the keep shows that the
    curtain, at that point at least, was about 40 feet high and at least
    11 feet thick. It would seem that the curtain had originally no mural
    towers, for these, in the shape of half-round or segmental solid
    buttresses, have been added, built against the face of the curtain,
    the removal of which has laid bare the rough face of the applied work.
    Leland speaks of eleven or twelve of these buttress towers. There
    remain at present only six. They have all been faced with ashlar.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>Upon one is a good stringcourse of Perpendicular date, and on another
    is seen the shaft of a garderobe, the upper part of which must have
    been on the battlements. Two of the largest of the buttresses are
    placed opposite to the town, about 21 feet apart, forming a sort of
    solid gatehouse, and flanking the main entrance to the castle through
    the outer ward. The gateway was 18 feet wide and at least 18 feet
    high to the springing. The arch is gone. The square groove for the
    portcullis remains, and within is a rebate for the door. Outside in
    the northern jamb is a hole as for the heel of a drawbridge, but there
    is no corresponding hole on the other side, so that the indication
    is probably deceptive. A drawbridge there must have been, but it was
    possibly more advanced. Leland also mentions a subterranean passage
    opening upon the slope of the ditch, but this, of which nothing is now
    known, was probably a sewer. In the inner ward is the house in which
    are still held the courts for the Honour. This is a modern building,
    but it contains an original Decorated doorway, and a large fireplace,
    plain, but probably of the same date. There is said to have been a well
    near this, now lost, and local tradition describes a chapel as having
    stood near the courthouse.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The principal interest of the building centres upon the King‚Äôs Tower
    or keep, of which the remains are considerable. It may be described
    as rectangular in plan, 64 feet north-west and south-east by 52 feet
    north-east and south-west, or nearly square. Its symmetry is, however,
    broken by the cutting off of the north angle. Also the whole of the
    eastern angle is gone, and it is a question how far out this extended,
    and with much of the north-east side, the whole south-east end, and
    the angle between them are gone, but enough of the two other sides
    remains to show the general plan and details of the building. [<a href="#i_172">B. Fig.
    <i>a.</i></a>]</p>

  <p>The western angle is capped by a cylindrical turret of solid masonry, 6
    feet diameter, and, at present, 52 feet high. It was probably, together
    with the main building, about 10 feet higher. This was the height from
    the level of the inner ward; the absolute height of the keep, measured
    from the dungeon floor, was about 16 feet more, or about 78 feet or 80 feet.</p>

  <p>The principal or south-west is also the most perfect front, and that
    which looks into the inner ward. It is here seen that the keep was
    composed of a sub-basement below the court level; a basement at the
    level; a first or main floor; and an upper floor: the lines of floor
    being indicated by two stringcourses or mouldings.</p>

  <p>The sub-basement consists only of the dungeon. [<a href="#i_171">A. Fig. <i>a.</i></a>] The
    entrance is by a sunken doorway, approached by a descending flight
    of steps. It is placed 14 feet from the western turret, and the top
    of the doorway arch shows just above the ground level. The doorway
    opens into a vaulted passage, down which twelve steps lead to a second
    doorway, that of the dungeon. This may be described as a square of 23
    feet, of which the two north-eastern angles are cut off, reducing one
    end to a sort of apse of three faces of 9 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> 6 inches each. In the
    centre is a plain cylindrical pier, 3 feet diameter, with a chamfered
    base, but no cap, from the head of which branch out twelve ribs, plain
    and substantial, with a slightly hollow chamfer. They are arranged in
    groups of three, separated by four rather wider openings, of which two,
    including the two right angles, are traversed by diagonal ribs, so that
    the plan of the vault is an octagon. There is an air-hole 3 feet square
    in the north wall, whence a passage, slightly zigzag, and 14 feet long,
    ended in a loop, now broken down. There seems also to have been a
    garderobe, as the mouth of a sewer is seen outside at the foot of the
    wall, 10 feet below the loop.</p>

  <p>The basement floor contains three chambers, entered from the inner ward
    by three doors. [<a href="#i_171">A. Fig. <i>b.</i></a>] Of these a narrow one of 2 feet
    opening placed close to the turret leads by a vaulted passage 3 feet
    long into the record-room. [<a href="#i_172">B. Fig. <i>a.</i></a>] This is an L-shaped
    chamber, of which the arms are 6 feet 6 inches broad, and on the longer
    sides 12 feet, and on the shorter 5 feet 6 inches, one limb being a few
    inches the larger. In the north-west wall is a loop for air. Each limb
    is crossed by a plain chamfered rib, and the square space thus formed,
    common to the two limbs, is crossed diagonally by a single rib. This
    chamber was recently used as a debtor‚Äôs prison.</p>

  <p>Next to the record-room, and nearer the centre of the front, is a large
    window, of which the ashlar casing and tracery have been removed, and
    the cill cut down to convert it into a door. At present the aperture is
    6 feet broad and 13 feet to the crown of the arch. Close to, but beyond
    this, is the original doorway, now blocked up, but quite perfect.
    It was of 5 feet opening with a low drop arch, and over it a good
    Decorated drip stone or hood moulding. This door led into the kitchen.
    [<a href="#i_172">B. Fig. <i>a.</i></a>]</p>

  <p>The kitchen may be described as a square of 24 feet, having applied to
    its north-east side an apse of three faces of 8 feet each; or it may be
    called a rectangle of 24 feet by 30 feet, with two of its angles cut
    off so as to form an apse.</p>

  <p>This chamber is also vaulted after a peculiar fashion. Twelve feet
    from the apsidal end is an octagonal pier, from the head of which
    spring eight ribs at equal angles. At 6 feet from the pier, that is,
    at the crown of the vault, each rib is met by two others, sixteen in
    number, which spring from eight half piers or responds in the angles of
    the wall. There are, however, actually only six of these wall piers,
    two being replaced by a different arrangement, rendered necessary by
    the oblong form of the chamber, which leaves a space 6 feet by 24
    feet to be covered in. Of this space one third, being the western
    angle, is solid, and, in fact, contains one limb of the record-room.
    The remainder is divided into two square bays, vaulted diagonally.
    Between this compartment and the larger one stands a second pier, which
    receives the thrust of three ribs from the main pier, and has five
    ribs besides of its own. The general result is not unpleasing, but
    the vaulting is exceedingly complex, containing eight <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>rhombs and
    eighteen triangles, great and small. The height to the crown of the
    vault is 12 feet. Besides the great window towards the inner ward is a
    small opening, probably a loop, though now enlarged, towards the ditch.
    The fireplace occupies one of the north-western bays. It is 7 feet
    broad, and the grate stood in a half-round recess of 3 feet 6 inches
    radius, with a vertical flue in the wall. From the kitchen open two
    smaller chambers and a well-stair. One of these, plainly vaulted, and
    11 feet by 7 feet, is placed in the south-east wall. It is entered by a
    small door from the side of the kitchen, and near the door is a loop,
    also looking into the kitchen. This was probably the cook‚Äôs bedroom.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A second chamber, 8 feet by 9 feet, also vaulted, is placed in the
    north wall, and is entered by a small and much mutilated doorway and a
    short oblique passage. This chamber has a loop towards the ditch, and a
    garderobe, the outlet from which seems to join that from the dungeon.</p>

  <p>The staircase is contained within the wall at the south angle of the
    chamber, and is lighted by two loops from the inner ward. It is entered
    from the kitchen by a small door opening into a straight passage,
    whence the well-staircase rises. This leads to both the first and
    second floor, and has a stone hand-rail carved in the wall. It is 2
    feet 6 inches radius.</p>

  <p>There remains only in the basement to be mentioned the Porter‚Äôs Lodge.
    [<a href="#i_172">B. Fig. <i>a.</i></a>] It is composed of a couple of cells, at present
    occupied by the keeper of the castle. The outer cell is entered by a
    small door very near to the passage between the outer and inner ward.
    The hollow angle formed by the junction of the cross wall with the keep
    is crossed by a squint, or oblique arch, which supports a bartizan
    turret above, and affords a sort of hood over the door. The outer cell,
    vaulted, measures 12 feet by 9 feet. One angle is filled up. There is
    a small two-light window towards the inner ward. From this cell a door
    opens into an inner cell, 7 feet by 8 feet, also vaulted, and with a
    small window or sort of loop, now broken down, which is formed in the
    south-east wall, and seems to have opened beneath the first arch of
    the bridge which carried the ascending road from the outer ward to the
    level of the first floor of the keep.</p>

  <p>The first or main floor of the keep presents its chief peculiarities.
    [<a href="#i_172">B. Fig. <i>b.</i></a>] It is, or was, a rectangular chamber 24 feet 6
    inches by 31 feet, and 19 feet high to the boarded floor of the room
    above. The north-west end, which is tolerably perfect, is wholly
    occupied by a segmental arched recess with a handsome moulding. It is
    2 feet 9 inches deep, and contains a sort of table or shelf 2 feet
    high and of 1 foot projection, the upper part of which is hollowed
    into a narrow trough, as though for animals to drink from, had it been
    a little broader. It is much broken, so it does not appear whether it
    was provided with a feed-pipe and drain. What it was intended for it is
    difficult even to guess. The wall is broken, and within it is seen the
    flue from the kitchen fireplace below. Above, a weather-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>moulding in
    the wall shows that at some time there was a low-pitched roof.</p>

  <p>Of the adjacent north-east side only about 12 feet remains. It is
    chiefly occupied by a large fireplace, 7 feet broad by 4 feet deep.
    It was flat-topped and quite plain. The wall has been broken down
    and the flue is disclosed. Next south of this is the jamb of a bold
    arched recess which runs through the wall, 14 feet deep, and must have
    contained a large window opening over the ditch.</p>

  <p>With the eastern angle is also gone the south-eastern side. Much
    of this must have been occupied by a large doorway, of which the
    south-west jamb remains, and its external and internal mouldings, in
    the Decorated style and of a very elaborate character. The wall was
    10 feet 6 inches thick, and in its centre, half-way between the two
    moulded arches, is a rectangular portcullis groove. It is evident that
    this was a regular gateway, fortified in the usual manner, and, as what
    remains of the arch shows, of a large size.</p>

  <p>The south-west wall, which is tolerably perfect, contains at its north
    end a door of the same size as that just described, saving that there
    is no portcullis, which, this being the inner gate, was not needed. The
    wall is here 11 feet thick, giving a very deep recess 10 feet broad,
    in which the doorway was placed. It is panelled and 15 feet high to
    the arch crown; the recess narrows to 7 feet 6 inches width, which was
    that of the doorway. The doorway is richly moulded, and the mouldings
    are continued down to the cill, showing that it was a door, and not,
    as some suppose, a window. There was, however, tracery in the head, of
    which a fragment remains, but not enough to show the pattern. In the
    jambs are a set of stanchion-holes, too large for the rods by which
    window-glass was usually supported, and which are evidently the remains
    of the bars inserted when the keep was used as a prison. The outermost
    hollow of the mouldings contains a band of delicate ball-flowers. There
    is also a handsome drip supported by two heads as corbels.</p>

  <p>Outside the doorway, in the wall on either hand, are two square
    grooves 7 inches broad and about 6 inches deep, and 11 feet apart.
    They commence at the stringcourse, which corresponds with the cill of
    the doorway, and are 6 feet high. Above this, 10 feet 6 inches from
    the stringcourse, and 12 feet apart, are two similar grooves, 7 feet
    6 inches long, and which, therefore, reach a little above the level
    of the top of the doorway arch. It is evident that these two pair of
    grooves were connected with the drawbridge, the lower pair probably
    receiving the ends of the parapet rail, and the upper the struts
    supporting the beams of the bridge.</p>

  <p>Next to this door recess, in the inside of the chamber, is a small
    plain fireplace, placed in a tall pointed recess, like a doorway, and
    beyond this again is a lower recess, but broader, and also pointed, in
    which is a plain, square-headed window, 4 feet high by 1 foot broad,
    looking towards the inner ward. In the jamb of the recess is a side
    door, leading by a short passage into the well staircase from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> the
    kitchen, which also, at this level, has a loop towards the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The floor of this chamber at present rises about 2 feet, or 1 in 26,
    from the outer to the inner gate. This, however, may be a modern
    arrangement, intended to carry off the water from the asphalt with
    which the floor has been paved.</p>

  <p>Outside the outer gate of this chamber, towards the south, is a small
    mural chamber, lighted by a very handsome window, 2 feet 6 inches
    broad, with tracery in the arched head and a handsome drip-stone
    above, looking towards the inner ward. This chamber opens upon a sort
    of lobby, now mostly destroyed, outside the great gate, and provided
    with a small doorway of its own, fitted with a portcullis, and from
    this descends a small staircase with a ribbed and vaulted roof,
    which communicated with the lodge connected with the entrance from
    the outer to the inner ward. This was evidently a postern for such
    foot-passengers as came after the great gates were closed, and who did
    not wish to enter the main or guard-chamber of the keep. From this
    lobby ascended a well-stair to the upper story, rather larger than the
    other one, which was close beside it in the wall. The position of the
    larger staircase is marked by a sort of bartizan or projecting round
    turret, which commenced at the first floor level, and was lighted from
    the inner ward. Most of this is broken away, and only traces of it
    remain.</p>

  <p>Of the upper floor but little remains save the wall towards the inner
    ward. In this wall is an excellent trefoil-topped window of one light
    beneath a square head. This is placed in a recess of the wall, vaulted
    and ribbed.</p>

  <p>Near it a small door opens upon the head of the staircase from the
    lower floor and the kitchen. The other staircase from the postern is
    destroyed.</p>

  <p>It appears from what has been described that the main floor of the keep
    was in fact a passage by which the principal entrance led from the
    outer to the inner ward. As the level of the first floor is 17 feet
    above that of the inner ward, and something more above that of the
    outer, the approaches were upon arches leading up to the gateways. The
    outer bridge no doubt was built against and protected by the curtain
    of the outer ward. That the road rested upon arches is evident from
    a trace of a skewback or springing stone below the gateway, and from
    the position of the window of the inner cell of the porter‚Äôs lodge.
    There is similar evidence of another bridge from the inner gateway down
    to the level of the inner ward, and excavation there would probably
    show the pier bases. How there came to be two fireplaces in what must
    have been the guard-chamber, and what was the use of the trough, are
    questions as yet unanswered. So far as I know, this is the only example
    of a main entrance so raised and carried through the keep. This keep
    is, in fact, a gatehouse.</p>

  <p>There remains to be noticed the fragment of a building attached to the
    southern angle of the keep, and from which evidently sprang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> the wall
    which ran between the outer and the inner ward. [<a href="#i_172">B. Fig. <i>a.</i></a>]
    This seems to have been an oblong, divided into two compartments.
    One, of which much of two sides remains, was 11 feet square, vaulted
    and ribbed, the fans spreading from the four angles. This was entered
    on one side from a small Decorated door of 2 feet 3 inches opening,
    which led into a bent passage. The face towards the inner ward seems
    to have contained a second small door, by the side either of a window
    or a larger door. From this chamber a door probably led, through the
    second chamber, now removed, to the base of the winding steps already
    mentioned as ascending to the eastern entrance to the keep. The designs
    of the mouldings of this appended building are peculiarly delicate and
    graceful, and well executed.</p>

  <p>This keep is probably the latest example of a rectangular keep as
    well as a singular one of a keep with its main floor employed as
    a gatehouse. Its ornaments and details generally are in the late
    Decorated style, and of the reign probably of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, though it is
    by no means likely that the work was due to Gaveston. Ashlar masonry
    is freely employed outside and inside the building, and the details
    throughout are admirable. It is probable that the addition of the solid
    buttresses to the curtain was the work of the builder of the keep. The
    masonry and material correspond. The portcullis grooves are alike, and
    the solitary stringcourse on one of the bastions is nearly, if not
    quite, of the pattern of that employed on the keep. It is much to be
    desired that the inhabitants of Knaresborough would obtain the castle
    as a promenade, reopen the ditch, or part of it, restore the bridge
    leading to the outer gate, excavate the foundation of the north-east
    angle of the keep and of the bridge covering the way into the prison,
    and check the progress of weather and exposure in the upper portions of
    the keep. A moderate sum would execute all that is required, and the
    result would add to the comfort and augment the attractions of the town.</p>

  <hr class="h20" />
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="LEEDS_OR_LEDES_CASTLE_KENT">LEEDS, OR LEDES, CASTLE, KENT.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">LEEDS Castle is a very peculiar structure. It stands upon three rocky
    knolls, of which two are islands in a lake of 15 acres, and the
    third occupies the central part of the artificial bank by which, as
    at Kenilworth and Caerphilly, and in some degree at Framlingham and
    Ragland, the waters are or were retained.</p>

  <p>The central and larger island is girt by a revetment wall, having
    half-round bastions, and rising about 15 feet out of the water. This
    was the wall of the outer ward. About 40 feet within, and concentric
    with this, are indications of the wall of the inner ward, which was
    about 8 feet thick and 20 feet high. At each end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> connecting the two
    walls, and occupying the space between them, were the gatehouses, of
    which that to the south remains, and is a very curious structure. It
    represents, probably, a late Norman work; but its oldest recognisable
    part is a doorway of the time of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, surrounded, however, by
    masonry apparently of that of Edward, his son. A bretache is mentioned
    in a Survey of 1314, but the present corbels overhanging the gateway,
    and upon which the timber work rested, appear to be of the age of
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and probably date from 1386. The Constable‚Äôs room, placed
    in the rear, and at the level of the portcullis chamber, is entered
    through a doorway, the valve of which is original and peculiar, being
    composed of planks of a taper section, the narrow edge of one fitting
    into a groove in the back or broad edge of the next.</p>

  <p>The domestic buildings occupied the north end of the two wards, and are
    replaced by a modern house, excepting only a vaulted cellar, which may
    be late Norman, and is certainly the oldest known masonry in the place,
    and a bracket which supported the ancient oven, and is placed near what
    (17 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>) is described as ‚Äú<span lang="la">Una coquina juxta pedem pontis de la
    Gloriet</span>,‚Äù which kitchen was not long since removed.</p>

  <p>In this ward also, or rather partly in this and partly in the outer
    ward, near a building of the age of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, is a very remarkable
    bath,‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">balnea domini regis apud Ledes</span>,‚Äù as it is designated, which was
    constructed for the use of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> in 1291‚Äì2. This is now used as
    a boathouse. It communicates with the lake by a passage in which are
    still seen the grooves for the portcullis, and the recesses for the
    oblique gates by means of which the water was retained or excluded. Mr.
    Wykeham Martin‚Äôs investigations of the accounts relating to this bath
    are very curious. The hundred Reigate stones, 2 feet square, which are
    there specified, just tally with the area of the chamber.</p>

  <p>Thus far the castle is, or has been, a concentric structure, after
    the plan much in use in the latter part of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    and throughout that of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> Its peculiarities are caused by the
    circumstances of its position, and remain to be described. Of these the
    chief is the keep, or Gloriette, a shell of wall rising from the deep
    water around it to a considerable height, and containing apartments
    round a central court, an arrangement usual in Norman shell keeps.
    This shell contains the chapel, no doubt the ‚Äúmajor capella‚Äù of the
    records, the kitchen, and amidst much work of the date at least of
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, more that is of that of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, and even of recent
    date. This island is thought to have been the original stronghold of
    those who first appropriated the spot, but the oldest work now seen
    dates from Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and the style of the chapel points to about
    1280. It contains, however, an excellent low side window, open 17 feet
    above the water, probably an insertion by Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> There is also
    a postern at the level of the water, part of which appears old, as
    does an adjacent garderobe. The basement, by which the ground-floor is
    raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> about 12 feet above the water, is solid, and probably very old,
    for no occupant of these islands for the purpose of security could have
    neglected this site. Edward, no doubt, remodelled this work with the
    rest of the castle, and possibly rebuilt the whole of the outer wall.
    Sir Henry Guildford, custos here for Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, seems to have removed
    part of the earlier building, and to have built a spacious hall, a
    large fragment of which is the present kitchen. During the reign of
    Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> these additions were much injured by fire, so that most of
    the buildings next the court are modern. Still the general type and
    arrangement was evidently preserved; and there is little doubt but that
    this structure represents a late Norman shell, if not an earlier Saxon
    house of timber. A handsome clock-tower, to which the term Gloriette is
    sometimes confined, contains a very early clock, and is of the date of
    Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, guarding the covered bridge which connects the keep with
    the larger island. This bridge is of two openings, and has two stories,
    and was originally a drawbridge, the pit being contained between the
    side walls, and dropping into the water. It is called in the accounts
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">pons gloriett√¶</span>.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The term ‚ÄúGloriette‚Äù is not of frequent occurrence, and its meaning has
    not been precisely defined.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was first brought under notice in the
    ancient miscellanea of the Exchequer relating to Corfe Castle, amongst
    which Mr. Bond cites a document dated 8 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, that mentions
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Camera que vocatur Gloriette</span>.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was probably like ‚ÄúButavant‚Äù and
    ‚ÄúCocaygne,‚Äù one of the towers of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the castle,
    and may have been of somewhat greater elevation. Scarcely any vestiges
    remain. The name seems sometimes to denote the whole of the buildings
    near the Queen‚Äôs Tower and Hall; in that part of the castle there
    existed a chapel called the chapel of the Gloriette. It appears that
    the Gloriette tower at Corfe was newly built by Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, about
    1379.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Amongst the conventual buildings also of Christ Church,
    Canterbury, there was a ‚ÄúNew Lodgyng, juxta antiquam Priorum mansionem
    vocatam Le Gloriet.‚Äù Professor Willis informs us that it was the upper
    chamber at the north end of the range of buildings, known as the
    ‚ÄúPrivata Camera,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrior‚Äôs Mansion.‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A building on an elevated
    spot in the palace grounds at Sch√∂nbrunn, commanding an extensive view
    of Vienna, is called ‚ÄúLa Gloriette.‚Äù</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p>The third great division of the castle, also very peculiar, is the
    barbican, or t√™te-de-pont, which is placed on the counterscarp of the
    lake, here reduced to 50 feet in width, and at the outer end of the
    bridge which carries the road of approach into the great island. It is
    composed of three parts, which were isolated by three wet ditches, of
    which one is the river Len, and having three entrances, one from each
    wing of the dam, and one, the main one, central, from the south. Each
    approach had its drawbridge, gateway, and portcullis, and the three met
    upon a small central plot, open towards the fortress, and whence sprung
    the bridge leading up to the great gateway. This is the bridge that was
    broken down by the great horses and heavy wagons of Aymer de Valence.
    It is of two arches, the inner of which was open between the parapets
    for the pit of the drawbridge. One division of the barbican contains
    the mill, a strongly-fortified building, in advance of which were the
    barriers which are known to have covered the southern approach, and to
    have been standing in 1385. They were no doubt mainly of timber, though
    there are traces of foundations in masonry. This triple composition of
    a barbican has not been elsewhere observed. The object of its lateral
    gates was the defence of the dam, which might otherwise have been
    mined and cut through. Also those who came either from the east or
    the west could only have reached the south gate by a wide detour, for
    the causeway along the dam was defended on the outside as well as the
    inside by water, the lake to the south-east being of large area, and
    known as the ‚Äú<span lang="la">stagnum exterius</span>,‚Äù while, to the south-west, was a deep
    watercourse and marsh formed by the Len.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Wykeham Martin, whose investigations of his hereditary
    fortress were a labour of love, seems to have established firmly,
    on sound critical grounds, the date of its several parts. He shows
    the high probability of its occupation by at least a Saxon lord, and
    the changes it has undergone from the Crevec≈ìurs, Leyburns, and the
    Plantagenet and Tudor monarchs, who, from Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> to Edward <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, held
    it in possession.</p>

  <p>Like many Saxon strongholds, Leeds is thought to date from the ninth
    century. It was held, probably by a Norman arrangement, by castle-guard
    tenure under Dover. To Bishop Odo, who obtained it at the Conquest, is
    attributed some Norman work in the church, but the earliest masonry
    in the castle, probably represented by the curious vaulted cellar,
    is thought to be the work of Robert de Crevec≈ìur, who founded Leeds
    Priory in 1119, and afterwards removed three canons into the chapel
    of his castle. A later Robert shared in the defeat of Lewes, and
    was in consequence obliged to yield up Leeds in exchange with Roger
    de Leyburn, a powerful Kentish baron, father of that William whose
    unscrupulous boldness is well described in the Roll of Caerlaverock,
    which designates him as ‚ÄúA valiant man, without ‚Äòbut‚Äô or ‚Äòif.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

  <p>Out of the disputes between the dispossessed and the dispossessor
    Edward seems to have established a title by the strong hand. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> gave
    to the fief the character of a royal manor, was a frequent visitor at
    the castle, and appears to have completely remodelled the fortress of
    the Crevec≈ìurs, giving it the aspect which in many points it presents
    at this day. By Edward it was settled upon the queen, part of whose
    funeral charges were incurred here in 1291. Here also the king founded
    a chantry in the castle chapel for her soul‚Äôs health, and it was about
    this time that he caused the bath to be constructed.</p>

  <p>Upon Edward‚Äôs second marriage Leeds was again settled upon his queen,
    and for several reigns this continued with some exceptions to be the
    practice. It was also much used for the reception of visitors of
    distinction who rested here on their way from Dover to London.</p>

  <p>In 1321 the king‚Äôs defences were put upon their trial. The castle seems
    to have passed by an exchange to Bartholomew de Badlesmere, a great
    lord, who in 1321 was away in the North plotting with other barons the
    fall of Despenser, while his wife and children remained in the castle,
    the Constable being a certain Walter Colepeper.</p>

  <p>One night in midsummer, Queen Isabella, with a large retinue, presented
    herself at the gates demanding hospitality. The Constable, dreading her
    designs, boldly refused it. ‚ÄúNor queen, nor any other, should enter
    without his lord‚Äôs order.‚Äù The ‚ÄúShe-wolf of France‚Äù ordered an instant
    attack, in which several of her people were killed, whose skeletons,
    bearing marks of violence, have recently been discovered before the
    barbican. The attack failed, and her Grace had to lodge as best she
    might outside. Of course, this event had its consequences. The king
    proclaimed a levy <i lang="fr">en masse</i> through four counties and raised
    besides the ‚Äú<span lang="la">posse comitatus</span>‚Äù of Kent. The muster place was Leeds
    Castle, the day the 23rd of October. Thither at the appointed time came
    the king and his brother and a large force, the command of which was
    given to Aymer de Valence, who pressed the siege vigorously. Badlesmere
    attempted a diversion, also by the display of a force, much inferior,
    however, in numbers, at Kingston, where he was on the 28th of October.
    All attempts at a negotiation between Badlesmere and the king failed.
    The castle held out till the 1st of November, when this, its only known
    siege, ended in a surrender, apparently to the king in person. The
    brave Constable and twelve others were hanged, and Lady Badlesmere and
    her family committed to the Tower. It was thought that the execution
    of Badlesmere himself, when taken afterwards at Boroughbridge, was
    partly in revenge for his having, in writing, sanctioned Colepeper‚Äôs
    resistance.</p>

  <p>Edward, having thus recovered the castle, was frequently there, his
    last visit being on the 15th of June, 1326.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> settled the castle upon his queen, and it was placed with
    other royal buildings under the surveyorship of William of Wykeham, who
    in 1359 seems to have laid out ¬£16. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> upon it, of which sum ¬£5
    went to replace glass windows blown in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> by a hurricane, 24<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> to repair
    Aymer de Valence‚Äôs injuries to the bridge, and 70<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> was spent upon the
    old chapel. In 1367 occurs a curious charge for habergeons, basnets,
    and other harness for a body of archers, for materials for making
    armour, and for the carriage of two beds from Leeds to Canterbury
    for the use of the Count of Flanders, and of six to Leeds from
    Sittingbourne. The castle cannot boast of any attentions from Edward
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> in person.</p>

  <p>Leeds formed a part of the settlement of Anne of Bohemia, the queen of
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, who was himself much here. A list of the military stores
    of the place in 1385 is preserved, and includes the following curious
    items relating to the defences of the great gate or barbican:‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">Duas
    portas nudas vocatas portes colys, et viginti pikes cum viginti platis
    de ferro, quatuordecem platas de ferro longas, viij platas de ferro
    curtas, centum sexaginta et quinque clavos de ferro pro eisdem portis
    dictis portes colys novo ferrando, unum circulum ferreum pro barreris
    juxta molendinum, unum magnum crowe, unum parvum crowe de ferro, unum
    magnum slegge, unum parvum slegge, unam magnam cathenam, unam parvam
    cathenam, sex forcipes, unum vertinuel, sex vyles, unum cable, unum
    nayltol,</span>‚Äù etc. The ‚Äú<span lang="la">nud√¶ port√¶</span>‚Äù were, of course, open timber gratings
    upon which the iron was to be plated. The barriers near the mill show
    them to have been in advance of the centre entrance, and the crows,
    sledge hammers, chains, and files would all be necessary for the
    setting up of portcullis or drawbridge.</p>

  <p>Ten years later, 15th of July, 1395, Richard from hence despatched the
    proxies who were to plight his troth to the French king‚Äôs daughter,
    and at the same time received a visit from Froissart, who was a great
    favourite, and accompanied the king to Eltham, where he was to discuss
    the French match with the magnates of the realm.</p>

  <p>It was also at Leeds, and at the same time, that Richard signed two
    mandates, one for the expulsion of the Lollards from Oxford, and the
    other directing the University to sit in judgment upon the ‚ÄúTrialogus‚Äù
    of Wycliffe. Leeds was also one of the places to which Richard was
    carried after his deposition.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> was at Leeds in 1401, but he seems to have granted the
    castle to Archbishop Arundel, who thence followed up Richard‚Äôs edicts
    against the new heresy, by citing in 1413 Sir John Oldcastle to appear
    before him in ‚Äúthe greater chapel of Leeds Castle,‚Äù where also, on his
    non-appearance, he passed upon him for contumacy the sentence which led
    to his martyrdom in the following reign.</p>

  <p>In that reign, 4 Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>, 1416, Leeds gave hospitality to the Emperor
    Sigismund on his return from London to Dover, when its resources must
    have been taxed to house the very splendid retinue provided for him.
    Two years later a royal but enforced visitor here was Joan, mother of
    the Duke of Brittany and stepmother to the king. Her stay at this time
    as a prisoner was short, but she resided here after her liberation in
    the next reign.</p>

  <p>On the accession of Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, Katherine of Valois was put in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
    possession of Leeds, but Henry was there in 1436‚Äì1438, and ordered
    certain repairs to the roof of the keep. In 1441, Duchess Eleanor of
    Gloucester was tried for sorcery in the chapel by Archbishop Chichele.</p>

  <p>Under Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> Leeds ceased to be assigned to the queen consort, and
    remained vested in the king, but the castle was no longer visited by
    royalty, and seems to have been allowed to fall into decay until the
    reign of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, under whom Sir Henry Guildford resided here, and
    seems to have made considerable alterations, especially in the keep.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> alienated Leeds from the Crown in favour of Sir Anthony <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Leger about 1550, whose descendants, after 1618, sold it to Richard
    Smith of the Strangford ancestry, whose heir, after 1631, resold it
    to Thomas Colepeper of the family of the former constable. The Smith
    occupation was marked by the construction of a handsome Elizabethan
    mansion at the north end of the larger island. The Colepepers, created
    barons in 1644, farmed the castle, in 1655, to the Government for the
    safe keeping of about 600 French and Dutch prisoners, under the general
    charge of John Evelyn, who records himself to have ‚Äúflowed the dry
    moat, made a new drawbridge, and brought spring water into the court of
    the castle to an old fountain.‚Äù The prisoners, however, much damaged
    the building and set fire to part of the keep.</p>

  <p>The Colepeper heiress carried the estate to her husband Thomas, fifth
    Lord Fairfax. Robert, the seventh lord, repaired the dwelling-house and
    laid out the park, and here, in 1778, entertained George <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> and his
    queen, the latest of very many royal visits to the place.</p>

  <p>Lord Fairfax left the castle to his sister‚Äôs son, Dr. Martin, known
    later as Dr. Fairfax, who died 1800, and was succeeded by his brother,
    General Martin, on whose death, in 1821, it descended to Fiennes
    Wykeham, representative of the younger branch of the Wykehams of
    Swalcliff, where they held lands as early as the Domesday Survey, and
    whose son, Charles Wykeham Martin, was the author of the history of the
    castle.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="LEICESTER_CASTLE">LEICESTER CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE town of Leicester stands upon moderately high ground, and on its
    western side is divided by a narrow valley from the opposite elevations
    of Glenfield and Braunstone. This valley gives passage to the Soar,
    the river of the county, which, flowing northwards, meanders through
    the meadows of the Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Pratis, and thus, before
    agriculture had drained these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> lands, securely covered the western and
    northern, and, to a certain extent, the southern fronts of this very
    ancient and once well-fortified place.</p>

  <p>Down the western valley, but outside the stream, and along the edge of
    the higher ground, was carried the Fossway, which thus, on its passage
    from Bennones or High Cross towards Lincoln, left the old Roman ‚Äú<span lang="la">Rat√¶
    Coritanorum</span>,‚Äù known to us as Leicester, about a furlong to its east.</p>

  <p>Whether Rat√¶ be an original Roman, or a Latinised British name, is
    uncertain. Ratcliffe and Ratby occur in the district, and at the latter
    is a large camp of doubtful origin. Upon the language to which ‚ÄúRat‚Äù
    belongs, depends the question of the British origin of the town.</p>

  <p>Rat√¶, if not founded, was occupied and fortified, by the Romans. The
    line of the wall, on the usual rectangular plan, has been traced upon
    the north, south, and east sides, the western defence being formed by
    the river, and both city and suburb are fruitful in pavements and other
    Roman remains. There is, however, some doubt as to whether the wall
    actually reached the water at the south-west angle. If, as is supposed,
    though upon very insufficient evidence, the fragment of Roman masonry
    known as the Jewry wall was really a part of the town wall, it follows
    that the wall was present on the west side, and there was a space
    between that defence and the river, and that the castle, which occupies
    the south-west angle, was outside the town.</p>

  <p>Rat√¶, under the name of Leicester, was also a town of great importance
    among the Saxons, and was nearly central in the kingdom of Mercia. It
    is mentioned in a Saxon charter of 819, and is said to have given the
    title of earl to Leofric, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 716, to Algar in 838, and to
    other Algars and other Leofrics, and to Leofwin, the Saxon line ending
    with Earl Edwin, who was slain in 1071. The town, during the Danish
    interregnum, was one of the five burghs; and the castle, like those of
    Tamworth and Tutbury, is said to have been either founded or restored
    by √Üthelfl√¶d in 913‚Äì4, though for this solid evidence is wanting.
    Nevertheless, that Saxon Leicester was the seat of a very important
    earldom is very certain, and the residence of the lords was most
    probably the castle.</p>

  <p>The town and castle were placed by the Conqueror in charge of Hugh de
    Grentmaisnil, lord of the neighbouring Honour and castle of Hinkley,
    where also is a fine mound; and whose son Yvo was vice-comes of the
    county under Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> The actual property of the Grentmaisnils, in
    Leicester, was one-fourth of the town; but it does not appear how this
    and much more of the other parts were acquired by Robert de Bellemont,
    Earl of Mellent, who became Earl of Leicester, and died 1118, in
    possession of the castle and Honour. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Juxta et infra castellum</span>,‚Äù which
    may conveniently be rendered, ‚Äúoutside, but just beneath the castle
    wall,‚Äù was a collegiate church, of Saxon foundation, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Mary. This Robert was probably the builder, between 1106 and 1118,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> of
    the castle, including the hall, the chapel, and a tower upon the mound.</p>

  <p>Robert Bossu, the second earl, took the part of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> He
    strengthened and enlarged the castle. He was the founder of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary
    de Pratis, outside the town; and, to endow this, he diminished the
    ecclesiastical staff, and diverted some of the lands from his father‚Äôs
    foundation by the castle. He died 1167.</p>

  <p>Robert Blanchmains, his son, the third earl, married Petronilla,
    the heiress of the Grentmaisnils, his predecessor at Leicester, and
    with her obtained Hinkley, Groby (where also is a mound), and other
    possessions. He is reputed to have enlarged and strengthened the
    castle, and his constable, Anketel Mallory, held it against Henry
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> until he surrendered it by the earl‚Äôs command. Also Mallory
    surrendered, on the same day, the castles of Groby and Mountsorrell.
    Both castle and town were taken, the town wall was demolished, and
    it is said that the part between the north and east gates was never
    rebuilt.</p>

  <p>Robert Fitzparnell, the fourth earl, died childless in 1204, when
    Leicester Castle, and in 1206 the earldom, came to Simon de Montford,
    who had married Amicia, his sister and co-heir. Upon the death at
    Evesham of their son Simon in 1264, and his attainder, the earldom
    and castle were granted to Edmond, second son of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Earl of
    Leicester and Lancaster, and the castle has since descended with the
    Lancaster property, and is still a part of the duchy of that name.</p>

  <p>Henry, Earl of Lancaster and Leicester, founded the Hospital of the
    Newark contiguous to the castle in 1322, and the works were completed
    by Henry, his son, Duke of Lancaster, in 1354. The hospital contained
    four acres. It reached the river, and covered the castle on the south
    side, and at this time one approach to the castle is across the Newark,
    through its handsome gatehouse.</p>

  <p>The earls and dukes of Lancaster must have restored the castle, as they
    resided here very frequently, and with their usual display. When John
    of Gaunt granted certain privileges to the city in 1376, he reserved
    the castle and its mill, and the rents and services of the castle
    court, and its office of porter. In the castle he entertained Richard
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and his queen with great splendour in 1390.</p>

  <p>In 1414, when Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> held a Parliament in the hall of the Grey
    Friars, he resided at the castle, and it was in the great hall of the
    castle that was held the Parliament of 1425‚Äì6, the Commons meeting
    in an apartment below it, which, however, could scarcely be the case
    literally, as the hall is on the ground level. It is just possible that
    the modern brick vaults and cells constructed under the floors of the
    hall for the purposes of police may replace an older substructure, into
    which opened the existing cellar.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> was here in 1426, and in 1444 the castle and Honour were
    included in his marriage settlement. In 1450 a third Parliament was
    held at Leicester, but whether in the castle hall is not recorded.
    Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> was here in 1463 and 1464, but from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> period the castle
    seems to have been neglected, and to have fallen into great decay.</p>

  <p>Leland, who visited Leicester about 1512, says,‚Äî‚ÄúThe castelle stonding
    nere the west bridge is at this tyme a thing of small estimation, and
    there is no apparaunce other [either] of high waulles or dykes. So that
    I think that the lodgings that now be there were made sins the tyme of
    the Barons‚Äô war in Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> tyme, and great likelyhood there is that
    the castelle was much defaced in Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> tyme, when the waulles of
    Liercester were defacid.‚Äù (<abbr title="Itinerary">Itin.</abbr>, <abbr title="1">i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16.)</p>

  <p>Speed gives a rough perspective view of the castle and town, which,
    however, is very indistinct as regards the former. In 1633 Mr. Herrick,
    of Beaumanor, was directed by the king to remove the ruinous parts
    and sell their material; to repair the castle house, which contained
    the records of the Honour of Lancaster, and to preserve the vaults
    and stairs leading to it, for the use of the keep of the castle. Upon
    this an inquisition was taken in 1633‚Äì4, and the value recorded of the
    materials, ‚Äúexcepting the Sessions Hall and the vault under the old
    castle, and the stairs leading to it.‚Äù This inquisition gives several
    details, chiefly of parts now removed; and mentions as to be repaired
    ‚ÄúJohn of Groat‚Äôs kitchen, divers outhouses belonging to the Great
    Sessions Hall, and the ruinous pieces at the south end of the same
    hall; also the south gate, and the wall from this gate to the Soar,
    which divides the castle from the Newark; also a wall next the porch of
    the church.‚Äù By ‚Äúkeep‚Äù is no doubt meant the hall. The south gate and
    wall to the Soar remain, as does a wall next the (south) porch of the
    church.</p>

  <p>In the civil wars, the castle was held for the king. It then fell to
    the Parliament; was retaken by the king in 1645, and finally yielded
    to the Parliament after Naseby. In the struggles the south gate was
    probably reduced to its present ruined condition.</p>

  <p>In 1781, Mr. Rogers Ruding had a lease of the premises from the duchy,
    which specifies the south gate evidently that remaining towards the
    Newark, the castle house, several tenements, the mount, and the
    appendages to the castle, and stipulates for the holding of sessions in
    the great hall.</p>

  <p>The castle stands at the south-western angle of the town, upon ground
    close to, and about 20 feet above, the right bank of the Soar, the
    three channels of which unite below the castle. The nearest of these
    streams is the artificial leat which supplied the castle mill, and does
    still supply its modern representative. From the line of the castle
    wall the ground slopes rapidly, and terminates in a strip of level land
    that forms the margin of the mill leat, therein closely resembling the
    river front of Taunton Castle on the Tone.</p>

  <p>The castle seems to have been composed of a mound on its south-west
    quarter; a hall and other buildings on the west or river front; the
    church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Castro opposite to the hall; and on the east side
    a gatehouse between the church and the mound; another gatehouse close
    north of the church, and a wall which runs east of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> the church, and
    forms a part of the eastern boundary of its churchyard. There is also
    the mill which, though modern, covers the ancient site.</p>

  <p>The area within which these remains are included is known as ‚ÄúThe
    Castle View.‚Äù This evidently represents the precinct of the Norman, and
    probably of the Saxon castle, and has been preserved as a distinct and,
    in part, extra-parochial district, vested in the duchy of Lancaster.
    The Castle View is nearly square, and may include four or possibly five
    acres. In 1861 it was returned as ‚ÄúThe Liberty of the Castle View,‚Äù and
    contained 29 houses and 131 persons. The boundaries are the line of the
    ancient circumscribing ditch, or nearly so. On the south they divide
    the castle from the Newark, just including the mound. On the east they
    take the line from the present south gatehouse, by the old wall, and
    thence by the edge of the road down to the mill, including the house
    and garden attached to the Sessions House. The ditch is everywhere
    filled up, but in the garden north of the Hall the line of the wall is
    marked by a step of from 8 to 10 feet.</p>

  <p>This line includes <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs, which was once the collegiate church
    or chapel of the castle. If it be that the castle was enlarged by
    Robert Bossu, it is probable that the older defence just excluded the
    church, and took the line of the present upper gatehouse, cutting off
    the churchyard and church, and placing the latter ‚Äú<span lang="la">juxta et infra</span>‚Äù the
    castle wall. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs was made parochial in 1400, the rest of the
    View remaining extra parochial, and it is not impossible that this was
    a restoration to the church of its ecclesiastical position before it
    was included within the Norman military precinct.</p>

  <p>The mound, though broad, is at present less lofty than is usual in the
    more important Saxon castles, having been lowered 40 years ago by 12
    or 15 feet. It is now about 30 feet high and 100 feet diameter upon
    its circular top, which is quite flat, without a trace of old building
    upon it. It has now no ditch, and is connected with no ancient wall;
    but, though probably within the ancient <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, it may, as at
    Warwick and Tamworth, have actually formed a part of it. The original
    well still remains in the mound and is in use.</p>

  <p>The present hall was a part of the castle proper. It is an oblong
    structure, like Oakham and Winchester, composed of a nave and two
    narrow aisles. The nave lies north and south, and is about 60 feet
    by 25 feet, having gables at either end, and an open high-pitched
    roof. Since 1633, and perhaps earlier, it has been used for judicial
    purposes, and divided into three parts,‚Äîa civil and criminal court,
    and between them an entrance lobby, and above it a grand-jury room. To
    enlarge the courts, the old oaken posts or piers, with carved Norman
    caps, have been removed, the east aisle rebuilt or cased, and the west
    aisle walled off for retiring-room and passages. Its older parts also
    are concealed by panelling and partition-walls. The original south
    wall of the nave remains. In it are two round-headed windows, resting
    upon a string-course, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> set-off in the wall, with a plain chamfered
    moulding. The windows are small and plain, and the recesses have but
    little splay. These are flanked by two slender detached octagonal
    shafts, possibly replacing cylindrical ones, with Norman capitals, and
    the head of each recess is surrounded by a single bold band of chevron
    moulding. There is a third and small window above, near the apex of the
    gable, with a recess of about 2 feet opening, all quite plain. Below is
    a small Norman door, but apparently a very recent insertion. It may,
    however, represent a way into the kitchen, which was at this end.</p>

  <p>The opposite or north end wall, forming the side of the civil court,
    appears also to be old, but is so plastered and pointed as to be
    inscrutable from the inside. It contains a large round-headed window,
    probably a modern insertion. From the outside the base of the wall
    seems original, and there is the jamb of a window in end of the east
    aisle.</p>

  <p>The wall of the west aisle, towards the river, is original, and is
    flanked at each end by a buttress, probably of Decorated date. In
    drawings of the last century this building is shown as an aisle, but
    it has been raised, and now forms a judge‚Äôs retiring-room behind each
    court, and a staircase between them. In the basement are offices. This
    aisle contains one original window near the south end, flat pointed,
    with plain jambs, and a head adorned by a single chevron band. The
    jambs have been renewed in brick.</p>

  <p>The hall-floor is on the ground level, but it has been largely
    excavated, and now contains a number of cells and vaulted passages to
    them beneath the court. These vaults show nothing ancient.</p>

  <p>Until recently there were some small inferior buildings at the south
    end of the court. These are now replaced by a barristers‚Äô room. The
    kitchen stood here till 1715, when it was removed. Beneath the site
    of the kitchen is a very fine vault, perhaps 40 feet long by 15 feet
    wide, the west wall of which is the original outer wall of the castle.
    The vault is of excellent ashlar, slightly four-centred and evidently
    Perpendicular work. At the north end is a door, now walled up, steps
    beyond which led up to the hall. At the other end is also a door. This
    was evidently a cellar and a fine one.</p>

  <p>In the garden north of the hall, no doubt, stood the principal
    apartments of the old castle. Here was the Castle House of the
    seventeenth century. Norman rectangular keep there was certainly none.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse towards the Newark opens from the castle, its front being
    outwards. It is small, having a portal passage, a lodge, and a turnpike
    stair, and on the upper floor, now a ruin, a portcullis chamber, and
    two other rooms. Its arches are four-centred. It has the broad hollow
    moulding of the Perpendicular period, and a square portcullis groove
    behind the outer entrance. Within was a door, opening inwards. The
    central part of the portal was boarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> over. The structure is good,
    very early Perpendicular, the work, no doubt, of an Earl of Lancaster.</p>

  <p>The upper or north gatehouse is framed of timber, and probably of Tudor
    date. It stands close north of the west end of the church, with which
    it was, until recently, connected by certain timber houses, used by the
    prebendaries. These have been pulled down.</p>

  <p>Parts of the church are Norman, and the north aisle seems of the date
    of the hall of the castle, and, therefore, a part of the work of Robert
    de Bellomont. There is a small door in the west wall of the aisle, that
    may very well have opened from the base court of the castle.</p>

  <p>In this court, in front of the hall, is a small knoll, in which were
    recently found two skeletons, headless, the head placed on the breast
    of each. This was, therefore, the place of execution in front of the
    hall of trial.</p>

  <p>Should the Courts of the county of Leicester ever be lodged in a
    more central or more convenient building, it is to be hoped that the
    castle hall will be divested of its unseemly additions, and restored
    to its original dimension and pattern, when, probably, some correct
    information would be discovered as to the vaults and foundations of the
    buildings of the eleventh century.</p>

  <p>Leicester Castle, mutilated as it is, is yet a very fine specimen of
    a Norman fortress on an earlier site. The latter represented by the
    mound, the former by the hall and chapel, form together a good example
    of the Norman practice of placing the castle proper on the level
    ground, and treating the mound as a part of the external defences.</p>

  <p>Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon Mr. William Napier Reeve, the
    deputy constable of the castle, for his care of the hall intrusted to
    his charge. The b√¢ton used on all solemn occasions by the Constable or
    by himself is part of one of the original Norman posts that supported
    the roof of the nave; and the post, from its great size, must certainly
    have been an old tree when the castle was built, and therefore have
    been in growth when the mound, the work of √Üthelfl√¶d, was thrown up.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="LEYBOURNE_CASTLE_KENT">LEYBOURNE CASTLE, KENT.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS castle, the lords of which played a considerable part in the
    earlier troubles of the thirteenth century, when two of the name were
    summoned as barons, stands by the road-side near its parish church of
    the same name, between Snodland and West Malling, in Kent, and at no
    great distance from the ancient Neville seat of Birling.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

  <p>The building, judging from its present remains, is scarcely in keeping
    with the wealth of its late lords, nor does it appear ever to have
    been more extensive. Part of the walls may be of Norman date, but the
    general aspect is of the date of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and the gateway may be of
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>The most perfect portion is the gateway, a pointed and ribbed arch,
    which opens between two bold drum towers, placed unusually close
    together. Above the portal is a slit or chase, about 3 feet wide and
    6 inches deep, pointing downwards and outwards, and much resembling a
    large post-office opening. The narrow dimensions of this opening, its
    straight sides, and thickness of the wall, would prevent its being used
    for the casting down of projectiles, and even as a horizontal loop its
    range would be very limited. It may possibly have been intended for the
    pouring down of water, supposing the outer gate to have been assailed
    by fire.</p>

  <p>A little in advance of this wall, on either side of the doorway, is a
    portcullis groove, rectangular instead of a half round as usual; and
    these grooves, instead of ascending as a chase or slit in the entrance
    vault, placing the grate when lifted nearly out of sight, ascend in
    front of the door to about double its height, so that the grating
    would always be entirely visible, whether down or up. The chains by
    which it hung, also visible, ascended through a machicolation at the
    rampart level, formed by throwing a flat segmental arch from tower to
    tower, parallel to and about 18 inches in advance of the gateway and
    wall above it. This arrangement, seen at Neath and elsewhere, enabled
    stones or heavy projectiles to be dropped with but little risk to those
    employing them.</p>

  <p>In advance of the portcullis grooves, two lateral holes at the level of
    the door-cill show where the pivots of the drawbridge rested. Bridge
    pit and moat are now filled up. The rear parts of the gatehouse and
    entrance vault have been destroyed.</p>

  <p>The irregular outline of the castle may be traced, and two detached
    groups of ruins, with a couple of drum towers, remain; but there is
    nothing of any special interest excepting the gateway and its defences.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="LINCOLN_CASTLE">LINCOLN CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WHEN ‚Äúthe devil looked over Lincoln‚Äù he is said to have smiled at
    man‚Äôs costly devotion. But if the smile of the arch-enemy of mankind
    was, as must be supposed, in derision of man‚Äôs attempts at progress,
    the occasion of it was singularly ill-chosen, for in the whole of
    Britain it would be difficult to find a tract for the well-being of
    which man has exerted himself so much and so successfully. Two thousand
    years ago, that broad but not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> unbroken plain which extends from the
    Wash to the Humber, from the Trent and the uplands of Nottingham and
    Derby to the German Ocean was composed of arid heath and moorish fen,
    contributing little to the material support of man, and probably
    nothing to his moral culture. Beasts of chase, fish, and water-fowl
    shared the territory with savage hordes, but little removed from the
    animals upon which they preyed. By slow degrees, by many generations of
    men, labouring through many centuries, great things have been achieved.
    The fen has been banked and drained, and the heath brought under
    culture, so that the whole expanse is now covered by green pastures and
    rich root crops, and year after year the autumnal sun is reflected from
    broad fields waving with golden grain.</p>

  <p>Nor has the moral been behind the material progress. From the castled
    hill of Belvoir, to the rocks of Newark and Nottingham, and the crowned
    promontory of Lincoln, the land bristles with the works of man. The
    constructive taste and skill of many generations, and their deep
    religious feeling, are represented by a rich variety of ecclesiastical
    architecture, from the rude and primitive tower of Barton to the lordly
    spires of Louth and Newark, and the glorious lanthorn of Boston;
    churches and schools, mansion-houses and granges, ‚Äútower and village,
    dome and farm,‚Äù are unmistakable evidences of peace, prosperity, and
    civilisation. There, too, are to be seen, not sparingly scattered, the
    sunken arch and ruined aisle, the ivy-covered remains and richly-carved
    fragments of many religious houses, making pleasant the study of hoar
    antiquity, and reminding us that there was a time when each was a
    centre of gospel truth, and of an early and beneficial civilisation,
    the abode of men who did good work in their day, and founded by those who‚Äî</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Something of all this is visible to mere mortal ken, and far more to
    him who adds to the material prospect a knowledge of the past and the
    distant. It is true that the vision thus beheld from the guarded mount
    of Lincoln is not equal to that far wider and more noble outlook from
    a more exalted pinnacle, upon the description of which Milton has
    poured forth in one glittering roll the full stream of his learning,
    illuminated by the fire of his genius, but it is nevertheless one in
    which the student of the past may well take delight.</p>

  <p>Lincoln itself is thickly strewed with the footsteps of the past.
    The Briton, the Roman, the Saxon, the Dane, the Englishman, and the
    Norman, have successively been lords of the soil, and each has left his
    mark, either in material traces or in a nomenclature still less liable
    to decay. A great historian, our chief authority also in matters of
    topography, has pronounced the earthworks to the north of the city to
    be of British origin. If this be so, they must be the work of those
    Romanised Britons who attempted, though in vain, to hold their country
    against the Picts and Scots, and the Scandinavian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> hordes from beyond
    the German Ocean, and who, while so striving, showed some considerable
    acquaintance with the Roman rules of castrametation, though unequal,
    it would seem, to the works in masonry for which that people were so
    celebrated. The conclusion that these earthworks are, if not Roman,
    early post-Roman British, rests upon the fact that their outline is
    rectangular, and that the enclosure is bisected, nearly equally, by the
    Roman way.</p>

  <p>Of the earlier Britons, those dispossessed by the Romans, the traces
    are slight indeed, and probably confined to a few nearly effaced
    intrenchments, and to the roots of such proper names as ‚ÄúDurnomagus,‚Äù
    ‚ÄúSegelocum,‚Äù ‚ÄúBanovallum,‚Äù on the Bane river, and ‚ÄúLindum,‚Äù names
    which probably, like ‚ÄúEboracum‚Äù and ‚ÄúLondinum,‚Äù represent an earlier
    appellation. The mound at Riseholme, if sepulchral, may, of course,
    be of any age; but the district, possessing but few of those grand
    features which are usually the earliest to receive their names and the
    latest to lose them, has retained no very obvious traces of its primal
    inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Of their successors, the remains are of a very different character.
    The imperial mistress of the world left everywhere traces of her
    sway not easily to be obliterated. Her measures of war were also
    calculated‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">pacis imponere morem</span>.‚Äù From the station at Lindum great
    roads radiated in several directions, and preserved that facility of
    communication which civilised conquerors usually seek to establish.</p>

  <p>In the modern city of Lincoln, the Roman Lindum is well represented.
    The Roman walls, 10 feet to 12 feet thick, and 20 feet to 25 feet high,
    included a nearly rectangular area, within which was the high ground
    of the upper city. Of this enclosure, the northern or upper end was
    cut off by a cross wall, and formed the military quarter, 385 yards
    north and south, by an average of 517 yards east and west. Of the
    four gates of the station, that to the north, upon the Ermine Street,
    still bears a name which must have descended from the time when it was
    first erected, and when it probably superseded an earlier structure,
    and is called the New-port. Of the opposite, or south gate, only one
    jamb remains. Of the east gate, the place is known, and a few of its
    very peculiar stones are built into the adjacent enclosures. The west
    gate was laid open a few years ago, but, as the arch gave way under
    the process, it was removed. Of the walls which connected these gates,
    some fragments remain. One lies west and another east of the north
    gate, and there is a considerable mass south of the north-east angle,
    capping which, the foundations of a round tower, of 9 feet interior
    diameter, have been discovered. There is also a fragment of wall in the
    slope of what is called the observatory mound, a little west of the
    remains of the south gate. The exterior ditch, also more or less Roman,
    is in parts very perfect, broad and deep along the north front, and,
    though narrower, deep and well preserved about the north-east angle.
    There is also, within the area, the side wall and part of the front of
    a considerable building, known, probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> from its medi√¶val use, as
    the Mint. The exterior Roman walls are laid upon the natural ground,
    although the earth is heaped up against their inner face as a ramp or
    terrace.</p>

  <p>The southern half of the Roman station is divided between the cathedral
    and the castle, the church, though the later occupant, taking the
    larger half. Some centuries, however, must have passed between the
    departure of the Romans and the throwing up of the earthworks of
    the castle, during which time the Roman walls were broken down, and
    their contained buildings laid waste, as is shown by the dilapidated
    condition of those remaining parts which have been found buried beneath
    the castle works.</p>

  <p>The English fortress is placed within the south-west quarter of the
    Roman station, and its outline, roughly four-sided, was no doubt
    governed by the lines of the two adjacent Roman walls. It stands on
    the crest of the steep slope, covered, as in Roman days, by the city,
    and descending about 200 feet to the river. It is contained within a
    massive earth-bank, from 50 yards to 80 yards broad, and from 20 feet
    to 30 feet in height, internally of easy slope, externally steep, and
    which, though in substance within the Roman area, extends its skirts
    beyond the line of the wall, so that the Roman west gate was found
    buried within its substance, and a fragment of the south wall is still
    seen to rise through its slope. This bank measures, upon its north
    face, 180 yards, upon its south face 170 yards, its east 134 yards,
    and its west 163 yards. Here, as at York, it is evident not only that
    these earthworks are of post-Roman date, but that the Roman walls were
    completely ruined before the earthworks were thrown up. The enclosure
    may contain from 6 acres to 7 acres. At the south-east angle the bank
    swells into, and ends in, a large conical mound, about 40 feet high,
    and 50 feet diameter at the top. Besides this, there is a second and
    larger mound, about 40 feet high, and 100 feet diameter at the top,
    which was the citadel or keep of the place, and the site of the hall
    of its English lord. This mound, though near the centre of the south
    front, was not a continuous part of the regular earth-bank, which it
    here replaced. It had its own proper circular ditch, communicating
    on the outside with, and forming a part of, the regular ditch of the
    place, as is yet evident, notwithstanding much filling up.</p>

  <p>It will thus be seen that Lincoln Castle, as regards its earthworks,
    belongs to that type of English fortress in which the mound has its
    proper ditch, and is placed on one side of an appended area, also with
    its bank and ditch. The general area, which at Windsor, Arundel, and
    Berkhampstead is oblong, to suit the contour of the ground, is here,
    as at Tonbridge, Tickhill, and Clare, where the ground is not strongly
    marked, nearer to a more solid figure, of which, in this case, two
    sides and the contained angle are governed by the line of the old Roman
    wall. In general, these fortresses are much alike, and all belong
    to that class of burhs known to have been thrown up by the English
    in the ninth and tenth centuries, and at about the same time by the
    Scandinavian settlers in Normandy. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>Two mounds, though not unknown,
    are uncommon. At Lewes there are two, one at each end of an oblong
    enclosure. At Hereford, besides the keep mound, now removed, there is
    a mass of earth at the north-east corner of the outer area, a part of
    the bank, and at Cardiff also, besides the keep mound, are two masses
    of earth upon the north-east and south-east corners of the enclosure,
    forming, which there the keep mound does not, a part of the bank. Such
    subordinate mounds are not uncommon in earthworks of all ages, and
    are totally distinct from the grand isolated moated mound which gives
    character to the earthworks of the ninth and tenth centuries, both in
    England and Normandy.</p>

  <p>When, in 1068, the Conqueror marched from York to Cambridge, he paused
    at Lincoln, even then a very important place, fenced in and populous,
    not indeed as yet boasting a minster, but numbering 1,150 inhabited
    houses, a leading member of the famous Danish civic confederation, and
    governed by twelve lawmen, who wielded powers elsewhere exercised by
    the territorial lords. As he traversed the intrenchment that covered
    the northern front, and entered the city through the strong Roman
    gateway, still in use, he could not but appreciate the strength and
    importance of the place, of which he seems to have been allowed to
    take peaceable possession. Here, as at York and Cambridge, he at once
    ordered the English stronghold to be converted into a Norman castle.
    What was the precise condition of the existing work, or what was
    immediately executed in obedience to William‚Äôs order, we do not know;
    there were, of course, defences, probably of timber, along the crest
    of the banks, and upon the summit of the mound, but whether William
    merely directed these to be strengthened, or had them replaced by walls
    such as were coming into use in Normandy, does not appear; probably
    the former: as time pressed, and there was much work of the same kind
    to execute all over England, it was important to secure an immediate
    shelter for the Norman garrison. That the 166 houses which, we learn
    from Domesday, were destroyed to make way for Lincoln Castle were not
    removed to allow of the extension of its area is certain, for the
    Norman walls stand upon the English banks. It is probable that, during
    the long and prosperous reign of the Confessor, houses had been allowed
    to be built upon the slopes and glacis of the ditch, and, perhaps,
    actually within the fortress. This, of course, could not be tolerated,
    and is probably the removal recorded. But, if timber was employed, it
    was, of course, only until works in masonry could be erected, and,
    whatever the Conqueror‚Äôs officers may have actually executed, there can
    be little doubt but that they or their immediate successors designed
    the gates, walls, and keep of the castles, as these now stand.</p>

  <p>The castle is placed in the south-west quarter of the Roman station,
    high above the city and the valley of the Witham, which lie to its
    south and east, and somewhat elevated, artificially, above the table
    land to its north and west. Its walled <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> lies just
    within the Roman area, to the adjacent limits of which its southern
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> western fronts are roughly parallel. The curtain wall, a very
    remarkable, and, on the whole, a very perfect work, is built upon the
    ridge or central line of the earth-bank, and therefore contains the
    same space, and is in circuit about 650 yards; it is from 8 feet to 10
    feet thick, and 30 feet to 35 feet or even 40 feet high, exhibiting
    much herring-bone work, and certainly of Norman, and possibly early
    Norman, date. Opposite to the great mound, where the earth-banks
    cease, the wall is continued across the ditch and up the slope of the
    mound, as at Tamworth and Tonbridge. To enable it to reach the level
    of the battlements of the keep, it is raised by steps to the point of
    junction, and there contains chambers which will be more conveniently
    described with the keep.</p>

  <p>In the wall are two principal gates, one to the east, opening into the
    upper city, opposite to the Exchequer Gate of the Close, and the other
    to the west, opening direct into the field. Besides these there is a
    small door opening towards the south upon the lower city, and a door in
    the keep in the same direction.</p>

  <p>The main entrance is placed in the east wall at about 40 yards from
    its south-east angle. The west gate stands in the west wall, about 30
    yards from the north-west angle, which length is thrown back at a very
    obtuse angle, probably to avoid the remains of the Roman west gate,
    which stood about four yards in front of it. Both east and west gates
    are of Norman date, and were originally much alike, each being a plain
    arch, placed in a rectangular bay or recess in the wall, 18 feet wide
    by 10 feet deep, instead of, as was more usual, in a regular square
    gatehouse, as at Tickhill, Porchester, and Sherborne. The bay may have
    been closed in the rear by a cross-wall with a second archway, of which
    there is an indication at the west gate. There was an upper chamber
    with a timber floor. At the east gate the arch is full centred, of
    14 feet opening, without chamfer or rebate, or ornament of any kind.
    Probably there is a portcullis groove, but if so it is blocked up
    and completely concealed by the woodwork of the modern doors. It is
    certain that the main entrance of a Norman castle could never have been
    so constructed that there should be no rebate against which the door
    should be pressed when closed, and probably the fitting was composed
    of a ring of stones inserted, as in the doorway in the cross-wall of
    Rochester keep, without bond, into the exterior arch. Over the door
    is a pointed window, probably an early English or early Decorated
    insertion. Later in the Decorated period, this gateway has been masked
    by a front containing a bold equilateral arch, springing from two
    angular corbels, behind which the Norman doorway is seen. Above, the
    two outer angles are capped by two round turrets, corbelled out of the
    angle and rising about 6 feet, and between them the curtain projects at
    a low angle, the salient being over the entrance. The arrangement is
    unusual, but the effect is good. It is said that the turrets contained
    staircases, ascending from the upper floor to the battlements, but they
    are not now accessible. There were lateral walls projecting forward
    from each side of the entrance. Across the ditch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> and between them,
    was the drawbridge, traces of the recesses for working which still
    remain. The entrance was flanked by two stone lions, of one of which
    a fragment is preserved in the castle; the interior additions to this
    gate are entirely modern.</p>

  <p>The west gate, of the same age and pattern, has fortunately been
    long walled up, and so has escaped alteration. Here the portcullis
    groove is exposed to view, and there is a rebate for the door, though
    concealed by the cross-wall. Here also is what looks like the springing
    of an arch across the inner face of the bay, though Norman mural
    towers were sometimes, as at Ludlow, left open, to be closed only
    with brattice-work. The upper floor has two small Norman windows in
    front, and a small door, flat headed, but with a round-headed arch
    of relief; this opened upon the battlements of the barbican. Of this
    barbican, which was composed of two flanking walls and an outer gate,
    the north wall remains and part of the south. The wall rises to the
    level of the upper floor of the gatehouse, projects about 30 feet, and
    is 7 feet thick. The masonry is evidently of the date of the gateway,
    and contains some herring-bone work. The approach must have been very
    steep, the sill of the gate being some feet above the level of the
    counterscarp.</p>

  <p>Another work of Norman date is a rectangular tower, about 25 feet by
    40 feet, placed upon the summit of the south-eastern mound; it is of
    two floors, vaulted, and chiefly built in ashlar; it contains a good
    straight mural staircase. To the Norman work has been added, in the
    Decorated period, a front, upon the east face, also of two floors,
    flanked by two square turrets, bringing up the whole tower to a
    square of 40 feet. The peculiarity of this tower is that, instead of
    flanking the curtain, it is set back a little from its line. A modern
    <i lang="fr">gazebo</i> has been added above, and the whole is dignified by the
    name of the Observatory.</p>

  <p>In the curtain, at the foot of the observatory mount, and between it
    and the keep, is a pointed arch of relief, and below it, beneath a rude
    flat lintel, composed of two large stones, is a small door, either
    never opened, or closed at a very early period. This arch is certainly
    late Norman, and seems of the same date with that part of the curtain
    in which it is imbedded.</p>

  <p>The Keep, also Norman, is an unusually perfect example of a shell keep.
    It is in plan a somewhat irregular polygon, 64 feet north and south by
    74 feet east and west within the walls, which are about 8 feet thick.
    Within, it has twelve sides, of irregular lengths. Without are fifteen,
    and each angle is capped with a broad flat pilaster, all rising from a
    common plinth. At about two-thirds of the height there is a set-off,
    common to wall and pilaster; the latter has also a bold roll moulding.
    The wall is 20 feet high to the rampart walk. The parapet is gone.
    The keep stands upon the line of the curtain, which abuts upon it at
    opposite sides; so dividing it that there are eight facets outside the
    wall, and seven inside. The main entrance is by a full-centred arch
    of 7 feet opening, set in a broad, projecting buttress or pilaster
    towards the north-east. The arch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> the actual doorway and of its
    inner recess is segmental. There was no portcullis, and the door had
    a stout wooden bar. Above the outer arch is a hood-moulding, with a
    light Norman ornament, said to be a restoration from the original. At
    present a straight steep flight of steps leads up to the door, and
    these, though modern, probably represent the original mode of approach.
    There is another and smaller door, diagonally opposite to the main
    door, to the south-west; this is quite plain, the arches segmental, the
    outer boldly splayed. The opening is 5 feet 6 inches wide. There are
    traces of something like a third door in the eastern face outside the
    curtain, opening from a bay in the wall. Opposite to this, in the west
    wall, is another bay, also 12 feet wide, but no trace of an opening.
    There are no loops in the wall of the keep, no trace of any buildings
    within its area, nor have any foundations been discovered there. It
    is pretty clear that any accommodation provided there was by means of
    timber structures placed against the wall, leaving an open court in
    the centre. There are indications, on the masonry, of an upper floor.
    Where the two curtains join the keep, each contains, at its rampart
    level, a mural chamber, about 6 feet wide by 12 feet long, the floor of
    which is about 10 feet or 12 feet from the ground. These chambers are
    choked with brambles and not accessible, but they have no door towards
    the ramparts of the curtain, and seem to have been entered from the
    upper part of the keep; that to the west is a garderobe, and has a loop
    and shoot upon the north or inner face; the other has a loop only, and
    that outwards: one of them is said to have been groined and vaulted,
    the vaults springing from columns in the angles. This is probably that
    towards the east, and it may have been an oratory, as at Arundel.</p>

  <p>The above works, curtain, gateways, observatory tower, and keep contain
    the only Norman masonry now extant. The curtain, for its great length,
    is singularly deficient in flanking towers. At the south-west angle the
    wall has been laid open by a wide breach, and built up, and there may
    have been a tower, but it is more probable that here was the junction
    with the city wall.</p>

  <p>Generally, the lower two-thirds of the curtain look much older than the
    upper part, and the line of junction is very uneven, as though the wall
    had long been left in a ruinous condition. This may have been so; but,
    as there is no diminution in the excessive thickness, it seems more
    probable that the new work is confined to the facing. No doubt when the
    castle was taken by the county much was done to the walls; but they
    could scarcely, at that time, have been much lower than they are now,
    for to rebuild them at their present thickness would have been a great
    and quite unnecessary expense.</p>

  <p>The herring-bone work is of a superficial character, confined to the
    facing; not, as in the Roman work, carried through the substance of the
    wall. Mr. Wilson, in his paper on this castle, states that, when the
    foundations of the curtain were laid open during some repairs, they
    were found to be worked in with a sort of framework of timber, tieing
    the whole together. Such a precaution was often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> taken by the Norman
    builders, even to the extent of enclosing ties in the superstructure,
    especially where the work was laid upon made ground. The cavities left
    by the decay of such ties are seen at Rochester and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>There is a flanking tower capping the north-east angle of the place, an
    insertion, though whether replacing a Norman structure is not known. It
    is called ‚ÄúCobbe Hall,‚Äù and is in plan very slightly horseshoe, with
    prolonged sides and a square rear. It is in breadth 25 feet, and in
    length 40 feet. It has a basement and first floor, both covered in with
    acutely-pointed vaulting, with deeply-splayed loops towards the field.
    The basement is reached by a trap-door and ladder, and the upper floor
    and battlements by a stone stair. It seems, from the rings let into
    the wall, to have been a prison. It has been called a chapel, probably
    because its round or apsidal end looks towards the north-east.</p>

  <p>There is a deep well in the north side of the great enclosure, still in
    use, and the bottom of which has recently been enlarged into a cistern.
    The castle stands upon the oolite rock, and is mainly built of that
    material, laid as roughly-coursed rubble, but the keep, the observatory
    tower, and the Decorated work are mostly of ashlar.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to form a decided opinion as to the age of the several
    works in masonry remaining in this castle. The two gateways and much of
    the curtain, especially its north and west sides, are probably early
    Norman. The keep and observatory tower are later in the same style.
    To judge from the little postern, the curtain between the observatory
    mount and the keep, and probably the part beyond it, are also late
    Norman; that is to say, the English defences of the keep were the
    last to be replaced, and it was a century before the isolation of its
    mound was broken by the carrying the curtain across its ditches, and
    the completion of its general <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. Altogether it seems
    probable that the lower stage of the two gateways, and the older part
    of the curtain, were constructed during the reign of the Conqueror, or,
    at any rate, before the close of the eleventh century. The keep and
    observatory tower were probably built, the upper floor of the gateways
    added, and the curtain raised and completed, in the reign of Stephen,
    who granted, with the castle and city of Lincoln, to Gernons, Earl
    of Chester, licence to fortify a tower in the castle, and to hold it
    until he recovered his own castle of Tickhill,‚Äîand even then, when he
    surrendered Lincoln, he was to retain his own tower, which his mother,
    Countess Lucia, had fortified, in the castle, of which also he was to
    retain the hereditary constableship. As the keep was the only part of
    the castle which could be held independently of the rest, it must be to
    it that the charter relates. It is curious that Tickhill should also
    have a mound and polygonal keep.</p>

  <p>As to the later works, Cobbe Hall, and the additions to the observatory
    tower and the eastern gateway, are probably the work of Thomas of
    Lancaster, Earl of Lincoln, who held the castle from 1312 to 1322.
    The Pipe Roll of 2 John, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1200, records a charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> of ¬£20
    by the constable of Lincoln Castle for the repairs of the new tower,
    probably the keep.</p>

  <p>The additions directed by the Conqueror to the defences of the hill,
    already strong by nature and by art, rendered Lincoln, under the
    Norman dynasty, even a more important city than it had been under the
    earlier governments. Its castle was the almost impregnable fortress,
    held by or for the sovereign, of a very important division of England;
    but it was a division strong in its rivers and marshy ground, in its
    English and thoroughly disaffected feeling, and open to the visits of
    the Danes, no longer as enemies, but as allies to the cause of the
    people. Its position, dominating the whole shire, challenged comparison
    with Belvoir, which received a similar accession of strength, and
    Nottingham, on the brow of which a rectangular keep of the first
    class was then in progress; but what confirmed its central authority,
    and placed it far above any castled eminence of the counties of the
    Midland, was the recognition of the hill as the centre of an important
    bishopric, and the foundation by Remigius of the stately pile to which
    many succeeding centuries have added beauty and grandeur.</p>

  <p>The castle long remained a part of the demesne of the Crown but was
    administered by constables, whose office was, at times, regarded as
    hereditary, and, on one very important occasion, was held by a lady.
    Always a strong position, it became especially valuable upon the death
    of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, when the long civil war broke out between his daughter and
    his nephew, and, by one party or the other, all existing castles were
    strengthened and an immense number of new ones built. In such a state
    of anarchy a castle became a necessary of life, and the bishops vied
    with, and even surpassed, the lay barons in their examples of military
    architecture. Sherborne, Malmesbury, and the strong and magnificent
    Devizes were the work of Bishop Roger of Salisbury, as were Newark and
    Sleaford of his nephew, Alexander of Lincoln; and the castle of Ely, of
    Giles, another nephew, and prelate of that see. Durham, also, was held
    by its bishop, and the Close of Lichfield strongly intrenched.</p>

  <p>Of the lay adherents of Matilda, Robert Earl of Gloucester, her wise
    and faithful brother, built the castles of Cardiff, Bristol, and
    Gloucester; Fitz-Alan held Shrewsbury; D‚ÄôAlbini, Arundel; Talbot,
    Hereford; Paganel, Ludlow; Brian Fitz-Count, Wallingford; D‚ÄôOyley,
    Oxford; Robert of Lincoln, Wareham; Mohun, Dunster; Lovel, Castle Cary;
    Mandeville, Walden and Plessis; and Fitz-John, Melton. Dover, much
    strengthened by Maminot, was surrendered to the queen. It is curious
    that, of all these castles, six only, Sherborne, Bristol, Ludlow,
    Walden, and Dover, with Hedingham, held by De Vere for Stephen, are
    certainly known to have had square keeps; of the others, seven are
    doubtful, but thirteen had shell keeps upon mounds.</p>

  <p>Among those who at first adhered to the cause of Stephen were the two
    half-brothers, William de Roumare and Ranulph, Earl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> Chester, who
    had hereditary claims upon a large Lincolnshire property, and, of some
    sort, upon the castle of Lincoln. These, as regarded the castle, were
    exercised mainly by the Earl of Chester, the younger, but, in England
    at least, the most powerful of the two.</p>

  <p>Their claims dated from a period before the Conquest, and were no
    doubt connected with the ownership of the English fortress. √Ülfgar,
    Earl of Mercia, son of Earl Leofric, and lord of many Lincolnshire
    lordships, was father of the well-known Earls Eadwine and Morkere,
    and of Ealdgyth, widow of Gryffydd of Wales, and afterwards of
    Harold, and of Lucia, or Lucy, the eventual heiress of the family,
    and as such claiming not only the Lincolnshire lands, but, as it
    seems, the hereditary constableship of the castle. Mr. Nichols, in a
    very valuable paper upon the earls of Lincoln, has shown that Lucy
    married Ivo Taillebois, one of the Conqueror‚Äôs barons, a hero both
    of history and romance, and, in right of his wife, a great landowner
    in Lincolnshire. Her name occurs in his charter in 1085 concerning
    the church of Spalding. Ivo died in 1114, and their daughter, another
    Lucy, an heiress or co-heiress, and who claimed the constableship of
    Lincoln Castle, and fortified one of its towers, married, first, Roger
    de Roumare, and second, Ranulph de Briquesard, called Le Meschines,
    Earl of Chester, who died 1129. By each she had a son. (1) William
    de Roumare, afterwards Earl of Lincoln; and (2) Ranulph, called
    Gernons, Earl of Chester. These two half-brothers, unstable and greedy
    politicians and soldiers, played considerable parts in the war of the
    succession, and had much to say to Lincoln Castle.</p>

  <p>Early in the struggle in 1140, Stephen acknowledged the claim of
    De Roumare, and created him one of his earls, called in derision
    ‚Äúpseudo-comites,‚Äù because they had not the usual third penny from a
    county. Notwithstanding this favour, however, the brothers, a few days
    or weeks afterwards took the castle of Lincoln by surprise, turned out
    the royal soldiers, and held it for Matilda. Stephen, highly incensed,
    marched at once to Lincoln, and, supported by the citizens, laid siege
    to the castle from the west front, that next the city, but on which the
    ground was less steep than within the city itself. Earl Ranulph, on
    this, escaped from the place, leaving it, with his wife and children,
    in charge of De Roumare, while he went to persuade his brother-in-law,
    Robert, Earl of Gloucester, to come to their rescue. Robert accordingly
    led a force of 10,000 men in that direction, and the two earls, fording
    or swimming the Trent and the marsh lands on its margin, were met by
    the king in person. The result was the Battle or ‚ÄúJoust of Lincoln,‚Äù
    fought on the 2nd of February, 1141, in which Stephen was taken, to
    be exchanged a short time afterwards for Earl Robert. Mr. Nichols has
    pointed out that a certain Gilbert de Gant, a young Lincolnshire noble,
    being taken in the battle, was married by the Earl of Chester to his
    niece Rohesia, and was also created Earl of Lincoln, which title he
    retained till his death, in 1156. Mr. Nichols suggests that Rohesia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
    was probably a sister‚Äôs daughter, and a co-heiress of Lucy Taillebois
    the first, and therefore a co-heir of Earl √Ülfgar.</p>

  <p>William de Roumare left a son, who died before him, and the grandson,
    though holding a large Lincolnshire estate, and in rank an earl, never
    assumed the title of Lincoln. He died childless, 1198, and the title of
    Lincoln seems to have been dropped for a time, Alice, Earl Gilbert‚Äôs
    daughter and heiress, being styled only ‚ÄúCountess Alice, daughter of
    Earl Gilbert.‚Äù</p>

  <p>In 1144 also, at Christmas, Earl Ranulph was a second time besieged
    in Lincoln Castle by King Stephen, and also without success; but two
    years later, he, being at the king‚Äôs court, was made prisoner, and had
    to give up the castle as his ransom. Once fairly in possession of it,
    Stephen caused himself to be crowned at Lincoln.</p>

  <p>In 1147 their positions were reversed, and the city was attacked by
    the earl, but without success; and in 1151 he became a second time
    Stephen‚Äôs prisoner, and so continued a few months, until, at the
    pacification of Wallingford, in 1151, he was set free, included in the
    general amnesty, and received from Stephen the grant of the city and
    castle already noticed, to be held until Tickhill should be restored to him.</p>

  <p>During the reign of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> the Crown recovered much of its power,
    and Lincoln Castle seems to have been dissociated from the earldom,
    although the Earl of Chester preserved a hold upon it. Richard de Hay
    held the constableship in fee, and it descended to his daughter and
    heiress, Nicholaa, who married Gerald de Camville, who received from
    Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the custody of the castle and the farm of the revenues of
    the county. Gerald, however, was a partisan of Prince John, and stood a
    siege in the castle from Longchamp, chancellor to the absent Richard.
    The castle was relieved by John; but Gerard lost his office and farm in
    1194, until John became king. His widow, Nicholaa, held the castle for
    the king against the insurgent lords. After the war, King John visited
    Lincoln, and Nicholaa, then of great age, received him at the east
    gate of the castle, and offered him the keys, desiring to be relieved
    on account of her age. John gracefully requested her to retain the
    keys, and she continued in command through the reign of John, and into
    that of Henry his son. Nicholaa was sheriff of the county, and a very
    remarkable person. In her latter days she had an assistant assigned
    to her, and a manor to support the charges of her office. She finally
    retired, and died in 1231.</p>

  <p>In 1216, towards the close of John‚Äôs reign, Gilbert de Gant, nephew to
    the former Earl of Lincoln of the same name, condescended to accept
    the titular rank at the hands of the invading French Prince Louis, and
    took the city, but not the castle. He fought and was taken at the ‚ÄúFair
    of Lincoln,‚Äù in May, 1217, by Ranulph de Blondville, Earl of Chester,
    a man of small stature but a great soldier, who added the title of
    Lincoln to that of Chester four days after the battle, and held it
    until he resigned it to his sister, Hawise de Quincy, in 1232. The
    actual relief introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> into the castle before the battle was led by
    the notorious Fulk de Breaut√©.</p>

  <p>The descent of the constableship of the castle is at this point rather
    obscure. It seems, probably during the minority of De Camville‚Äôs
    daughter and heiress, Idonea, to have been administered successively
    by Philip de Lascelles, Walter Evermue, and, in 1224, by William de
    Longesp√©e, Earl of Salisbury, probably as having married Idonea,
    daughter and heiress of Gerard de Camville. Whether their son William,
    who died 1257, held it is uncertain, but whatever rights he had were
    united to those of the Earls of Lincoln by the marriage of his daughter
    and heiress, Margaret Longesp√©e, to Henry de Lacy. Henry was descended
    from Hawise de Quincy, whose daughter Margaret carried the earldom to
    her husband John de Lacy, who died 1240. Their son, Edmond, did not
    live to inherit; but his son, Henry de Lacy, was Earl of Lincoln, and
    by his marriage with Margaret Longesp√©e, earl also of Salisbury. In the
    Escheat Roll, 4 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, he is entered as constable of the castle of Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Alice, the daughter and heiress of Henry de Lacy, married Thomas,
    Earl of Lancaster, and, in her right, of Lincoln, grandson of Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and thus both the constableship and the fee of the castle became
    absorbed in the Duchy of Lancaster, and so in the Crown. During the
    wars of Charles and the Parliament, the castle was held as a military
    post for the king. In 1644 it fell, with the city, into the hands of
    the Parliament, and finally, in 1832, was sold to the county.</p>

  <p>The Pipe and Close Rolls contain many entries in the reigns of Henry
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, John, and Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, relating to the castle,
    sometimes for repairs, sometimes for manacles for prisoners, sometimes
    for sustentation of soldiers. There are orders for storing corn, for
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">balist√¶ ad strumum</span>‚Äù and ‚Äú<span lang="la">ad turnum</span>,‚Äù the former worked by hand, the
    latter by a winch. In 1225, we read of repairs to the gate of the
    castle, to the ‚ÄúTour de Luce,‚Äù and to the barbican. Even in Domesday,
    we have Waldin, ingeniator; Heppo, balistarius; and Ody, arbalistarius.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ABOUT two miles east of Cowbridge, and half a mile or so north of the
    old Roman way from that town to Cardiff, a brooklet from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary
    Down crosses the road, and descends a deep and narrow ravine, to fall
    into the broad Aberthin valley, about two miles above its junction
    with the Cowbridge Taw, near the village of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> Aberthin. The ground on
    either bank of the ravine is very strong, and has been occupied for
    the purposes of defence from an early period. On the right bank is a
    large and irregular, and, therefore, probably British, enclosure or
    encampment; the defences of which, on the upper or eastern side, are
    two banks, each with an exterior ditch; and on the lower, or northern
    and western sides, a single bank, the ground below being sufficiently
    steep to render a ditch impracticable and unnecessary. This camp is
    locally known as <em>Erw Gron</em>, or the round acre (unless otherwise
    described, the acre would probably be a rectangular slip).</p>

  <p>On the left or western bank, nearly opposite to the camp, is a rocky
    knoll, a little raised above the ground immediately adjacent to the
    west and south, but which towards the east and north slopes rapidly
    towards the brook and the Aberthin valley, perhaps a hundred feet
    below. Beyond the depression on the west and south, the ground expands
    into a platform of moderately level but broken ground, beyond which
    again is a considerable rise. Thus the knoll is both secluded from
    observation, and naturally strong, at least on the northern and eastern
    sides, and very defensible on the others. The approach was from the
    south-west, from the Cowbridge road, in which direction are buildings
    and remains of buildings, part modern, but part evidently having
    belonged to the outworks and outbuildings of the Tower.</p>

  <p>The Tower, or castle proper, was a shell of masonry, circular, or
    nearly so, about 64 feet diameter, placed upon and covering the top of
    the knoll, the sides of which were scarped down to a dry ditch about 30
    feet diameter, and now about 8 feet deep. Of this shell the outline of
    the whole foundation is to be traced, and towards the north-west are
    fragments of the wall and of ruined chambers; and to the north-east a
    small, low mound probably conceals the foundations of a mural tower.</p>

  <p>There are the ruins of a rectangular building about 28 feet square,
    with walls about 4 feet thick, parts of which retain their original
    facing of coursed limestone (apparently lias) roughly dressed with the
    hammer. The walls are about 10 feet to 12 feet high, and one forms a
    part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. These fragments may probably be parts of
    a small gatehouse, covering a narrow doorway, which would be all that
    could be needed for so small an enclosure. The masonry is evidently
    original; and the tower, probably, is of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    which seems to have been the date of a somewhat similar but superior
    structure at Whitchurch. Llanquian then belonged to the powerful
    family of Nerber of Castleton in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Athan‚Äôs, under whom it was
    probably held by the family of De Wintonia or De Wincestria, afterwards
    Wilkins, still extant, whose occupancy is preserved in the mead below,
    designated in the Ordnance Map as ‚ÄúPant Wilkin.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Across the site of both tower and camp are written in black letter,
    on the same map, the words <span class="antiqua">Twr Gron</span>, which appears to be a new
    name, compounded of those of the two very distinct remains. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> also
    singular that, in a map usually so very correct, the name of Llanquian
    does not appear.</p>

  <p>About half a mile south-east of the Tower, a part of the Cowbridge road
    is still known as ‚ÄúPant y lladron,‚Äù that is, <i lang="la">via latronum</i>, or
    the robbers‚Äô way: a name indicative of the former bad character of the
    spot, and suggesting a suspicion that the inhabitants of the strong
    place either connived at the robberies or perpetrated them themselves.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH Britain presents numerous examples of military works, and
    her Welsh and Scottish borders are very thickly set with castles, the
    circumstances of the country have not been favourable to the production
    of military buildings of the first class. Our insular position has
    enabled us to dispense altogether with grand frontier fortresses; and
    our great nobles, although they often held their own against the Crown,
    and even encroached upon its legitimate powers, drew their resources
    from estates more or less scattered in position, and seldom possessed
    whole provinces, or ruled over a territory sufficiently compact and
    extensive to justify the construction of a great castle-palace like
    those of France, for the defence of the lordship and the residence of
    the baron. The keeps of Arques, Etampes, Provins, and Vez; the towers
    of Coucy and Beaucaire; the walls of Avignon; and the fortresses of
    Ch√¢teau-Gaillard, Carcassonne, Villeneuve-les-Avignon, and Pierrefonds,
    the details of which are familiar to the readers of the exhaustive work
    of M. Viollet-le-Duc, are due to a period when France was divided into
    provinces, the rulers of which were scarcely subordinate to its Crown,
    and were either actual monarchs elsewhere, or held much of the state
    privilege and power of independent sovereigns.</p>

  <p>It happens, however, that, in that particular class of fortress of
    which the quadrangular Norman keep is the type, we have less to fear
    comparison, seeing that castles of this description are confined, or
    very nearly so, to our own country and to Normandy. Whereas, on the
    continent of Europe, in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, the earlier
    castles appear to have sprung directly from Roman, or debased Roman
    patterns, in Normandy a simpler and more original type prevailed,
    unlike what is seen in other parts of France, and which there is some
    reason to regard as the invention of the Normans themselves. These
    keeps, so remarkable for their simple quadrangular form and the immense
    solidity of their masonry, were erected in Normandy during the eleventh
    century, and are well known by such examples as Arques near Dieppe,
    Falaise, and Caen. By the Normans they were introduced into England.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

  <p>An unaltered Norman castle is very rare, if indeed such exists at all.
    It is, however, certain that the keep had an <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> defence
    and ditch, the latter sometimes part of an earlier earthwork; and
    in the base court thus formed were stabling and barracks, and other
    subordinate accommodations. These buildings were at first often of
    timber, and the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> a stout palisade, the object having
    been to afford protection to the garrison as rapidly as possible.
    Both at Dover and Windsor the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall, part of which is
    of late Norman date, stands upon the scarp of the ditch of an earlier
    earthwork, the solid chalk of which, as at Arques, is traversed by
    subterranean galleries. Where, as at Cardiff and the Tower, the wall
    is of great strength, and of the twelfth century, it is probable that
    the palisade was retained longer than usual, and the wall now seen the
    first constructed. No regular Norman wall would so soon have required
    reconstruction.</p>

  <p>Where the Norman wall was of light construction or insufficient area,
    it had to be removed, and in the larger works replaced by a double
    and concentric ring of defences. These additions, usually due to the
    reigns of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> and Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, show that military engineering had
    made great progress, and that less dependence was placed upon passive
    strength, and more upon the skilful distribution of material. Having
    regard to the state of the military art at that period, and to the
    cross and long bows, catapults, rams, scorpions, and movable turrets
    that formed the weapons of attack, it would be difficult to improve
    upon these concentric works, either in general design or in detail
    of construction, or to show greater skill in flanking defences than
    appears at Corfe, Caerphilly, Conway, or Beaumaris, or in other of
    the castles built in the reigns of Henry and his son. This science,
    so successfully grafted upon the pure Norman works, was no doubt in
    some considerable measure derived from the East, where C≈ìur de Lion
    seems to have acquired the skill displayed in the construction of
    Ch√¢teau-Gaillard, and which, in the opinion of M. Le Duc, places him at
    the head of the military engineers of his day.</p>

  <p>When, having crossed the Thames, the Conqueror marched in person to
    complete the investment of London, he found that ancient city resting
    upon the left bank of its river, protected on its landward side by a
    strong wall, a Roman work, with mural towers and an exterior ditch.</p>

  <p>The enclosure, of about 370 acres, was in general figure a semicircle;
    the river forming the chord. The defences, commencing on the Thames at
    Blackfriars, upon the east bank of the Flete, swept in an irregular
    curve northward and eastward, by Ludgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, and
    the line of London Wall to where, trending eastward and southward,
    they took the line of Houndsditch, and appear to have abutted upon the
    Thames a little east of or below Billingsgate. Upon the west the Flete
    formed a respectable natural defence, and upon the east the line took
    the crest of the high ground just where it begins to subside into the
    low lands long occupied by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs Hospital, and now, more
    suitably, by the docks of that name. Towards the north the defence must
    have been wholly artificial, and is reputed to have been by a ditch
    which, in the later reign of King John, was deepened and made 204 feet
    broad, but which must have been a sufficient defence even at the time
    of the Conqueror. Ludgate, like the later Newgate, was placed in a
    re-entering angle of the wall, so that the road approaching it from
    the west ran for a short distance parallel to, and commanded by the
    ramparts.</p>

  <p>London, therefore,‚Äî</p>

  <p class="noindent">resembled in plan and mode of entrance those large half-round Celtic
    earthworks sometimes found upon the banks of a watercourse; nor is
    there known to have been attached to or within it anything of the
    character of pr√¶torium or citadel.</p>

  <p>It is related that before the Conqueror entered London he directed a
    fortress to be built which should command the city. This, of course,
    was a temporary camp, and it was probably while he was at Westminster,
    or in the camp at Barking, that he studied the ground and selected as
    the site of his future citadel a point upon the eastern flank of the
    city defences, displacing for that purpose, we are told, a part of
    the Roman wall, including the two towers next to the Thames. Recent
    excavations have actually laid bare part of this wall a very few yards
    east of William‚Äôs tower.</p>

  <p>William was crowned in 1066, and it was from Barking, immediately after
    the ceremony, that he directed the actual commencement of the works,
    which were no doubt at first a deep ditch and strong palisade; for the
    keep, probably the earliest work in masonry, appears not to have been
    begun till twelve or fourteen years later.</p>

  <p>The new castle thus more than supplied the place of the removed works,
    for it could not only protect, but overawe the city, and, if necessary,
    cut off its trade and supplies by water.</p>

  <p>Such was the origin of this grand old fortress, the chief and central
    part of which gives mass and character to the group, and has from its
    earliest times caused the whole to pass under the name of ‚ÄúThe Tower.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The new fortress was supported by two other considerable works within
    the city, Baynard‚Äôs Castle upon the Thames‚Äô strand, built about
    the same time by Baynard, the castellan and standard-bearer of the
    city, and Montfitchet‚Äôs Castle, near it, built by a knight of that
    name. Later kings had ‚ÄúTower Royal,‚Äù in Vintry Ward, where Stephen
    lodged, and to which the mother of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> fled from the Tower
    in Wat Tyler‚Äôs rebellion. Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> also built a strong place near
    Blackfriars.</p>

  <p>The Tower, though all save the keep is later, and most of it
    considerably later than the eleventh century, well supplements the
    original design. The area enclosed and the strength of the walls and
    gates are in keeping with the dimensions and impregnable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>character
    of the keep; and the circumscribing ditch, though unusually broad and
    deep, was by no means too secure a defence against a turbulent and
    notoriously brave body of citizens.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Tower, in its present form, is a fine example of a concentric
    castle, of mixed composition, but general harmony of design, and
    covering, with its circumscribing ditch, about twelve acres of ground.</p>

  <p>Nearly in the centre, but now detached and alone, stands the keep, ‚Äú<span lang="fr">La
    blanche Tour</span>‚Äù of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the oldest and most stable part of the
    fortress. Around it is the inner ward, in plan generally four-sided,
    but with a salient on the north front, and contained within a wall
    strengthened by a gatehouse and twelve mural towers.</p>

  <p>Encircling this is the outer ward, following the same general plan,
    and contained within a wall rising from, and forming the scarp of,
    the ditch. Upon it are bold drum bastions, at the angles of the north
    front; and the south, or Thames front, is protected by five mural
    towers, of which one covers the land and one the water gate, and two
    others are connected with posterns.</p>

  <p>The ditch, which completely girdles the fortress, is divided from the
    river by a narrow strip of land used as a wharf, but also ingeniously
    contrived to cut off the water of the ditch from the tidal stream.</p>

  <p>The space outside the ditch, forming the esplanade of the fortress,
    is known as Tower Hill. It was once divided by the City wall, which
    extended from the north to the edge of the ditch, having a postern at
    the junction, which still gives name to a row of houses, and to the
    east of which is Little Tower Hill. The ground covered by the Tower
    rises from the river, so that parts of the inner ward are 40 feet above
    the water, and the ground north of, and outside the ditch, is 8 feet
    to 10 feet higher. This disadvantage was neutralised by the breadth of
    the ditch, while the descent towards the south, or entrance side, was
    of material advantage in repelling an attack from that side. The object
    being to command the river and fill the ditch, the keep was placed as
    high as was consistent with these points.</p>

  <p>It has been remarked by Sir F. Palgrave, that William, in settling the
    jurisdiction of his new fortress, respected, as far as possible, the
    limits of the City of London. Only the smaller half of the enclosure
    was within the line of the old wall; and, while the Tower liberties (if
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs be included within them) extend some distance eastward,
    or into the county of Middlesex, on the west frontier, the authority of
    the constable ranges but a little way beyond the counterscarp of the
    ditch. The area of the liberties proper is about 26 acres, of which the
    western portion stands in Tower Ward and All-Hallows Barking parish,
    and the eastern portion in the county of Middlesex.</p>

  <h3>DETAILED DESCRIPTION.</h3>

  <p>The <em>White</em>, or <em>C√¶sar‚Äôs Tower</em>, is the keep of the fortress.
    It stands a little to the south-east of the centre of the inner ward,
    upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> ground which, on the north, is 40 feet, and on the south 15
    feet above the ordnance mean water-mark, so that the basement is
    at the ground level on one side, and above it on the other. It is
    quadrangular, 107 feet north and south by 118 feet east and west. Its
    two western angles are square. That on the north-east is capped by a
    round stair-turret, 22 feet diameter, about one-third engaged, and
    having 3 feet more projection upon the north than upon the east face.
    The south wall terminates eastward in a bold, half-round bow of 42
    feet diameter, projecting on the east wall. This marks the apse of the
    chapel, and is the great peculiarity of this tower.</p>

  <p>The keep rises 90 feet from the floor to the crest of the present
    battlement. It is composed of three floors, or four stages. The walls
    are reinforced by the usual pilaster strips; on the east face two, on
    the north three, on the west and south four each. The round turret has
    four pilasters, two being at its junction with the walls, and the bow
    four. They vary from 3 feet to 6 feet broad, and all are of 18 inches
    projection. They lessen by two sets-off, at 50 feet and 75 feet from
    the ground, and die away 8 feet below the battlement. Also upon the
    flank of each front containing the two square angles is a strip 12
    feet broad, two to each angle, but so placed as not quite to cover
    it, so that three salient angles appear at each of the two corners.
    These four pilasters rise from the plinth unbroken to 16 feet above
    the battlement, forming square turrets. A third turret, also square,
    is placed on the roof, where, but for the bow, would be the south-east
    angle. Thus the keep is crowned by three square turrets and one round
    one.</p>

  <p>The loops of the basement are seen to open just below those, now
    windows, of the second stage. The openings of the third stage, once
    probably single-light windows of moderate size, but now enlarged,
    appear, one between each pair of pilasters, and each below a large
    plain round-headed and slightly-recessed relieving arch, springing from
    a strip of wall left as a sort of pier against each pilaster. The base
    of this arcade is a set-off in the wall stopped by the pilasters.</p>

  <p>The lights of the fourth or upper stage may be of about their original
    size. On the south wall, between the two western pilasters, the
    windows, of 2 feet opening, are in pairs, having a plain baluster in
    common, and each pair being within a shallow, round-headed recess, so
    that the eight windows form a short arcade. One pair are probably the
    only windows in the keep that present quite their original appearance;
    for the baluster, long since removed, was found bricked up in the
    adjacent wall, and is now in its proper place. It is believed to have
    been from one of these windows that Bishop Flambard, here a prisoner,
    let himself down. The exterior has been defaced by pointing with flint
    chips and mortar, and the substitution of Portland for the old ashlar
    dressings, but the windows, though enlarged into casements, represent
    the old openings.</p>

  <p>The staircase, 11 feet diameter, contained within the circular or
    north-east turret, rises from the floor to the summit, and communicates
    with every floor, and with the leads.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

  <p>The basement is slightly below ground on the north, and at the ground
    level on the south front. The walls are from 12 feet to 15 feet thick,
    and the internal area about 91 feet by 73 feet. This is crossed by
    a wall 10 feet thick, built with much neglect of the plumb-line. It
    rises to the summit, and divides the building into a larger western and
    smaller eastern portion. The latter is again subdivided into a larger
    northern and smaller southern part, by another wall, also carried
    through, so that every floor is divided into three chambers. The larger
    chambers are all ceiled with timber; all the smaller are vaulted. The
    basement was reached only from above by the great well-stair. The west
    chamber is 91 feet by 35 feet; the eastern, 67 feet by 28 feet; and the
    vault, the lower or sub-crypt of the chapel, known in Tower phrase as
    ‚ÄúLittle Ease,‚Äù is 15 feet by 47 feet, the east end being semicircular.
    A door leads from the east into the west chamber, and from the former
    into Little Ease. Bold recesses in the walls ascend to a line of loops,
    giving air, but very little light.</p>

  <p>In modern times a shaft has been sunk 10 feet in the south-west angle
    of this floor, and a tunnel cut through its 24 feet of foundation
    towards the river quay, and another door on the other side of the angle
    has been cut at the ground level. The two larger chambers have been
    vaulted in modern brick. Little Ease was, until recently, fitted up as
    a powder magazine, and passages cut through its east and west ends.
    These have now been carefully made good with old stone, and the vault
    cleared out. The well has lately been discovered. It is a plain pipe, 6
    feet diameter, lined with ashlar. It is in the floor of the keep, a few
    feet from its south-western angle.</p>

  <p>The second stage much resembles the basement. The walls are about 13
    feet thick, the cross-wall 8 feet. In the latter are three openings,
    6 feet wide and 15 feet high, round-headed and quite plain, between a
    doorway at the north end, 4 feet 6 inches wide and 12 feet high, and
    one at the south end, 4 feet wide and 9 feet high. These five openings
    communicate between the eastern and western chambers. The western
    room, 92 feet by 37 feet, has in its west wall five plain round-headed
    recesses, once converging into loops, but now enlarged into windows.
    In the south wall is a similar recess, and in the north wall are two.
    Between one of these and the west angle is a small mural passage,
    2 feet 10 inches wide, and bent at right angles. This is vaulted,
    quadripartite, with plain hips, very rough, but good. Under its
    exterior loop was the garderobe shaft.</p>

  <p>The eastern room, 68 feet by 30 feet, has in its east wall three
    recesses for loops. In its north wall is a recess, now cut into a door,
    and communicating with the outside by a double flight of modern stone
    steps. There is also an original door of 3 feet opening, leading by a
    short mural passage, 5 feet wide, to the well-stair, which supplies
    each stage. In the south wall a door leads into the crypt of the
    chapel, 13 feet 6 inches broad by 39 feet long, having an apsidal east
    end, and 17 feet high to the crown of its very plain vault. In the
    north wall of the crypt, near the apse, a passage 2 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> broad leads
    into a vaulted cell, 8 feet by 10 feet, formed in the wall, and quite
    dark. In the south wall three round-headed recesses, 6 feet broad and
    13 feet high, terminated in loops, as did one at the east end. This
    crypt was fitted up as an armoury, but has been cleared out, and the
    injured vaulting restored in good taste.</p>

  <p>The two larger rooms on this stage are 15 feet high, and recently their
    respective open ceilings were supported by eighteen and twelve large
    posts in double rows. These no doubt were inserted when the rooms
    were given up to stores and records. They have now been removed, and
    the beams stiffened with iron, to carry the weight of small-arms here
    stored up. Possibly there was originally a single line of posts, as 30
    feet and 37 feet are large spans for single untrussed beams. Recently,
    two plain original fireplaces have been discovered in the east wall.
    Their smoke was discharged, as at Colchester, by two small apertures in
    the wall.</p>

    <div class="caption">THE KEEP.‚ÄîTHIRD STAGE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Ascending by the well-stair from this stage, a Tudor door is seen cut
    in the shell of the staircase, and leading into the adjacent armourers‚Äô
    shops. A similar door, below this, has been cut at the ground level.</p>

  <p>The third stage, or second floor, has also three chambers: the
    western, 95 feet by 40 feet; the eastern, 64 feet by 32 feet; both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
    15 feet high, and until recently propped by posts. The cross chamber
    is the chapel, which occupies this and the upper stage, to the roof.
    The exterior walls are here 10 feet to 11 feet, and the party-wall 6
    feet thick. In the latter are five openings, as below, all apparently
    doorways. The rebates show that the doors of the four to the south
    opened into the east chamber, and the north door the other way. In the
    north wall, close to this door, are two mural garderobes, resembling
    that already described, one serving the west, and one the east room.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp38" id="i_211">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_211.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">FIREPLACE IN KEEP.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Within the north-west and south-west angles of this stage commence
    well-stairs, 9 feet diameter, which rise to the roof. They do not open,
    as usual, direct into the room; but, by short passages, into the jamb
    of the nearest loop recess. The east chamber is entered from the main
    stair in a similar way, by a passage 3 feet wide, in the north wall. In
    the south wall of this room is only a small door opening into the north
    aisle of the chapel. In its east wall are three loop recesses, and
    from the jamb of one a garderobe opens, resembling those described. In
    this wall also is the plain round-headed opening of a fireplace, with
    an inclined back and vertical flue, the outlet of which has not been
    followed. It resembles somewhat a fireplace in Colchester keep. This
    room is called the ‚ÄúBanqueting Chamber.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Besides its regular recesses for loops, 7 feet wide and 14 feet high,
    of which there are five on the west side, two on the north, and one on
    the south, the west room has in its south wall a round-headed opening,
    which is the summit and landing of a well-stair, which commences, about
    15 feet above the ground level, by an external door, and thence leads
    to the third stage. From its head there is also a mural passage leading
    into the west end of the south aisle of the chapel. This was, no doubt,
    the private way from the palace to the chapel and state-rooms of the
    keep. It was at the foot of this stair, in the wall, that were found
    the bones supposed to be those of the children of Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, and now
    in Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p>The fourth, or upper stage, is the ‚Äústate floor.‚Äù Its tripartite
    arrangement resembles those below, and the two larger chambers have
    open ceilings 21 feet high, until recently supported by posts,
    as below. The outer walls range from 10 feet to 11 feet thick,
    the party-wall is 6 feet, and the short cross-wall which shuts
    off the triforium of the chapel is 4 feet. The western, or great
    council-chamber, is 95 feet by 40 feet; the eastern, 65 feet by 32
    feet. Between them are three plain openings, 7 feet wide and 14 feet
    high, and, flanking these, two doorways of smaller dimensions. It may
    be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span> remarked that the square of the two western turrets is preserved
    in the council chamber. The angles project about 7 feet into the room.
    The north-eastern angle is hollow as usual. The exterior wall of these
    two chambers is threaded by a vaulted mural gallery, 13 feet high and
    3 feet to 3 feet 6 inches wide. One end of it opens into the west end
    of the south aisle of the chapel triforium, and the other end into its
    north aisle near the chevet. It communicates with the main stair in
    the north-east turret, and with those in the two western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> turrets. It
    pierces the jambs of each of the window recesses, of which there are in
    the west room five in the west wall, two in the north, and two in the
    south wall; and in the east room three in the east wall, and one in the
    north. Where the gallery traverses the window recesses, the vault is
    raised a step. In this gallery, in the south wall of the state-room,
    are the coupled windows already described as escaped through by
    Flambard. This was the royal council-chamber, at least as late as the
    reign of Richard <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Here Charles of Orleans, and probably John of
    France, were confined. And hence Edward, Lord Hastings, the celebrated
    Chamberlain, was taken from the council-board to execution.</p>

  <p>The vertical section of the keep, upon a line east and west, looking
    south, and here given, shows on the ground floor ‚ÄúLittle Ease,‚Äù and the
    lower store-room; on the first floor, the chapel crypt, and the upper

    lower armoury; on the third floor, the chapel triforium and space above

  <p>The chapel, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Evangelist, is a rare, if not a
    singular example of such an apartment, so large and so complete, in the
    original and interior arrangements of a Norman keep. It is in plan a
    rectangle, 40 feet by 31 feet, terminating eastward in a semicircular
    apse of its full breadth; its extreme length, therefore, with this
    addition, being 55 feet 6 inches.</p>

  <p>It is divided into a nave and aisles, the latter being continued as a
    chevet round the apse.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_214">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_214.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">THE KEEP.‚ÄîVERTICAL SECTION, EAST AND WEST.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The nave, 14 feet 6 inches broad, and 40 feet long, has an eastern
    apse, giving 7 feet 3 inches additional for the altar. It is divided
    from the aisles by four columns, and a western respond or half-column,
    on each side; and by four columns which contain the apse. The whole
    support thirteen arches. The columns are cylinders of 2 feet 6 inches
    diameter, and 6 feet 6 inches high, with plain torus bases resting upon
    a square stone of two stages, giving,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> with the base, an additional 20
    inches. The capitals vary in pattern, some being plain cushion, others
    a combination of four cushions, giving a scalloped or indented outline
    in the elevation; others, again, are chamfered at the angles; and
    others finished with a stiff rude volute of an Ionic aspect.</p>

  <p>The capitals of the eight eastern columns are unfinished, having a
    block in the form of a Tau, or cross-potent, upon each face, evidently
    intended to be carved into the usual central flower of a Corinthian
    capital; and the astragal is set round with a row of stiff upright
    feathers, like a plume. Each capital has a plain abacus, with varieties
    of the half-round, ogee, and hollow mouldings, excepting the western
    responds, of which the faces of the abaci are cut into the star-pattern
    found in early Norman work. Beneath is a light cable bead. These
    capitals vary from 34 inches to 40 inches square, and are 22 inches
    high, so that from the floor to the top of each is 10 feet. Each
    capital is a single block, and each abacus a single slab.</p>

  <p>The thirteen arches springing from these capitals in the nave are 7
    feet, and in the apse 2 feet 9 inches, diameter. The five apsidal
    arches are stilted, the rest semicircular, the crowns of all being
    level. The whole are perfectly plain openings in a 22-inch wall,
    without chamfer or rib.</p>

  <p>Twenty inches above these crowns is a plain chamfered stringcourse, and
    upon this the arcade of the triforium, each arch being exactly above,
    and of the same diameter with, that below. These arches spring from
    piers 30 inches square, and 4 feet 3 inches high, without either base
    or cap. As the apsidal arches are not stilted, the piers are taller, so
    that the crowns still range.</p>

  <p>The nave roof is a barrel vault, commencing imperceptibly at the crown
    level of the triforial arches, and ending eastwards in a semi-dome.
    The height to the crowns of the nave arches is 13 feet 6 inches, to
    those of the triforium 23 feet 9 inches, and to the crown of the vault
    32 feet. The vault abuts against the west wall, in which is a plain
    round-headed recess, 18 inches deep, 12 feet diameter, and 13 feet 6
    inches high.</p>

  <p>The aisle is 6 feet 6 inches broad. Opposite to each nave column is
    a flat pilaster, advanced three steps from the wall surface, and
    having a plain chamfered abacus, or string-cap, and from each springs
    a broad flat rib. The aisle is thus divided into thirteen bays, four
    on each side, and five in the chevet, the sides of these latter being
    convergent. Each bay is hip-vaulted, the vaults being groined, and
    entirely in rubble work. The aisle is 13 feet 6 inches high. The wall
    of each bay is recessed, and the recesses form an arcade. In the
    southern recesses are four windows, of which two open between, and two
    upon the exterior pilaster strips. Four of the five apsidal bays also
    have windows, one being to the east. There are two doors: one in the
    north aisle, opening into the eastern room on the third stage of the
    keep, and one in the west wall of the south aisle, leading by a short
    mural gallery to the well-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>stair in the south wall, and into the great
    or western chamber of the keep.</p>

  <p>The triforium is 7 feet 6 inches diameter. It is a mere plain gallery,
    without pilasters, stringcourse, or moulding of any kind, 8 feet high
    to the spring of its side barrel-vault, which gives 3 feet 9 inches
    more.</p>

  <p>In its south wall are three windows, one opening in the face of an
    outer pilaster; and in the apse are five. In the north wall, and at the
    west end of the south limb, are the openings of the mural gallery which
    surrounds the keep at this, the council-chamber level; the chapel, as
    has been stated, rising through the two upper stories to the roof. The
    walls of the aisle are 4 feet thick; of the west and east ends, 5 feet.
    Of the triforium, the north, south, and east walls are 4 feet, and the
    west wall 5 feet 6 inches thick.</p>

  <p>This, the earliest and simplest, as well as most complete Norman chapel
    in Britain, must have witnessed the devotions of the Conqueror, and
    his immediate descendants; the church, when afterwards built, having
    evidently been intended rather for the garrison at large than for the
    sovereign. The upper gallery, communicating with the state-rooms, was,
    no doubt, as was often the case in domestic chapels, intended for the
    principal persons, the household occupying the floor below. Always
    architecturally plain, the walls were probably painted and hung with
    tapestry, and the eastern windows contained stained glass, placed
    there, with other ornaments, by the piety of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>Henry also, in 1261, on the death of his sister-in-law, Saunchia,
    Countess of Cornwall, wife of his brother Richard, charged upon the
    Exchequer, in favour of the adjacent Hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine, fifty
    shillings per annum for the support of a chaplain, here to pray for her
    soul; he having already, 1240‚Äì1, provided a similar endowment for the
    sustenance of a regular priest there, with vesture, and chalice, and
    everything necessary for his office. The obit payment probably fell
    into arrear; for, in 1290 (18 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>), the Brethren and Sisters of
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine petition for the fifty shillings given by Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    for the spiritual benefit of Saunchia. This chapel was dismantled
    by an Order of Council, August 22, 1550, directing, in both church
    and chapel, all such crosses, images, and plate of gold as remain,
    to be melted down. The chapel thus desecrated was long employed as a
    repository for records. Very recently these have been removed, the
    walls restored to their primitive simplicity, and the whole paved with
    tiles of a plain and suitable character. It is due to the interference
    of the late Lord de Ros that this chapel did not become a tailor‚Äôs
    warehouse.</p>

  <p>Above the fourth stage of the keep is the flat leaded roof, affording
    an area between the parapet wall, of 100 feet east and west, by
    113 feet north and south. The turrets rise about 16 feet above the
    platform, upon which they open by doors, the north-west, south-west,
    and north-east crowning well-stairs. The fourth, or south-east turret,
    is built over the chapel wall, and contains a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> chamber entered from the
    leads. The large circular, or north-east turret, of 16 feet interior
    diameter, and of two floors, was used as an observatory by Flamsteed,
    before the construction of the present building at Greenwich. Its upper
    floor seems to have been entered by an exterior stair, on the south
    side, for the support of which the parapet, as may be seen, has an
    exterior projection. These turrets have been cased, but the old Norman
    masonry may still be detected.</p>

  <p>There is a sort of ‚Äúentre-sol‚Äù between the chapel-vault and the roof,
    which, over the aisles, is about 7 feet high, and capable of being
    turned to account. Some of the old drawings show loopholes pierced
    in the south wall, and there are traces in the south-west turret of
    a doorway, which seems, from its level, to have led into this vacant
    space.</p>

  <p>The place and manner of the original entrance to the keep are unknown.
    One notion is that it was on the north side, at the second stage, or
    first-floor level, near the east end of the wall, where there is at
    present an entrance by stone steps, 12 feet above the ground. This,
    however, is certainly an enlarged loop, the interior arch of the
    recess remaining. A close examination of the exterior shows that the
    present door has been cut through masonry not intended to cover a large
    opening, for the joints are horizontal, and there is no relieving arch.
    West of this in the next, or floor above, where also a modern door has
    been cut, through which stores are lifted into the armouries, there are
    traces of an arch of relief, intended to cover an opening of unusual
    size, and this also has been regarded as the original entrance. But
    this only seems to have been an enlarged loop; the recess has been
    enlarged by cutting away the wall, which at the sides has been refaced.
    This would have been unnecessary had the recess been intended for a
    doorway. More probably the entrance was on the south side near the west
    end, where, on this floor level, is a large and original opening with
    parallel sides and niches in the sides. Evidently this was the main
    entrance. The masonry shows where the doorway jambs and arch have been
    cut away, and a window inserted.</p>

  <p>Very near this doorway, to the east, is a small but original door
    opening into the base of the small well-stair. These two doors,
    being at some height above the ground, pretty certainly opened into
    a forebuilding which covered the south side of the keep, having its
    outer entrance at the east end. The armoury is now being removed,
    and possibly below it may be found the foundations of the Norman
    forebuilding.</p>

  <p>Although much injured and obscured by injudicious repairs, parts of the
    original surface may be detected. The base, quoins, and pilaster strips
    were evidently of ashlar, very open jointed. The rest of the wall was
    of rubble, rudely coursed, but with a great preponderance of mortar,
    much resembling the earliest work at Malling Abbey and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard‚Äôs
    Tower. The arches throughout are semicircular, and quite plain. The
    vaulting, though sometimes groined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> is never ribbed. It may also be
    remarked that there is no subterranean chamber in the keep, or anywhere
    throughout the fortress.</p>

  <p>The arrangements within the keep are very peculiar, and show a
    prevision against surprise, carried, if not to excess, yet to a degree
    fatal to the convenience of the royal personages and great officers of
    state, for whose deliberations and occasional residence the building
    was designed.</p>

  <p>The main door, supposing it to be as indicated, opened upon a very
    gloomy first floor, from which a turnpike stair led downwards to the
    basement, and upwards to the second floor. To this floor the way from
    the stair was along a bent and narrow mural passage, and from the inner
    room by two staircases to the upper story and battlements. Having
    attained the upper story, the entrance to the state-rooms was again
    only by mural galleries, admitting but one person abreast.</p>

  <p>For purely military purposes all this was advantageous. Supposing a
    score of resolute men to garrison the keep, they could hold the main
    door and postern against an army; or supposing them, by surprise, to
    have lost the lower stories, they could still defend the passage to
    the second floor without fear of being outflanked; while above there
    was easy access from the state-floor to the battlements, whence the
    enemy could be assailed to most advantage. There remained indeed to
    the besiegers the last and most terrible resource of firing the place,
    and, once within the walls, this would be easy and irresistible. Not
    even this immensely solid masonry would have resisted the conflagration
    which a torch flung upon the wooden floors of the building would be
    sure to kindle.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of state the great height of the council-chamber, its
    excessive coldness, the difficulty of access, the inconvenience of the
    frequent posts probably necessary for the support of its roof, and
    finally, the entire absence of privacy in a room so large and with so
    many lateral openings, must have been serious drawbacks. No doubt the
    rooms were bratticed off into smaller chambers, and hung with tapestry,
    but even then the presence of the floors, ceilings, and partitions must
    have rendered the employment of stoves and bratticed chimneys very
    dangerous.</p>

  <p>Neither is it easy to understand the intention of the arches in the
    party wall. Where, as at Rochester, these openings were of large span,
    the chambers admitted, on occasions of state, of being thrown into one.
    Here, however, though inconveniently large for doorways, they were far
    too small to make the rooms common. They could scarcely be intended to
    economise material, else the wall might have been safely much reduced
    in thickness, without piercing it completely through; and below they
    have no rebates or recesses for doors, or wooden partitions. On the
    third floor, where the doors are rebated, it is clear that they opened
    opposite ways, so that one, if not both the chambers, was subdivided.
    The rebates, however, may not be original.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

  <p>The absence of all ornament, the very sparing use of ashlar, and the
    general roughness of the work, especially of the lower floor of this
    keep, lead to the conclusion that it was executed in haste, and with
    an insufficient command of good material. The vaulting especially
    is very coarse, and impressions remaining upon, and the occasional
    fragments of oak imbedded in, the mortar, show that the centering
    was composed of small rough oak slabs, not even cut to lengths, but
    overlapping, and that occasionally the form of the arch was preserved
    by the intervention of a rough coat of mortar. This used to be apparent
    even in the vaults of the chapel, and may still be seen in the mural
    galleries and staircases.</p>

  <p>Against the east wall of the keep, a large rectangular building, now
    removed, was constructed, it is said, by Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> The lower walls
    were thick, and its south-east angle, which remains, seems to have been
    rounded off, perhaps as a turret. It is evidently an addition, and had
    nothing to do with any raised or covered entrance to the keep.</p>

  <p>The inner ward is enclosed within a curtain wall, having four sides,
    twelve mural towers, and a gatehouse. The base or longest side faces
    the river. The east and west sides incline inwards, so that the north
    face is narrower than the base. This face is broken by an obtuse angle,
    having a central salient.</p>

  <p>The level of much of this enclosure is 15 to 20 feet above that of the
    outer ward. Possibly part of the clay from the ditch, excavated by
    Longchamp, in the reign of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, was here piled up. By reason
    of this difference, the lower part of this ward wall is a revetment,
    retaining the ground along the west and north, and part of the south
    and east fronts. The inequality is seen at the gatehouse, the passage
    through which rises one foot in ten to the middle of the ward; and,
    at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin‚Äôs Staircase, at the north-east corner. Where the palace
    stood, from Wakefield to Salt Tower, the levels are nearly equal. This
    ward is much encumbered with buildings, some of the age of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>,
    some later, while others have been lately removed. No doubt this ward
    was always thus occupied, as the Tower was a dep√¥t for all sorts of
    military stores, and a residence for petty officers of the court and
    garrison. In 1213, King John ordered to be salted and hung up ‚Äú<span lang="la">bacones
    nostros qui sunt apud Turrim</span>‚Äù; and, in 1224, he drew upon the Tower for
    thirty dolia of wine; so that pigstyes and wine-stores formed a part
    of its contents. Lead, and the more expensive building-materials, were
    also kept here.</p>

  <p>The Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter ad Vincula, mentioned in the reign of John,
    and rebuilt in the late Perpendicular period, still occupies the
    north-west quarter of the ward. In the south-east quarter stood the
    Royal Palace, destroyed, at various times, by James, Cromwell, or after
    the Restoration. The keep in Norman castles was intended rather for
    the occasional than the regular residence of the lord, whose ordinary
    lodgings were more conveniently placed in the inner ward. This was
    so at Rochester, in 1281, at Bamborough, Carlisle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> Porchester, and
    elsewhere. Here the palace stood between the keep and the ward wall,
    and, besides, had walls of its own; one crossing from Wakefield Tower
    to the keep, where were drum-towers and a gateway known as Cold
    Harbour, and another called the Wardrobe Gallery, crossing from Broad
    Arrow Tower to the keep, and having upon it Wardrobe Tower, also
    circular, with a circular turret. The Queen‚Äôs Gallery extended from
    Salt to Lanthorn Tower, on the line of the curtain, and the great hall
    was connected with Wakefield Tower. The whole space was occupied by
    small courts and gardens, lodgings, and offices; and the buildings
    in the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> seem to have encroached upon the outer
    ward, where were two posterns for the service of the palace. These
    buildings, after the manner of royal houses, were always under repair;
    and seem to have absorbed much of the money expended on the Tower. The
    main guardhouse stands on the site of Cold Harbour. The foundation
    of the Queen‚Äôs Gallery and great hall have lately been laid open.
    Norman masonry, part of the ward-wall, has also been discovered. In
    the earlier surveys, the palace quarter is called the ‚ÄúInner Ward.‚Äù
    Cold Harbour was probably very lofty; for, in 1572, complaint was made
    that Sir Owen Hopton, the lieutenant, allowed his prisoners to meet
    and walk on the ‚Äúleads of Cold Harbour‚Äù; and about that time the Earl
    of Southampton stayed leaping upon the tower, his wife being on the
    opposite side of the ditch.</p>

  <p>Of the twelve mural towers of this ward one caps each of the five
    angles. Two were intermediate on the south face, as two still are upon
    the east, and two upon the north, one on each side of the salient.
    The west, or shortest face, has one large intermediate tower. The
    gatehouse, called the Bloody Tower, stands considerably west of
    the centre of the south front, and opposite to Traitor‚Äôs Gate. It
    is contiguous to Wakefield Tower, which flanks it on the east, and
    probably determined its position and that of Traitor‚Äôs Gate.</p>

  <p>Commencing with Wakefield, and passing westwards, the towers are,
    Bloody, Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin‚Äôs
    or Jewel, Constable‚Äôs, Broad-Arrow, Salt, and Lanthorn Tower, now
    destroyed.</p>

  <p>Wakefield Tower deserves very close attention, its lower story being
    next to the keep in antiquity. It is also known as the Record Tower,
    records having been kept there from an early period until a short time
    ago. In the survey of Elizabeth it is called the Hall Tower, from its
    proximity to the royal hall, destroyed during the Commonwealth.</p>

  <p>It is in plan a cylinder of 50 feet diameter, and is about 50 feet
    high. Its projection from the line of the south curtain is about 22
    feet. Whether it was originally intended to cap an angle, is uncertain.
    No doubt the curtains from Lanthorn Tower on the east, and Cold Harbour
    on the north, abutted upon it on two faces, and were co√´val with
    it; but it is unknown whether the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> curtain from the west, now
    replaced by the gatehouse, was of the same date; and, in fact, whether
    the original design included the present inner ward.</p>

  <p>This tower has two, and had three, stages. The basement, the floor of
    which is upon the ground level, contains an octagon chamber, 23 feet
    from face to face, with walls 13 feet 6 inches thick. In each face is
    a recess, 6 feet broad, having a semicircular head, the edge of which
    has a double chamfer, with an angular recess between. The northern and
    the three southern recesses are 8 feet deep, and have a flat end also
    6 feet across, so that there is no splay. In the end is an opening,
    round-headed, and about 4 feet across, which contracts rapidly to a
    loophole. The north-east and north-west recesses are 7 feet and 6 feet
    deep, and are blank, without loops. The west recess is only 2 feet 6
    inches deep, and was probably closed when the Bloody Tower was built.
    The eastern recess is the present entrance, but the curtain must have
    abutted on this side, so that it is not improbable that the original
    entrance was in the north-eastern recess. The chamber is, however, so
    dark, and the recesses so obscured and encumbered by stores and brick
    walls, that it is difficult to examine them minutely.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_221">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_221.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">BLOODY AND WAKEFIELD TOWERS.‚ÄîBASEMENT.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The chamber is 10 feet high. It has a flat timber covering, which,
    if not original, is very old, and may well represent the original.
    Probably it actually dates from the rebuilding of the upper story, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
    the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> In the centre of the chamber, upon a plain
    stone cheese-like base, is set up an oak post, 18 inches square, with
    the angles taken off. Upon this rest two beams, 11 inches square, at
    right angles, crossing the chamber east and west, and north and south.
    Parallel to the former, 2 feet from it on each side, are two other
    similar beams also crossing the chamber. There are, therefore, left
    outside these beams, and divided by the north and south beam, four
    quadrants, and these are filled up each with five beams, also 11 inches
    square, which radiate fan-like towards the walls, where all seem to
    have rested upon a stone ledge or wall-plate. The radiating beams are
    mortised into the main beams. All this work is original. These timbers
    have rotted at the wall ends, and to support them, and the load of
    records above them, two octagonal frames have been placed beneath, one
    close to the wall, and one half-way between the walls and the central
    post, and these are supported each by eight props, so that the interior
    of the chamber is disfigured by a regular forest of seventeen posts.
    East of this tower the foundation of the old curtain has been laid open.</p>

  <p>Since these lines were written, all this timber work has been swept
    away, and the tower has been converted into the jewel office. On the
    north-east side of the tower is a later well-stair, 6 feet 6 inches
    diameter, which ascends to the first floor and the battlements.</p>

  <p>This upper or first floor, also an octagon chamber, is of 30 feet
    diameter, and has a recess in seven of its eight faces. Of these
    three to the south, and that to the north-west, terminate in modern
    enlargements of the old windows, as does that of the west, of which the
    opening is skewed, to avoid the Bloody Tower. In the north face is a
    fireplace, probably representing an original one. The north-east recess
    is closed at 4 feet deep, and that to the east is occupied by two
    openings; one, the present door, evidently not original; close north of
    which, beneath a drop arch, is the original entrance from the palace,
    5 feet 5 inches broad, and at 2 feet 6 inches deep reduced to 4 feet
    broad, where it forms a lofty doorway, now closed. These recesses have
    each a drop arch, supported by a plain chamfered rib.</p>

  <p>The south-east recess was intended for an oratory, and its sides are
    produced inwards by two walls, buttressed in tabernacle work at their
    west ends, and connected above by a bold plain drop arch, rather light,
    and flatter than the rest. This no doubt is the chapel mentioned in
    1238. It is possible that the recess to the north-east was the royal
    door, and that the narrow eastern opening led to the stair and to the
    rampart of the curtain.</p>

  <p>The south recess also differs from the rest, in having within it a
    second rib, of 3 feet opening, as though above a doorway, and the
    opening is twisted to bring it opposite to the door of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs
    Tower, between which openings, 18 feet apart, there was evidently
    either a cross-wall or a light bridge, giving a short cut from the
    palace to the ramparts of the water-gate.</p>

  <p>The intention was to vault this chamber, and in each angle is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
    semi-octagon pier, with a rude base, and without a cap. The total
    height of the ceiling, now flat, is 25 feet, so that the vault was to
    have had a high pitch with eight cells. It is clear that this never was
    executed.</p>

  <p>This tower has now undergone complete restoration, all the interior
    fittings have been cleared out, the masonry laid bare, and the two
    floors vaulted, and the bridge suggested as having led to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs
    Tower has been actually built.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A line of blocked-up arches in the outer wall shows that an uppermost
    story was contemplated, and probably constructed, since in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Thomas‚Äôs Tower is a second or upper door, evidently intended for a
    second bridge, or a passage along a cross rampart, above that already
    mentioned.</p>

  <p>The arch-rings within, and the whole of the basement story without, of
    this tower, are of finely-jointed ashlar, and it appears from the decay
    of some of the stones, and from other indications, that the joints were
    not mere face-work, but were equally fine through the whole depth of
    each outer stone, a degree of precision not common now, and rare at any
    age. The upper story is of uncoursed rubble. It has been pointed and
    stuck over with chips of flint, but the acute relieving arches over the
    windows are seen, both of the first and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> second floor. The parapet is
    of brick, and encrusts an older wall of stone.</p>

  <p>The basement of Wakefield Tower is probably late Norman, perhaps of the
    reign of Stephen, or Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, although this is no doubt early for
    masonry so finely jointed. The superstructure is early in the reign of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, perhaps 1220‚Äì30, as in 1238 mention is made of the chapel
    in the new tower next the hall, and towards the Thames. The records
    of the realm were lodged in the New Temple as late as 20 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>,
    but 33 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, they were in the Tower, no doubt the keep, whence
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">extra magnam turrim</span>,‚Äù to make room for King John of France, they were
    removed, 1360, probably to this tower. In August of that year the clerk
    of the works was to repair the roof, doors, and windows of the house
    provided for the records, and this is repeated next year for the tower
    in which are the Chancery rolls.</p>

  <p>The Wakefield Tower was the subject of a restoration in 1867, when
    all its modern disfigurements were removed, and the original masonry
    exposed. The brick casing was stripped from the parapet, the roof taken
    down, the interior fittings cleared away, and the brick and stone work
    with which the loops, enlarged into windows, had been made good, was
    removed.</p>

  <p>The clearance included certain public garderobes, built against the
    north face of the tower, and a private garderobe, niched into the
    junction with the Bloody Tower, and thus was shown the original base of
    the latter, and the remains of a bold cordon encircling it 6 feet from
    the ground. Here also was exposed a loop and a curious hole, about 3
    feet diameter, and 3 feet or 4 feet deep, of doubtful use. Besides the
    removal of these additions, the timber work of the ground-floor was
    cleared out, and the double circle of posts shown to be of modern date,
    inserted to support the additional weight of the records. The timbers
    of the ceiling were original. The main beams of oak, 6 feet by 6 feet,
    went deep into the wall, and were evidently laid when the upper floor
    was added by Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> They rested upon fragments of early roofing
    tiles.</p>

  <p>The central post, also of oak, was found to stand upon a plain stone
    cylinder 2 feet 6 inches diameter and 3 feet 6 inches high. This again
    rested upon a thick square slab of oak, which was placed upon the head
    of a short pile, only partially decayed. Beneath the floor was laid 2
    feet of broken tiles, and below this, gravel, so charged with moisture
    that a pit sunk 5 feet stood with 2 feet of water.</p>

  <p>Of the arched recesses the masonry was sound, save a crack in the
    spandrels of that to the west. It was clear that the three southern
    recesses had contained original loops. That to the west seemed to have
    been walled up when the Bloody Tower was built. The northern recess
    was different, as though the loop had been lifted on account of the
    exterior ground having been raised.</p>

  <p>The vaulting ribs of the first floor did not seem to have been
    completed. The north-western recess had been a fireplace, which the
    original herring-bone fire-back showed to have been very shallow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span> so
    as to require a hood, which two holes in the wall indicated to have
    been of timber. The south-eastern aperture was double. There was a
    small window with a drop arch and hollow chamfer, and steps up to it,
    and by its side a doorway pointing to the Water Tower, and no doubt
    intended to open on a small bridge.</p>

  <p>The eastern recess now shows the oratory. The original window was
    narrow and drop pointed. On the wall are traces of fresco painting.
    There is also a piscina and a locker, and on each side a recess as for
    a sedile. That in the north wall has been cut as though for a doorway.
    The original door to this floor seems to have been in the north-east
    side.</p>

  <p>There was evidently a floor above this. In the exterior wall are some
    cylindrical holes about 2 feet deep and 2 inches diameter. Their use is
    not clear. There were gurgoyles below the embrasures of the parapet.
    It is well to rebuild the bridge to the Water Tower, but to vault the
    ground-floor would be a mistake. The lower floor covering was always
    timber, and of a curious pattern. It should be replaced.</p>

  <p>The Bloody Tower is the gatehouse of the inner ward. It stands in the
    south front, west of the centre, opposite to the earlier Traitor‚Äôs
    Gate, and it abuts against the also earlier Wakefield Tower. The
    exterior face ranges with the curtain. Its position was no doubt
    determined by the Traitor‚Äôs Gate, and by the advantages offered by the
    flanking defence of Wakefield Tower on the outside, and Cold Harbour
    Wall on the inside.</p>

  <p>It is rectangular or nearly so in plan, 25 feet broad and 38 feet deep,
    and pierced by a vaulted passage, the axis of which has a twist to the
    east. It is of three stages, and 47 feet high from the outer gate cill
    to the parapet, which is modern, and of brick.</p>

  <p>The portal, 15 feet wide, opens under a low-browed drop arch, 8 feet
    high at the spring, and 14 feet at the crown; 3 feet 6 inches within
    the entrance is a 6-inch portcullis groove, working through the vault
    in a chase 2 feet 6 inches broad, so as to admit a heavy wooden
    frame. Then follows a double chamfered gateway, reducing the passage
    to 11 feet 8 inches. Next is the body of the gatehouse, 21 feet long
    and vaulted, having a pair of gates at each end, and on the right
    a porter‚Äôs lodge. The inner pair of gates are succeeded by another
    chamfered gateway of 11 feet opening, and this by a second portcullis,
    with a chase only 1 foot 4 inches broad, followed by a portal of 15 ft.
    opening. The passage rises about one foot in ten, and this rise, giving
    a great advantage to the defenders, is continued to a point opposite to
    the White Tower, where it ends in a short flight of steps.</p>

  <p>The vaulted space occupying the central part of the passage is about
    22 feet long by 13 feet broad, and is divided into two not quite equal
    bays. The vaulting ribs spring from four corner and two intermediate
    corbels, representing lions‚Äô heads, each supporting an octangular
    bracket.</p>

  <p>Each bay is divided by four main hip ribs into four cells, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span> along
    the axis of each cell is a ridge rib, longitudinal and transverse.
    These cells are subdivided each by a secondary rib, springing also
    from the six corbels, and, with the ridge rib, dividing each cell into
    four compartments. Thus, besides the two wall half-ribs, from each
    intermediate corbel spring seven ribs, and from each angle corbel three
    ribs.</p>

  <p>There are no regular bosses, but at each point of intersection the ribs
    abut upon an open circle, the centre of which is occupied by a lion‚Äôs
    face, dropped in from above. There are, therefore, three main and eight
    smaller circles, besides six half-circles at the junction of the ridge
    and wall-ribs. The ribs and circles, though of one pattern, are of two
    sizes. All have been clumsily cobbled with Roman cement.</p>

  <p>The porter‚Äôs lodge, on the east side of the entrance, is a vaulted
    chamber, 10 feet square, with a window of two lights, no doubt
    replacing a loop towards the south or front. A door, now closed, on its
    north side, seems to have led into a staircase to the upper floors.
    About 4 feet of this lodge is excavated in the thickness of the wall of
    Wakefield Tower.</p>

  <p>The entrance-way, on passing the gatehouse, lies between a retaining
    wall on the left, or west, and the main guard, which supersedes Cold
    Harbour wall, on the right. A modern staircase, no doubt representing
    an old one, ascends in the substance of the west wall, and opens on the
    parade before the constable‚Äôs house, and here also is the entrance to
    the first floor of the gatehouse.</p>

  <p>This is by a Decorated, or early Perpendicular door, leading into a
    chamber 28 feet by 18 feet, having a large double-light window in
    the west wall by the door, and in the east wall a loop towards Cold
    Harbour, and a passage which, through a Caernarvon-headed door, leads
    into a small vaulted and ribbed garderobe on the left, and onward into
    what is no doubt the well-stair from below, now closed; and which seems
    to have ascended to the roof.</p>

  <p>This, which was the portcullis chamber, has also windows at either end
    over the portals, and across its south end a low four-centred arch, in
    which are fastened two sheaves carrying the portcullis, which rises
    through a chase in the floor, and is lifted by a rude long wooden
    windlass worked by three sets of capstan bars.</p>

  <p>The northern portcullis was lighter, and perhaps never actually
    inserted. The only trace of its working arrangements is a part of a
    flat-topped recess, from which it might have been suspended.</p>

  <p>An upper floor, reached by a well-stair cut in the wall between this
    and the Wakefield Tower, contains a room 25 feet long by 18 feet broad,
    at the south end of which is walled off a passage 26 feet long by 4
    feet broad, at the west end of which a door, now walled up, opened
    upon the ramparts, showing that this curious passage made a part of
    the rampart walk, which accounts for a door and loop which opens upon
    it from the gatehouse upper floor. The well-stair is continued to the
    leads of the tower, 10 feet above the curtain.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

  <p>The doors, window, and portcullis arch in the first floor, all have a
    deep bold quarter-circle hollow, replacing the angle, instead of the
    usual chamfer.</p>

  <p>This gatehouse is generally attributed to Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, who may have
    constructed it in the later part of his reign; or it may be the work of
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> The vaulting and portcullis-arch appear of later date than
    the walls, but the whole is probably of the transition period between
    Decorated and Perpendicular.</p>

  <p>In the survey of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> this is called the Garden Tower, being
    close to the constable‚Äôs garden, now the parade. In the survey of 1597,
    it is called by its present name; and popular prejudice, rather than
    Tower tradition, has attributed that name to the murder of the sons of
    Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, idly said to have been perpetrated here.</p>

    <div class="caption">BELL TOWER.‚ÄîBASEMENT.</div>
  </div>

  <p>As Garden Tower, this building was a well-known Tudor prison. From
    hence to Bell Tower, 150 feet, the original curtain remains, of its
    full height of about 40 feet, and its base thickness about 10 feet. It
    is, however, so defaced outside, and inside so encrusted with houses
    of the Tudor period, that but little of its detail can be seen. It is
    pretty clear that there is no range of loopholes in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> substance. A
    cell, recently a stable, is really a Tudor brick vault built against it.</p>

  <p>Near to Bell Tower is an original mural chamber, probably a garderobe,
    lighted by a recess and loop. This recess shows the original wall,
    about 7 feet thick; and an interior addition of 3 feet more. The
    original recess has an acute, and the addition a drop arch. The one may
    be early English, and the other of Decorated date. Above this the full
    thickness of the wall is seen in the great modern window, cut through
    it, in the constable‚Äôs lodging.</p>

  <p>Bell Tower is so called from the alarm bell once suspended from its
    summit. The bell now discharges the less exciting duty of summoning the
    garrison to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter‚Äôs Church, and the bell turret has been replaced
    by a <i lang="la">gazebo</i>. The tower caps the south-west angle of the ward,
    and stands 40 feet within the Byward Gate, which it commands. It is in
    plan an irregular octagon, about 35 feet mean diameter, and 60 feet
    high, from the level of the outer ward. Five and a half of its sides
    project beyond the curtains. Above, the angles are rudely rounded off,
    and the upper 20 feet is cylindrical, and may be an early addition.
    The two southern faces have a chamfered plinth, 6 feet high. The walls
    have been stuck over with chips of flint, and the parapet is a brick
    addition; but it is evident that the basement was originally of fine
    jointed ashlar, almost equal to Wakefield. Five cruciform loops mark
    the line of the interior basement, about 14 feet above the exterior
    ground.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp48" id="i_228">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_228.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">BELL TOWER.‚ÄîFIRST FLOOR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The lower 10 feet of this tower is solid, and above this are two
    stages. The basement, now a cellar and boot-hole, is of irregular plan,
    and may be called a rectangular figure with inclined ends. The walls
    are from 9 feet to 13 feet thick, and contain four pointed arched
    recesses with loops, and a mural chamber, also looped. The entrance
    passage from the gorge is bent at right angles.</p>

  <p>This chamber is vaulted and ribbed, its outer end terminating in a rude
    pentagon, traversed by five hip-ribs, of plain rectangular section,
    and meeting by a high-pitched arch, in a central boss. This boss and
    the capitals whence spring three of the ribs are of early English
    character. The shafts are wanting.</p>

  <p>The upper chamber is rudely circular, and about 18 feet across. The
    walls are 8 feet thick. From the well-stair, which commences at this
    level, a short passage opens into a rectangular lobby, also vaulted, 4
    feet by 5 feet 6 inches, from which a door leads into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span> chamber, and
    another into a small flag-roofed mural gallery, which threads the south
    wall for 22 feet, and has two loops, one raking the south curtain, the
    other lighting a garderobe, which seems to have another opening direct
    into the tower.</p>

  <p>The main chamber was lighted by four loops, of which two have been
    converted into windows, and two stopped up. These recesses are of
    irregular breadth, with high drop arches, the crowns 10 feet 3 inches
    from the ground, with traces of a broad moulding above each. The north
    loop rakes the west curtain, and has cupboards right and left under
    flat drop arches for archers‚Äô tools. Another has a lateral squint
    towards the south, and another, with a hole in its arch, widened by the
    rubbing of the old bell-rope, has evidently been used as a doorway.
    No doubt it opened upon the gatehouse, now removed, which crossed the
    outer ward at this point, close north of the Byward gate. This chamber
    is rudely domed in with overhanging courses of tile stone and flat
    rubble, like an ancient dovecote. No doubt a proper vault was intended.
    To the spring of the dome is 14 feet, to its crown 22 feet.</p>

  <p>It was in this chamber that, in 1830, was discovered an inscription
    commemorating the imprisonment here, 20th June, 1565, of Lady Mary
    Douglas, Countess of Lennox, on account of the marriage of her son,
    Lord Darnley, to the Queen of Scots.</p>

  <p>The well-stair ascends from this floor to the battlements; and at its
    foot a narrow door, set in a square recess, opens upon the rampart wall
    of the west curtain, leading to the Beauchamp Tower. The Bell Tower has
    been the subject of an interesting paper by the Rev. Thomas Hugo, read
    in Suffolk Street, in 1858. It may safely be attributed to the reign of
    John, or even of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, that is, to the last twenty years of the
    twelfth century.</p>

  <p>The curtain, from Bell to Beauchamp Tower, 138 feet in length, 37 feet
    high above the outer, and 18 feet above the inner ward, and 10 feet
    thick, is very perfect, but still much encrusted by dwelling-houses.
    The exterior of this wall shows eleven loops about 12 feet from the
    ground, and 12 feet apart, and these are found within to represent
    eleven recesses of 7 feet 4 inches opening, with drop arches of 3 feet
    4 inches rise, so that the curtain was pierced by an arcade intended
    for the defence of its base against the outer ward, but which would
    have been fatal to the security of the heavy superstructure, had the
    most ordinary battering engine been brought to bear upon it. The recess
    next to Beauchamp Tower seems to have been walled up when that tower
    was built. At the base of the parapet was a stringcourse, now much
    mutilated. The rampart walk remains open, but a part of it lies between
    the roofs of houses. The loops are of one pattern, of about four inches
    opening, and cruciform. The three upper ends are square; the lower
    expands into a round oillet.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_230">
    <div class="caption">THE CURTAIN.‚ÄîGROUND PLAN.</div>
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_230.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>This mural arcade is very singular. Such of the recesses as are
    accessible are found to be lined with brick, and can scarcely, in
    their present form, be earlier than the reigns of Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> or
    Richard <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> if so early. In fact, they much resemble the work of
    Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> The openings themselves are, however, original. They
    evidently exist also beyond the Beauchamp to the Devereux Tower, as the
    loops are visible, although the back of the wall is so shut in with
    dwelling-houses and the vaults of the church, as to be inaccessible.
    Nothing like them has been detected between the Bell and Bloody Tower,
    or in the fragments of the original curtain on the east side, about the
    Broad Arrow Tower. In the short low cross curtains connected with Salt
    Tower, something like these recesses may be seen, and apparently of
    early date. In rebuilding the curtain next to Broad Arrow Tower these
    recesses have very judiciously been copied.</p>

  <p>The Beauchamp, or Cobham Tower, stands towards the centre of the west
    wall, into which it has been inserted, either as an addition, or more
    probably in place of an earlier tower. Its plan is a semicircle of 36
    feet exterior diameter, and 18 feet projection beyond the curtain. The
    exterior wall is 8 feet, and the gorge wall 4 feet thick, and ranging
    with the inner face of the curtain.</p>

  <p>This tower is of three stages, not vaulted, the middle being at the
    rampart level. A well-stair, 9 feet diameter, in the curtain, close
    south of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> tower, opens from the inner ward, and communicates with
    each floor, the curtain ramparts, and the battlements of the tower. The
    stair is looped toward the field, and its passage has a small window
    towards the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The middle chamber is that possessing most interest, from the number
    and quality of the memorials cut upon its walls by its distinguished
    prisoners. Its plan is rectangular, with a western bow of three sides
    of an octagon. In the gorge wall is a large modern restored window,
    and in the bow two loops and one central window, no doubt once a loop,
    towards the field. One face is occupied by a fireplace, perhaps of
    modern date. Though used as a prison, it was evidently constructed for
    defence only, as a <i lang="fr">place d‚Äôarmes</i> upon the rampart. Hence the
    rampart walk is continued right through it, and from the passage opens
    a small mural chamber 6 feet by 8 feet, with a loop to the field, and
    near it a small mural garderobe, 5 feet by 4 feet. The staircase on the
    south, and these chambers on the north, occupy the two square turrets
    which flank the Beauchamp Tower.</p>

  <p>Beauchamp Tower is in the Decorated style, and the work of the
    fourteenth century, probably of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> It is evidently later than
    the contiguous curtain into which it has been inserted. Its name of
    Beauchamp is probably derived from Thomas Earl of Warwick, who was
    imprisoned here towards the end of the fourteenth century, and it has
    also been called ‚ÄúCobham,‚Äù from the well-known prisoner of that name,
    who was lodged here in consequence of Wyatt‚Äôs conspiracy. It is built
    of uncoursed rubble, much resembling <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs and Salt Tower,
    and very different from the basements of Wakefield, Bell, and Martin
    towers. The rubble is broken into vertical compartments by lines of
    ashlar, or single stones, set like coign stones, though on a plain
    surface.</p>

  <p>The curtain from Beauchamp to Devereux Tower is 148 feet in length,
    and about 30 feet high outside, the rampart being level, and the
    ground rising. It is original, and about 10 feet thick, except where
    it expands to 14 feet on joining the Beauchamp Tower. The cells in its
    base are indicated by their exterior loops. Near to Devereux Tower this
    curtain has been altered and renewed, and a raised platform, covering
    the church vaults, and a brick chamber, annexed to the tower, have been
    built against it.</p>

  <p>Devereux Tower caps the north-west angle of the ward. In plan it is
    about three-quarters of an irregular circle, 35 feet across at the
    gorge, and of about 30 feet projection. It is of two stages; the lower
    10 feet or 12 feet being solid. A well-stair at its junction with the
    north curtain leads downwards from the church platform to the basement,
    and to a vaulted garderobe, 7 feet 10 inches by 6 feet 7 inches with
    two exterior loops, and one towards the inner ward. This is in the
    curtain.</p>

  <p>The basement is of an irregular figure, a sort of polygon of four very
    unequal sides, with a curved outer end. It is vaulted, and its outward
    portion has three, and its inward four hip-ribs, plain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> chamfered, and
    13 inches broad, springing from the wall without pier or corbel, and
    meeting irregularly in mitred joints at the crown. The wall is about
    12 feet thick, and in two of the sides and the curved end are three
    round-headed recesses of 7 feet 6 inches opening, intended for loops,
    but now fitted with windows. The ring-stones of these recesses appear
    original, and much resemble those in Wakefield Tower.</p>

  <p>The entrance door from the stairs has a slightly drop arch, and near
    it another similar but larger door, set in a deep recess, opens into a
    vault about 22 feet by 16 feet, looped outwards. This vault is a Tudor
    casemate of brick, but half of it is in the old curtain, and probably
    old, though lined. As the door is certainly old, this may have been
    an original mural chamber, or it may have opened on the ‚Äúterre-plein‚Äù
    before the church vaults were built. The vaulting of the tower is
    chalk, the ribs and coigns of harder material. Possibly the walls and
    recesses of this tower are late Norman, of the age of the Wakefield,
    and the ribs and vaulting early English, or later additions, or, which
    is more probable, the whole is of one date, Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, or John. It
    is a very curious structure. Bayley says that courses of tiles were
    seen in the masonry like those found in the adjacent city wall, of
    the fragments of which it may certainly have been constructed. If the
    whitewash were removed, and the exposed masonry examined, we should
    probably learn whether the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> base of the tower be a part of the ancient
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the fortress, the work of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> or his son.</p>

    <div class="caption">DEVEREUX TOWER.‚ÄîBASEMENT.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The survey of 1597 shows two circular turrets at its junction with its
    curtains, and calls it ‚ÄúRobyn the Devyll‚Äôs Tower,‚Äù or, later, ‚ÄúDevelin
    Tower.‚Äù Its present appellation is derived from Robert Earl of Essex,
    confined here in 1601. The superstructure is modern.</p>

  <p>Flint Tower was taken down in the last century, and rebuilt of brick,
    and was again rebuilt in stone, a few years ago. In its present form
    it is a rectangle, 40 feet square, having a slight interior and bold
    exterior projection, and its outer face is rounded. The survey of 1597
    shows the interior projection and the usual flanking turrets, but the
    whole of the present tower appears new, and even the exterior base is
    either new or has been cased. In the curtain, close west, is a modern
    staircase in the wall.</p>

  <p>The curtain from Devereux to Flint Tower, 90 feet, though capped with a
    modern parapet, and casemated within, seems in substance to be old; as
    does the curtain, also 90 feet, from Flint to Bowyer Tower.</p>

  <p>Bowyer Tower caps the salient of 160 degrees which breaks the north
    front of this ward. It is in plan half-round, flat-sided, of 45 feet
    diameter, 28 feet projection from the exterior of the curtain, and
    ranging with its interior face, here thickened by the addition of
    modern casemates. It had in 1597 one circular turret at its junction
    with its east curtain. The basement is original, and only altered by
    the substitution of windows for loops. In plan it is rectangular, with
    a bow of three faces, in each a recess for a loop, the walls being 10
    feet thick. There is also a blank recess in the west wall. The entrance
    door is in the south side, and close east of it is a smaller door,
    communicating with a chamber in the east wall. Above the entrance door
    is a trace of a large closed-up arch in the wall. The arches are all
    drop pointed. The chamber is vaulted, and from its angles, without
    piers or corbels, spring four plain, heavy, chamfered hip-ribs, which
    meet, without boss or ornament, in the crown. They are of the pattern
    of those in Devereux Tower, and no doubt of rather early Decorated
    date, and probably of the reign of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>The upper floor is wholly new, as is the whole casing of the exterior.</p>

  <p>Bowyer Tower was, from an early date, the residence and probably
    workshop of the royal maker of bows. In 1223, Grillot was making
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">balistas corneas</span>‚Äù; and, for his encouragement, he had, in 1224, a robe
    for his wife. Soon afterwards the Archbishop of York had orders to send
    up Roger Balistarius, with all his implements, to the Tower, paying his
    expenses. Bayley gives a good perspective drawing of the interior.</p>

  <p>From Bowyer to Brick Tower, 62 feet, the curtain is lined with modern
    casemates, but seems in substance original, though capped with a new
    parapet, and cased at its exterior base.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

  <p>Brick Tower, in 1532 Burbidge Tower, was, in 1597, shown as a
    half-round, with a circular turret upon its eastern flank, in the base
    of which was a mural chamber, and no doubt a staircase. It appears to
    have been recently rebuilt from the foundation, and is now a horseshoe
    tower, of 44 feet diameter, and 42 feet at the gorge, applied to very
    ignoble purposes. Its projection from the curtain is 36 feet.</p>

  <p>The curtain from hence to Martin‚Äôs Tower, 65 feet, seems to have been
    rebuilt. It is casemated, and, close to the latter tower, is pierced
    for a staircase of twenty-seven steps, which ascends from the outer to
    the inner ward, and shows the point of greatest difference of level
    between them.</p>

  <p>Martin‚Äôs, or Jewel, formerly Brick, Tower, was, until recently, the
    residence of the keeper of the jewels. It caps the north-east angle
    of the ward, and is in plan an irregular circle 40 feet diameter. Its
    base for 12 feet or 14 feet, seen in the outer ward, is solid; but,
    unlike the other towers, is mere rough foundation work, evidently
    intended to be covered up. Possibly Brass Mount, a bastion of the outer
    ward, just in front of this tower, was a small mound or cavalier, and
    extended backwards to the tower. But, however this may have been, the
    outer ward, at the base of this tower, was certainly 10 feet to 12 feet
    higher than it now is.</p>

  <p>Above the foundation, the wall of the tower, some way up the basement
    floor, is of fine close-jointed ashlar, like that of Bell Tower. Still
    higher, the wall is rubble, with vertical lines of ashlar, as described
    in Beauchamp Tower.</p>

  <p>The interior of this tower is so disfigured with lath-and-plaster
    partitions, and linings of wood, and so cut up into small domestic
    apartments, that little or nothing can be made of its original details,
    which probably remain but slightly altered. The basement floor, until
    recently the jewel-house, and now a kitchen, is circular, or nearly
    so, in plan, with three loops opening beneath pointed arch recesses.
    This floor has plain chamfered ribs. The entrance was at the gorge;
    and on the right, or south, is a well-stair; and on the left traces of
    a mural chamber. These, no doubt, occupied the two circular turrets
    shown appended to this tower in the view of 1597. The first floor is
    evidently original, though still more obscured than that below. This
    tower is probably of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>The jewels seem to have been moved here soon after 1641, from the south
    side of the White Tower, then used as a powder-magazine, which it was
    feared might be endangered by the adjacent chimneys.</p>

  <p>The Crown jewels, regalia, and the public treasures were originally
    lodged in the New Temple. King John, however, employed the Tower
    as a treasury; and sent 4,000 marks thither in 1212. The Bishop of
    Winchester was his treasurer there in 1215. In 1218, when De Faukenberg
    was treasurer, money was kept both here and at the Temple. 37 Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> (1252‚Äì3), the royal jewels and treasure were kept at both places.
    But, in that year, the regalia were sent, sealed up, to the Tower; and,
    from this reign, the treasury was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> here. Thus (14 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) certain
    jewels are described as ‚Äú<span lang="fr">En la Blaunche Tour deinz la tour de Londres</span>.‚Äù
    And (18 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) are mentioned: ‚Äú<span lang="la">Claves interioris camer√¶ juxta
    aulam nigram in Turre LondÀ¢. ubi jocalia Regis privata reponuntur.</span>‚Äù
    And (30 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) we hear of the ‚Äú<span lang="fr">Tresorie deinz la haute Toure
    de Londres</span>.‚Äù Long afterwards there were, perhaps, two strong places;
    for (20 James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>) occurs: ‚ÄúHis Majesty‚Äôs secret Jewell house in the
    Tower.‚Äù‚Äî[‚ÄúKal. of the Exch.,‚Äù iii. 197, 208, 225, 424.] And such
    entries are numerous.</p>

  <p>It was in 1673, while the regalia were in Martin‚Äôs Tower, that the
    attempt of the notorious Colonel Blood was made upon them.</p>

  <p>Constable‚Äôs Tower stands 102 feet south of Martin‚Äôs Tower. It seems
    to have resembled Broad Arrow Tower in pattern and dimensions; but it
    has, to all appearance, been recently rebuilt from the foundations.
    It is now a half-round tower of 32 feet diameter, rising a story
    above the curtain, which seems also to have been rebuilt. It bore its
    present name under Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, and was a prison at least as early as
    1641.‚Äî[Harl. MS., 1326.]</p>

  <p>From hence to Broad Arrow Tower, the curtain, 102 feet in length,
    seems, for the most part, to be old; but it is completely locked in, on
    both faces, by houses.</p>

  <p>Broad Arrow Tower, though obscured by modern buildings, does not
    seem to have been much altered. In general arrangement it resembles
    Beauchamp Tower, but has only two stages, and is much smaller, being
    26 feet diameter, with a projection on the curtain of 13 feet. Its
    inner face is flush with the curtain. On each flank is a small square
    turret. That on the north contains a steep narrow stair, not a well,
    entered below by a Caernarvon doorway. That on the south contains a
    small chamber, probably a garderobe. The ground floor is entered from
    the gorge, and is a rude, half-round chamber with three loops under
    drop-pointed arches.</p>

  <p>The upper chamber seems to have had four outward faces, and a loop in
    each; and another in the gorge wall. The mural chamber, 6 feet by 4
    feet, has a lancet vault and door, and a loop commanding its curtain
    southward. A passage from the rampart traverses the upper floor, making
    it a <i lang="fr">place d‚Äôarmes</i>. The stair is continued to the battlements.
    In 1532, this was ‚Äúthe tower at the east end of the wardrobe,‚Äù and as
    late as the reign of Elizabeth, the wardrobe gallery abutted on this
    tower, extending from it towards the keep.</p>

  <p>The curtain from Broad Arrow to Salt Tower, 156 feet, is so completely
    locked in by high buildings on each face, that its rampart walk serves
    as a gutter between the two lines of roof. It is evidently original,
    about 30 feet high, and 12 feet thick at the base. It does not appear
    to contain any cells like those in the west curtain.</p>

  <p>Salt Tower, in 1532 Julius C√¶sar‚Äôs Tower, caps the south-east angle
    of the ward. It is circular in plan, 30 feet in diameter, and 62 feet
    high. It is constructed of uncoursed rubble, with vertical lines of
    ashlar, resembling coigns, as in Beauchamp Tower.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp48" id="i_236">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_236.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">SALT TOWER.‚ÄîBASEMENT.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The ground floor, entered from the inner ward between the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
    curtains, is an irregular pentagon with five loops beneath drop-arched
    recesses. The door opens into a short passage at the north end of the
    west wall under a segmental arch, against which abuts a similar but
    half arch in the north wall, under which a small door with a drop-arch
    leads into the ascending well-stair. The arch-rings are all of good
    ashlar, but the room is not vaulted.</p>

  <p>The well-stair, which lies between the tower and its north curtain,
    at a height of about 10 feet, leads by a narrow branch to a niche
    or recess in the curtain, having a drop-arch, reinforced by a plain
    chamfered rib. This recess is open in the rear, and has a loop raking
    the outside of the tower and the cross-wall of the outer ward.</p>

  <p>The stair goes on to the first and second floor and leads. The first
    floor, also a pentagon, has on the south face a good but plain early
    Decorated stone chimney hood, with scroll moulding and plain corbels.
    In the two eastern faces are loops. In the west is a large two-light
    window, a modern restoration, and close to it a lancet opening, no
    doubt once a door leading to the south curtain. The staircase door
    enters on the north side, and close to it is a loop pointing north
    along the face of the curtain. From this floor a passage leads along
    the curtain towards the Broad Arrow Tower; from it opens a small
    garderobe.</p>

  <p>There is a third stage, and above it the battlements.</p>

  <p>Salt Tower was the meeting point of four curtains. These were the east
    and south walls of the inner ward, of equal height and thickness, and
    two walls of smaller dimensions, of which one ran east, and traversed
    the east member of the outer ward, and one ran south to Well Tower, and
    traversed the south member. Each of these had a gateway, opening into
    the space between them, and leading to the Iron Gate postern. Of the
    five loops on the ground-floor of Salt Tower, two opened north-eastward
    upon the outer ward, two south-westward upon that ward towards Cradle
    Tower, and one south-eastwards towards Galleyman Tower and the postern.</p>

  <p>Salt Tower has undergone recent and complete restoration. Its original
    features, however, seem to have been preserved.</p>

  <p>A section of the curtain between Salt and Lanthorn Tower seen against
    the wall of the former show it to have been 10 feet thick and about 20
    feet high, but the rest of it was probably removed before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span> 1532 to make
    way for the Queen‚Äôs Gallery. This curtain terminated in the Lanthorn
    Tower.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp38" id="i_237">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_237.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">SALT TOWER.‚ÄîFIRST FLOOR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The Lanthorn Tower has been long since pulled down, but its foundation
    has lately been discovered. It formed a part of the palace, and
    contained the king‚Äôs bedchamber and private closet. It was circular,
    and probably originally of the age, size, and fashion of Wakefield
    Tower. As in 1532 it was called the New Tower, it may have been rebuilt
    in that or the preceding century. It was injured by fire in 1788 and
    pulled down, with a contiguous gateway which traversed the outer ward
    at this point.</p>

  <p>Lanthorn Tower is stated in the survey of 1532 to have been 106 feet
    distant from Wakefield Tower. The actual distance occupied by Lanthorn
    Tower and its curtains, that is from Salt to Wakefield Tower, was 343
    feet.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em> is a strip of from 20 feet to 110 feet in
    breadth, which completely surrounds the inner ward, and is itself
    contained within the ditch, of which its wall forms the scarp. This
    wall, though generally, is not strictly, parallel to the inner curtain.
    Like it, its east and west faces are straight, and the north face has
    a salient angle near its centre. The river front is also bent, though
    slightly.</p>

  <p>On the south side this ward varies in breadth from 20 feet to 80 feet;
    on the east from 60 feet to 90 feet; on the west from 60 feet to 70
    feet; and on the north, the salient of which is rather bolder than that
    behind it, and a little nearer to the east end, the breadth ranges from
    90 feet to 110 feet. The lengths of the faces upon the ditch in the
    same order are, 750 feet, 580 feet, 460 feet, and 620 feet, being a
    girth of 800 yards.</p>

  <p>The wall has been so altered and strengthened by modern casemates,
    and so encrusted by buildings, that it is difficult to arrive at its
    original dimensions. The height varies from 15 feet to 20 feet inside,
    and is about 12 feet more to the bottom of the present ditch. The usual
    thickness is about 6 feet. On the river front the wall was only 10 feet
    high, and apparently only of moderate thickness.</p>

  <p>The north-east and north-west angles are capped by drum bastions, parts
    of circles of about 80 feet diameter. They are called Brass Mount and
    Legge‚Äôs Mount, probably from cavaliers once upon them. Legge‚Äôs Mount
    has the lesser projection, and seems to be solid. The lower part of
    its exterior wall looks as old as the adjacent curtains, but the upper
    part is new, and contains a casemate pierced for six guns. Brass Mount,
    that towards Little Tower Hill, is pierced by a well-stair from above
    and a cross gallery below.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> This leads from a door in the gorge to the
    middle of a circular gallery, vaulted in brick, which envelopes the
    bastion and has numerous loops for musketry, and others altered to suit
    small cannon. This gallery is probably an addition of the Tudor period,
    excavated within the old retaining walls. The salient between these two
    mounts has recently been capped by the north bastion, an additional
    and perfectly new work, being two-thirds of a circle of about 60
    feet diameter, with flattened sides, and containing three tiers of
    casemates, each pierced for five guns.</p>

  <p>The only regular towers of the outer ward are upon the south front,
    where the ditch is narrow and the palace buildings were most exposed.
    These are five, Develin, Well, Cradle, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs, and Byward Tower.</p>

  <p>Develin Tower, in 4 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> ‚ÄúGalighmaies Tower,‚Äù when no cart or
    dray was to come before it into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs unless the brethren
    paid a fine to the constable, was, in 1549, Galleyman, and in 1641,
    Iron Gate Tower. Until recently it was a powder-magazine, and not to be
    entered with a light. These conditions are not favourable to the study
    of its interior. It is a long rectangular tower, 18 feet by 32 feet,
    and built wholly in the ditch, one end being applied to the face of
    the curtain, so that it projects like a buttress from the south end of
    the east curtain, while its south side is a prolongation of the river
    front. The exterior has been partially cased, but it is evidently old,
    and in substance as originally built. Its basement is solid, but about
    10 feet above the ditch is a line of loops on the north and south, or
    two longer faces. There has been an upper story, the walls of which
    remain, but seem later than the lower. At this level, in the east face,
    is the outline of a door, which, if a postern, opened 20 feet above the
    ditch. The view of 1597 shows a double wall, probably an embattled dam
    serving as a bridge, extending from this tower across the ditch, and
    crowned on the counterscarp by a small work, called the ‚ÄúIron Gate.‚Äù If
    this drawing be correct, the roadway was through the basement chamber,
    and the upper floor led to the rampart of the wall. This gate led into
    the precinct of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs. The tower is probably the work of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and connected with an original dam for keeping up the water
    of the ditch. Forty feet west of Develin is Well Tower.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp46" id="i_239a">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_239a.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">WELL TOWER.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Well Tower, also rectangular, forms a part of the curtain, and has a
    projection into the ditch 10 feet by 16 feet wide. Its basement, below
    the present level of the inner ward, and scarcely above the water level
    of the ditch, contains a chamber, 14 feet by 10 feet, vaulted at a high
    pitch in two unequal bays, the north the larger, parted by a transverse
    rib. Each bay is vaulted in four cells, with four hip-ribs meeting in
    a plain mitred joint. There is a half or wall-rib in the gable of each
    cell. The ribs are 7¬Ω inches broad by 6¬æ inches deep, with a plain
    chamfer, and spring from four corner and two intermediate circular bell
    corbels, the tops of which are 3 feet 4 inches from the floor. The
    height of the chamber is 11 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> 6 inches. There are four loops, one
    pointing northwards into the ward, and the rest opening towards the
    ditch. All are under drop arches. In the west side is a door of 3 feet,
    opening in a drop-arched recess, which may have led into a mural cell
    in the curtain, or have been an entrance from the ward. On the east
    side a rectangular appendage, entered by a square-headed door, contains
    a well-stair of 6 feet 3 inches diameter, looped upon the inner face
    of the curtain and the ditch. This stair leads to an upper room on the
    rampart level, not vaulted, 15 feet by 10 feet, looped to the field and
    upon the face of the west curtain. In its north wall an original door,
    2 feet 3 inches wide, opens on the rampart. The second floor is modern.
    Well Tower is a good example of the early English style.</p>

  <p>Well Tower stands due south of Salt Tower, and a short curtain, with a
    gateway, connected them. Part of it remains, 12 feet high and 6 feet
    thick, pierced with loops at the ground level, and embattled against an
    attack on the east. This rampart was reached from Well Tower, and did
    not communicate with Salt Tower. A similar cross curtain connected Salt
    Tower with the outer ward wall westward. This also was looped, had a
    central gate, and was em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>battled for defence from a south attack. These
    two curtains thus enclosed the approach to the Iron Gate postern, and
    prevented either part of the outer ward from being entered by surprise.
    These arrangements are evidently as early as the time of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    and are shown in the view of 1597.</p>

  <p>Cradle Tower comes next west, at 118 feet distant. It stands on the
    outer wall, and projects 9 feet into the ditch, with a breadth of 16
    feet. It is a gatehouse, and though of small dimension very complete in
    its design, and of excellent construction. It stood nearly in front of
    the bye-gate of the royal quarter, and allowed a direct passage thence
    to the quay.</p>

    <div class="caption">CRADLE TOWER,<br />WINDOW.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It is in plan T-shaped, the portal running through the main limb,
    which projects into the ditch, and the lateral wings, each containing
    a lodge, forming a gorge or main front of 26 feet width, and flanked
    by two diagonal buttresses, which cap the angles and project into
    the ward. Between these is the doorway, and on each side of it a
    small lancet window, cinquefoil-headed. One of these windows is quite
    unaltered.</p>

  <p>The doorway is 7 feet 2 inches broad, with a drop arch and light
    chamfer moulding. Two feet in is a portcullis groove, succeeded by a
    doorway of 5 feet opening, of which the valves move inwards. The wall
    is 4 feet 7 inches thick. The passage is a chamber of two squares, 7
    feet broad, and 12 feet 6 inches high. It is vaulted in two equal bays,
    parted by a transverse rib. Each bay has four hip-ribs, and a straight
    rib takes the crown line of each vaulting cell, so that eight ribs
    meet in the centre of each bay, the point of junction being a hollow
    circle. There is besides a wall-rib in each gable. The rib parting
    the two bays, and the longitudinal rib, have a plain mitred junction.
    The rib and circle-mouldings are the same. They are light and bold,
    5 inches broad and 7 inches deep. The base of the rib has a hollow
    chamfer, and its apex is an ogee. The ribs spring from four corner and
    two intermediate corbels, the tops of which are 7 feet from the ground.
    These are octagonal and embattled. The bracket below is much defaced.</p>

  <p>The doorway in the south end, of 4 feet 6 inches opening, had gates
    opening inwards, and outside them is a second portcullis groove.</p>

  <p>The lodges open from the central passage close to the ward entrance,
    by doors, 2 feet 10 inches wide, one of which has the remains of the
    cusps of a cinquefoil in the head. They are 12 feet broad by 8 feet
    9 inches long and 12 feet high, having the small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span> windows already
    noticed towards the ward. They are hip-vaulted in chalk, with four
    cells, having four ribs 7 inches broad by 7 inches deep, springing from
    corbels, now knocked off, but the tops of which were 7 feet above the
    floor. There are no wall ribs. The portal arches of the main passage
    are drop in recesses, of which one is so low as to be nearly, and the
    other is quite, segmental. The vault-arches are equilateral, or nearly
    so.</p>

  <p>On each side of the part of this tower that projects into the ditch,
    on the outside, is a recess, on the west face 4 feet 6 inches, and on
    the east face 3 feet broad, and 1 foot 4 inches deep. Possibly these
    were the shoots of garderobes from the upper floor and battlements, now
    removed. On each side, at the old water level, is a half-arch admitting
    the water of the ditch below the drawbridge or cradle.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the curtain, close west of this tower, is a well-stair, leading from
    the west lodge to the roof.</p>

  <p>The superstructure of Cradle Tower is said to have formed a part of the
    palace quarter, and the view of 1597 shows it as a water-gate, with
    a square turret on its west flank, where was the supposed staircase.
    It shows also, west of this, a considerable tower extending across
    the ward, here very narrow, to the Lanthorn Tower, and which no doubt
    contained the Lanthorn Gate.</p>

  <p>The details of Cradle Tower are rather Decorated than early English;
    and if, as is historically probable, it be the work of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, it
    must be late in his reign, and was perhaps completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> by his son. Owing
    to the cumbrous character of the sluices and gates of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs
    Tower, state prisoners were sometimes admitted by this gate, then
    fitted with a cradle or drawbridge.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Tower, better known from its ancient function as Traitors‚Äô
    Gate, is the water-gate of the Tower, and also contained and commanded
    the communication between the Thames and the main ditch. It is, in
    fact, a barbican, and a very singular one, placed astride upon the
    ditch, here 40 feet broad, and perforated by a passage leading from the
    river. It stands considerably west of the south front, being in advance
    of the Bloody Tower 30 feet, the breadth, at this point, of the outer
    ward.</p>

  <p>The quay, in front of this tower, is traversed by a channel, 28 feet
    broad and 13 feet 6 inches deep, partly arched over and newly lined
    with granite, which opens from the Thames, through an archway 21 feet
    broad, into a rectangular basin or pool, 66 feet by 40 feet, and 18
    feet deep, lined and paved with stone, and containing, when the gates
    are opened, about 8 feet of water at high water. A flight of steps
    from the water, on the inner or north side of this basin, landed the
    prisoner within 30 feet of the gateway of the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The tower proper is placed above the outer 18 feet of this basin, but
    its side walls are prolonged backwards, so that both the front and
    sides of the basin are protected. The south wall, 9 feet thick, is
    pierced below by a low-browed water portal, already mentioned, beneath
    a drop arch, ribbed and chamfered. Between the ribs is a groove, 6
    inches broad, for an iron sluice or portcullis, worked in the building
    above; and in the jambs are two holes, 6 inches diameter, lined with
    iron, for the passage of a chain. Within this, on the inner face of the
    portal, were folding gates opening inwards.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp48" id="i_242">

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_242.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">DETAIL OF RING STONES.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Seventeen feet within this outer wall the basin is crossed by an arch,
    supporting a light wall of brick and timber, which was the rear wall
    of the tower. This arch is a very remarkable piece of construction. It
    springs from two half-octagonal piers, and is segmental, of 61 feet
    span and 15¬Ω feet rise. The voussoirs form two ribs, and the inner
    one is composed of seventy-five stones, united by a simple joggle or
    rebate. The rectangular tower, which thus rises from the walls of the
    outer half of the basin, is 86 feet east and west by 18 feet north and
    south, and capped at its two Thames-ward angles by light cylindrical
    turrets, three-quarters engaged, and rising above the parapet of the
    tower. The side walls, prolonged backwards an additional 30 feet,
    terminate in two square turrets, which occupy the northern angles, and
    also rise above the battlements.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

  <p>Two doors on the north faces of these turrets, on the ground level,
    open into a mural gallery in each wall, looped on one face towards the
    ditch and on the other towards the basin. These galleries communicate
    with the southern turrets, and are continued within the south wall,
    having each two loops towards the Thames and two towards the basin.
    They do not meet, being stopped by the jambs of the sluice-gate. They
    were also used to receive the slack of the chain when drawn up.</p>

  <p>The floor of the tower, which is above the level of these galleries,
    contained the machinery for lifting the sluice, which must have been
    heavy. The walls of this floor are also pierced with loops, and contain
    two garderobes. In the river-front are two early Decorated windows,
    of two lights each. The two upper chambers in the south turrets open
    into this floor, which is reached by a winding stair in the north-east
    turret, and by an exterior stone stair in the north-west turret.</p>

  <div class="figright illowp50" id="i_243">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_243.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">ST. THOMAS‚ÄôS TOWER.‚ÄîPISCINA.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The four chambers in the two cylindrical turrets are of excellent
    design and delicate workmanship, as may be seen from the plate in the
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Vetusta Monumenta</span>.‚Äù They are in plan octagons, having slender columns,
    with high bases and bell caps, all cylindrical, and slightly engaged,
    in each angle, from each of which springs a light chamfered rib,
    meeting in a plain joint at the centre. There are thus eight cells,
    each with a lancet gable, supported by two half-ribs. Three of the
    faces have windows or loops, and another is occupied by the door. In
    the lower rooms the loops have chamfered recesses beneath drop arches.
    In the upper, the loops are larger, but still square-headed, and their
    recesses have an arch-rib with a hollow chamfer. The south-east upper
    chamber was an oratory. The window-sills on each side the east windows
    are Purbeck slabs, hollowed into bowls,‚Äîon the south for a piscina, on
    the north for holy water. Both slabs projected, and have been broken
    off when the walls were wainscoted.</p>

  <p>There is a second floor, reached by a well-stair in the square turrets,
    which ascend further to the roof, but it contains nothing of interest.
    The well-stair in the north-east turret leads to a door that opens on
    the north face, 20 feet from the ground, and which opened outwards,
    and was barred on the outside. The meaning of this is only explicable
    on the supposition that a bridge, or perhaps an embattled cross-wall,
    connected this door with the corresponding opening in Wakefield Tower,
    18 feet distant. By this means a person leaving <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Tower,
    and barring the door behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> him, would reach Wakefield Tower, and
    therefore the palace, and cut off pursuit. In the second floor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Thomas‚Äôs Tower is another door, above and similar to the first, which
    in like manner communicated with the top floor of Wakefield Tower; so
    that either there were two drawbridges, or a wall pierced by a mural
    gallery at 20 feet high, and with a rampart walk at its summit.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Tower was, until lately, occupied by a water-engine,
    to the great injury of its walls. The upper rooms were cut up into
    lodgings by means of wainscot and lath and plaster. All has lately been
    cleared out, and the tower restored in good taste.</p>

  <p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Tower is attributed, and no doubt justly, to Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>;
    but, although the octagon chambers have an early English aspect, the
    grand arch, the staircase doors, and the windows towards the river
    are decidedly Decorated, though probably early in that style. If,
    therefore, this tower be of one date, it must be very late in the reign
    of Henry, but more probably it was completed and the grand arch turned
    in that of his son. The material is a rag-stone laid in uncoursed
    rubble masonry, like Beauchamp and Salt Towers, with ashlar dressings.
    The pool below was extensively repaired by Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> There is some
    reason to suppose that this was the tower that fell twice while being
    built.</p>

  <p>The curtain along this front is original, though capped and patched in
    modern times. It seems to have been about 20 feet high above the water,
    and from 12 feet to 14 feet on the inner side. In parts it was 12 feet
    thick; but the addition of brick casements in Tudor times, to enable
    the ramparts to carry cannon, prevents an accurate examination. It is
    no doubt the work of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> From <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs to Byward Tower is
    160 feet.</p>

  <p>Byward Tower is the great gatehouse of the outer ward, and is placed
    upon the scarp of the west ditch, at its junction with the south ditch.
    It is in plan rectangular, 50 feet broad by 24 feet deep, and its two
    outward angles are capped by drum towers, 23 feet diameter, one quarter
    engaged, which rise out of the moat. Between them is a curtain of 14
    feet, pierced by the main entrance. The towers, below the roadway, are
    solid; above it they are of three stages, and 49 feet high to the crest
    of the parapet, which, with most of the casing, is modern.</p>

  <p>The portal opens from the bridge by a low drop arch, 12 feet broad and
    12 feet high, reduced by two deep chamfers to 10 feet opening, followed
    by a broad jamb, in which are loop openings from the lodges. This is
    succeeded by a 6-inch portcullis groove, with a chase of 16 inches
    in the vault, to allow of the passage of a heavy wooden grate. Then
    follows a heavy rib, pierced with three round holes, which slightly
    converge, and are probably for the beams of a stockade, supposing the
    gates to be forced; and behind is a rebate with hinges for the valves
    of a door, opening inwards. The middle portion of the portal, which
    begins here, has a flat timber roof, 18 feet high. In it is a second
    portcullis groove, and the doors of the warders‚Äô lodges. Finally is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
    the inner archway, without jambs, but with a bold triple rib forming
    the arch.</p>

  <p>The south lodge door enters a lobby, 8 feet by 4 feet, vaulted in
    chalk, with a southern loop raking the postern. A pointed door on the
    left or east face opens into a garderobe, with a loop to the east, now
    closed. Opposite, a short passage, also vaulted, and with a cross rib,
    leads into the south or warders‚Äô lodge.</p>

  <p>This is an octagon, 15 feet 9 inches from face to face. In each angle
    is a slender octagonal pier, engaged on a face and two half-faces, with
    a sort of bell-cap and stilted base, both octagonal. From each pier
    spring a main rib and two half-ribs. The former meet in the centre in a
    plain joint; the latter form lancet arches at the gable of each cell.
    All are narrow and plainly chamfered. Of the eight vaulting cells the
    ridge lines are horizontal, and have no ribs. The ribs and piers are of
    freestone, the vaults of chalk. From the floor to the pier caps is 6
    feet 11 inches. The total height is 17 feet.</p>

    <div class="caption">BYWARD TOWER AND POSTERN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In each of the faces is a recess. That on the north-east is the
    entrance. The south-east is occupied by a fireplace, no doubt
    representing an original one; The other six are looped.</p>

  <p>The north lodge is entered through a lobby, 7 feet 9 inches square,
    and 15 feet high, vaulted in four cells, with four slender chamfered
    hip-ribs, springing from octangular corbels, one at each angle. There
    is no boss. Each cell has a profile half-rib in its gable.</p>

  <p>In the east side is a long two-light window beneath a segmental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
    recess, which seems original. This window, and the proportions and
    general elegance of this chamber, point to its possible use as an
    oratory. Those who entered the Tower might well need to be met by
    spiritual support on the threshold.</p>

  <p>In its north wall is a small lancet doorway, leading to a well-stair,
    but probably always closed. A west door leads through a short passage
    into the lodge, now a police barrack. This lodge resembles closely
    that on the south side, save that the east recess is closed up, and
    the fireplace, the brackets of which are original, occupies the
    north-east face. The upper part of this chamber, towards the ditch,
    has been pierced, probably for musketry, so as to command the approach
    from Tower Street. In the north-east angle of this gatehouse is a
    well-stair, entered by a separate door from the east and outer side.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp83" id="i_246">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_246.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">BYWARD TOWER.‚ÄîFIRST FLOOR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The first floor contains two large octagonal chambers in the towers.
    The staircase opens into one of these in the north-east angle, and a
    chamber 8 feet square occupies the south-east angle. The rear wall
    between these two turrets is wanting, so that this gatehouse, with its
    portcullis chamber, was intended to be open in the rear, or was closed,
    as now, by a lath-and-plaster brattice. There was a small window to the
    west, over the entrance-gate, looking on the bridge.</p>

  <p>The arrangements of the second floor are still more simple. The
    staircase remains, and the two octagon chambers, but the small
    south-east chamber is wanting. The rear is open.</p>

  <p>At the battlement level the staircase and its turret cease. There is
    now nothing above the parapet.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>

  <div class="figright illowp47" id="i_247">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_247.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>In the rear of and attached to the south-east part of this gatehouse
    is a low tower, of later date, intended to cover a postern bridge,
    traversing the south ditch, and dropping on the quay. The tower is
    rectangular in plan, 14 feet broad and 29 feet long, besides an acute
    salient of 12 feet more, which projects into the south ditch, and
    prevents it from being raked.</p>

  <p>It is pierced north and south by a portal 6 feet 9 inches broad, which
    commences by a square cell, vaulted, with a cross and longitudinal rib,
    chamfered, and pierced at the intersection by an octagonal cavity. Two
    door jambs then reduce the opening by a foot, and between them, in the
    vault, is a hole 9 inches diameter, apparently intended for a chain
    which passed out over the rib of the further door, and worked, still
    within the tower, a light bridge, the recess for which is seen outside
    the door. The chamber here widens by 3 feet, to allow space for those
    defending the east wall. When this bridge was down, a way was opened to
    a door in the west wall, outside which is a platform, whence a second
    bridge dropped southwards across the ditch. The upper story of this
    postern tower was one large chamber for working the inner bridge. A
    door leads from it upon the rampart walk of the east curtain. Above
    this were the battlements of the postern, two stages below that of the
    contiguous tower. In the Tudor reigns these buildings were encumbered
    with additions in brick, timber, and plaster, which still remain, and
    much obscure the original details. This postern tower is Perpendicular,
    perhaps the work of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></p>

  <p>Besides the bulwarks and towers just described, the inner ward was
    strengthened against surprise by several cross walls and gates,
    breaking it up into independent sections. One of these gates crossed
    from Bell to Byward Tower, and another, it is said, crossed north
    of Beauchamp Tower. There were walls with gates across the ward, on
    either side of Traitors‚Äô Gate, so that prisoners could be brought in
    by water and led across into the Bloody Tower gate, without any chance
    of rescue in the outer ward, and indeed without being seen. Another
    gateway of a stronger description, and with towers, extended from
    Lanthorn to near Cradle Tower; and another also, already mentioned,
    opened in the small curtain between Salt and Well Tower. There was at
    least one more gateway in the short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> curtain east from Salt Tower. The
    ward, between all these gates, must have been intended to be open; but,
    at least since the Tudor reigns, it has been encumbered with private
    houses. Here the operations of the Mint were carried on with much
    inconvenience; and the north and west limbs of the ward still bear the
    name of Mint Street, and the east limb, of Irish Mint Street.</p>

  <p>The curtain or scarp wall of this ward was, no doubt, the work of Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and much of the wall is still original. In the west wall, near
    Byward, below a modern battery of two guns, are six loops, probably
    old, but lighting modern casemates, and beneath each an air-hole.
    Also, on the north front, close west of the new bastion in the wall,
    is a pointed arched door, long closed up, but probably an original
    water-gate. West of this also is an original loop, no doubt marking the
    place of a mural chamber not now accessible.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp68" id="i_248">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_248.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">MIDDLE TOWER.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The modern additions to this curtain consist in a line of casemates,
    storehouses, canteens, magazines, and workshops, built against and
    concealing its inner face, and giving a rampart or platform of 30 feet
    width.</p>

  <p>This exterior wall has been built with great care on a broad and deep
    foundation, since it shows no sign of settlement, though built in what,
    until recently, was a deep and muddy ditch. At one part indeed, close
    south of Brass Mount, it has been strengthened by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> three very clumsy
    buttresses of 12 feet in breadth and 22 feet projection. One covers
    the internal angle of the bastion; the next is about 40 feet distant;
    and the third, at about the same space, is in fact a rectangular mural
    tower resembling Galleyman, and contains a small chamber having two
    loops on each of its three free faces. Its parapet is new, and pierced
    for two guns.</p>

  <p>Middle Tower is the outwork of Byward Tower, and a barbican covering
    the landward entrance to the fortress. It stands on the counterscarp
    of the ditch, at the outer end of the bridge, and was originally
    enveloped by a special ditch of its own, a loop from the main ditch of
    the place, filled up in the eighteenth century. In design and execution
    it resembles closely Byward Tower, though rather smaller, its breadth
    being 40 feet, and its height 30 feet from the roadway. It is evidently
    of the date of Byward, and like it was open at the rear. It also has
    been cased with Portland stone. Its portal has a double portcullis,
    gateway, vertical holes, side loops and lodges, and its central part
    is ceiled with timber. In neither tower is there now any trace of
    a drawbridge. The lodges are tolerably perfect; the stair in the
    north-east angle is in use, and corresponds to the Byward oratory; and
    in the south-east turret is a lobby and a garderobe, and above these
    a chamber 7 feet by 8 feet 6 inches, and again on the leads another
    chamber 7 feet 4 inches by 10 feet 10 inches.</p>

    <div class="caption">MIDDLE TOWER.‚ÄîFIRST FLOOR.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Between the two gatehouses the ditch is traversed by a stone bridge,
    130 feet long, and at the narrowest 20 feet wide. As the towers are
    not precisely opposite, the line of the bridge is broken by a slight
    zigzag. In the centre appears to have been an opening of 20 feet, now a
    stone arch, once the place of a drawbridge, as shown in old drawings.</p>

  <p>The Quay does not appear to have had any permanent parapet wall,
    which indeed would have interfered with its uses. It was sufficiently
    commanded by the defences of the outer ward. It was probably the work
    of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, in the twelfth of whose reign it is first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> mentioned,
    and called ‚Äú<span lang="la">Kaia Regis</span>‚Äù; and John de Crumbwell, custos 8‚Äì9 Edward
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, had then an order for 300 alder poles from Windsor forest for
    repairing it. The quay is in length about 1,130 feet, that being the
    full frontage of the Tower.</p>

  <p><em>The Ditch.</em>‚ÄîThis, by far the most formidable of the defences of
    the Tower, varies in breadth from 100 feet on the east to 110 feet on
    the north, and 120 feet on the west or City side. Along the south or
    river front it is only 40 feet broad, probably because on that side it
    was covered by the wharf, the narrow limits of which did not permit any
    great force of assailants to be drawn up upon it; besides which the
    tower covering Traitors‚Äô Gate, and the two small postern bridges which
    it was convenient to have towards the wharf and river, did not allow
    any great breadth of ditch.</p>

  <p>The ditch was not only broad, but of great depth, so that when filled
    to the level of high water it was scarcely to be passed, and indeed
    when the water was low, the mud which accumulated there, and which
    made it of late years an unhealthy nuisance, must have been quite as
    formidable as a defence. Nevertheless, care was taken to cleanse it,
    and the ‚ÄúLiber Albus‚Äù informs us that, in the reign of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    the penalty for bathing in the Tower fosse, or in the Thames near the
    Tower, was death! (<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> <abbr title="1">i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="49">xlix</abbr>.) Its exterior circuit is computed
    at 3,156 feet.</p>

  <p>Also, from the great height of the ground to the west and north, the
    counterscarp is so very high as to be in itself a considerable obstacle
    to crossing the ditch, although, no doubt, this was in other respects
    advantageous to besiegers. Besides the main bridge, the ditch was
    crossed by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Tower and the dam between Galleyman and Iron
    Gate, all of which served to hold up the water. There were also the
    posterns of Iron Gate, Byward, and Cradle Tower.</p>

  <p>No doubt the Conqueror‚Äôs ditch, even when deepened by Longchamp, was
    fed by the Thames; and the water rose and fell with the tide. The
    intervention of the wharf and the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs sluice-gate were devised
    to make the water in the ditch independent of the tide, and thus add
    materially to the strength of the defences. The ditch was drained and
    its bottom raised and levelled by the Duke of Wellington during his
    constabulate. There are seen in the modern brick revetment of the
    counterscarp a number of walled-up arches, resembling sewer-mouths,
    which appear to have been intended to facilitate the mining the glacis
    in the event of a siege.</p>

  <p>The outwork in advance of Middle Tower, though its ditch is filled
    up, and its other buildings removed, is still indicated by a line of
    stockades, which contain the ticket-office and a small engine-house.
    Here stood the Lion Tower, and the Royal Menagerie; and this whole
    <i lang="fr">t√™te-de-pont</i> was further protected by a smaller tower and
    drawbridge of its own, shown in some of the early drawings.</p>

  <p>Lions were a part of the royal state, and lodged in the Tower bulwark,
    in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> The Emperor Frederick, in 1235, sent Henry
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> three leopards; and, in 1252, Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> received a white bear
    from Norway, for whose sustenance, with his keeper, the sheriffs of
    London provided fourpence daily, with a muzzle and iron chain, to keep
    him when ‚Äú<span lang="la">extra aquam</span>,‚Äù and a stout cord to hold him when a-fishing
    in the Thames. In 1254, Louis of France sent the king an elephant.
    He was brought from Sandwich to the Tower, where the sheriffs were
    to build him a strong and suitable house, 40 feet by 20 feet, and to
    support him and his keeper. Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> and Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> kept lions here.
    At a time when the allowance for an esquire was one penny per day, a
    lion had a quarter of mutton and three-halfpence for the keeper; and,
    afterwards, sixpence was the lion‚Äôs allowance; the same for a leopard,
    and three-halfpence for the keeper. In 16 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, there were a
    lion and a lioness, a leopard, and two cat-lions. In 1543, the Duke
    of Najara saw here four large and fierce lions, and two leopards. The
    menagerie was finally closed about the year 1830. Its establishment on
    this particular spot was probably due to Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>The whole outward space was, in 1597, called the Bulwark, and sometimes
    the Spur-yard.</p>

  <h3>HISTORY.</h3>

  <p>Having decided to build an ‚Äú<span lang="la">Arx Palatina</span>,‚Äù and having some years‚Äô
    experience of the value of the proposed site as a temporary camp, the
    Conqueror at length determined to erect a regular castle, and entrusted
    the work to Gundulf, a monk of Bec, who, in 1077, soon after his
    arrival in England, was consecrated Bishop of Rochester.</p>

  <p>Gundulf brought with him from Normandy some reputation as an architect,
    which vocation he pursued in this country. Rochester Keep, that strong
    but graceful tower, placed so judiciously above the ancient passage
    of the Medway, and long attributed to the bishop, is now known to be
    of later date; and the only existing buildings, besides the White
    Tower, which can safely be attributed to him, are the north tower of
    Rochester Cathedral, parts of the old crypt, and perhaps a small part
    of its west front; also the very perfect and unaltered shell of Malling
    Keep, known as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard‚Äôs Tower; possibly the broad, massive tower
    of the adjacent church, and, it may be, the Norman portions of that of
    Dartford. These remains, however, the White Tower, and the testimony of
    many generations, may be regarded as sufficient for the confirmation of
    his fame.</p>

  <p>A direct evidence for the employment of Gundulf upon the White Tower
    is afforded by the ‚ÄúTextus Roffensis,‚Äù written about 1143, or within
    eighty years of the Conquest, and printed by Hearne. This record
    preserves incidentally the fact that Gundulf, while so employed, lodged
    at the house of Eadmer Anh≈ìnde, a burgess of London, and a donor to the
    bishop‚Äôs church at Rochester, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> he directed his body and that of
    his wife to be buried, and to have an annual obit.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>Gundulf was appointed bishop in 1077, and probably his first attention
    was given to his cathedral, so that it is supposed he did not commence
    the Tower until 1078, up to which time the ground was occupied by
    certain temporary defences.</p>

  <p>Gundulf reached the age of eighty-four, and lived till 1108, that
    is, through the reigns of the Conqueror and Rufus, and to the ninth
    of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>; it is, therefore, certain that he lived to see the keep
    completed, perhaps by Rufus; and he most probably made some progress in
    the walls of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, and the buildings of the palace, and
    perhaps of the Wakefield Tower.</p>

  <p>The fortress designed by the Conqueror no doubt included very much of
    the space within the present walls. Less would scarcely suffice to
    contain a citadel, a palace, and an arsenal; and the liberties were
    evidently of no greater area than was necessary.</p>

  <p>The west boundary line runs but a few yards outside the counterscarp
    of the ditch, and includes only what may be called a narrow glacis,
    and nothing of the open space or esplanade usually reserved around a
    fortress. It is, however, probable that no permanent exterior defences
    were executed by the Conqueror, and that those first commenced were
    the curtains from the Wakefield to the present Broad Arrow Tower, and
    the cross walls of the Wardrobe Gallery and Cold Harbour, which, with
    the keep, included the space set apart for the palace. This was for
    many centuries known as the inner ward; and the Wardrobe and Lanthorn
    Towers and those of the Cold Harbour Gatehouse, all now destroyed, are
    represented in the reign of Elizabeth as cylindrical, and resembling
    in design the Wakefield Tower, which is late Norman. It is, therefore,
    probable that the old inner or palace ward was first completed.</p>

  <p>The rest of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, forming what is now known as the
    inner ward, could not, however, have been much later. According to the
    ‚ÄúAnglo-Saxon Chronicle,‚Äù Gervase, and Le Livere, Rufus was, in 1097,
    building about the Tower a wall of sufficient magnitude, with the
    new hall at Westminster, to be the cause of heavy taxation, and the
    subject of general discontent, augmented, no doubt, by the impregnable
    character of his work. The existing curtain of the inner ward, being
    from 9 feet to 12 feet thick, from 39 feet to 40 feet <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>high, and of
    sound but rude masonry, cannot be later than John, by which reign
    the wall of Rufus could not have fallen into decay. It is far more
    probable, and quite consistent with the dimensions and character of the
    work, that this was the actual wall commenced by Rufus, and upon which
    he was employed in 1097.</p>

  <p>Bell Tower, indeed, which seems to bond into the curtain, and the base
    of which presents masonry very like that of Wakefield, is octagonal,
    and its vaulting can scarcely be earlier than John; but Devereux Tower,
    which is cylindrical outside, and has round-headed recesses in its
    polygonal basement chamber, may be as old as Wakefield, and therefore
    in substance the work of Rufus. The vaulting is later, but both may
    have been, as at Wakefield, taken down to the first floor at a later
    period, to which the vaulting may belong. Beauchamp, Bowyer, and all
    the other towers on this wall are evidently later insertions; but the
    wall itself, where it remains, as on the west and part of the east and
    south fronts, is of a very early character, and not unlike the wall
    of John at Corfe and the earlier one attributed to Robert Consul at
    Cardiff.</p>

  <p>Most of the chroniclers record a violent storm that swept over London
    towards the close of the eleventh century. Le Livere dates it Friday,
    27th October, and Malmesbury, 28th November, 1091, and says it unroofed
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary-le-Bow, and destroyed 600 houses, as houses then were.</p>

  <p>Stowe adds that the White Tower was damaged ‚Äúby tempest and winde sore
    shaken,‚Äù and that it was repaired by Rufus and Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>; but he gives
    no authority for this statement, which the extreme solidity of the
    building renders very improbable. The outworks, however, both wall and
    towers, if in course of construction, with scaffolding up, might very
    well have suffered severely.</p>

  <p>The Tower, therefore, of the close of the reign of Rufus, and of those
    of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> and Stephen, was probably composed of the White Tower with
    a palace ward upon its south-east side, and a wall, probably that we
    now see, and certainly along its general course, including what is now
    known as the inner ward. No doubt there was a ditch, but probably not a
    very formidable one.</p>

  <p>Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Durham, and the faithful and rapacious
    minister of Rufus,‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">pacitator Ranulphus, vir pessimus,</span>‚Äù‚Äîby his severe
    exactions greatly promoted the works of the Tower. Singularly enough,
    he is the first person known to have been imprisoned there. Henry, on
    his accession, and by the advice of his council, 15th August, 1100,
    shut up Flambard in the Tower. Palgrave says he was lodged in the
    uppermost or council-chamber of the White Tower, under the custody
    of Walter de Magnaville, the hereditary constable. Probably his
    imprisonment was only intended to satisfy the popular cry, for two
    shillings, at that time a considerable sum, was allowed for his daily
    sustenance. He employed it, as is said, in feasting his keepers; and
    having received a rope in a flagon, took advantage of their drunken
    state to let himself down from the window of the south gallery, on
    the night of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> 4th February, 1101, taking his pastoral staff with
    him. The rope proved too short for the descent of 65 feet, and he was
    injured by a fall, but he escaped in safety to Normandy, and, as is
    well known, lived to recover his see of Durham, where he completed the
    cathedral, added a moat to the Palatine castle, founded Norham on the
    Tweed, built Framwell Gate bridge, and endowed the hospital of Kepyer.
    The Tower was probably from the first a state prison, for in 1106 the
    Earl of Mortaigne, taken with Robert Duke of Normandy by Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, was,
    says Eadmer, shut up there. The Pipe Roll of 21 Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> records ‚Äú¬£17.
    0<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, inoperatione Turris Lond.‚Äù</p>

  <p>In the time of Stephen the Tower was regarded as impregnable. Geoffrey,
    grandson of Geoffrey de Magnaville, the companion of the Conqueror, and
    the third hereditary constable, was created Earl of Essex by the king,
    who in 1140 kept Whitsun in the Tower. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Eodem anno, 1140, in Pentecoste
    resedit Rex Londini√¶ in Turri, tantum modo Episcopo Sagiensi presente:
    c√¶teri vel fastidierunt, vel timuerunt venire</span>.‚Äù [R. de Hoveden.] The
    new earl proved false, and shifted his allegiance to the empress, who,
    by charter in 1141, confirmed him in his earldom and the constableship.</p>

  <p>When the power of Maud declined, the citizens, to whom Geoffrey was
    as odious as his fortress, laid siege to it. Their efforts were so
    unsuccessful that on one occasion the earl made a raid as far as
    Fulham, and captured the bishop.</p>

  <p>In 1143 the earl trusted himself in the royal presence at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban‚Äôs,
    depending on the king‚Äôs word. The temptation to obtain the Tower was
    too great,‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">magis ex necessitate quam honestate</span>,‚Äù‚Äîhe was detained,
    and the Tower was his ransom. Stephen held it until 1153, close upon
    the conclusion of his reign, when, by the Treaty of Winchester, he
    gave it up to Richard de Lacy, the Justiciary, who was to hold it
    until Stephen‚Äôs death, when it was to pass to Henry, which accordingly
    was done in 1154. It is clear, therefore, that at that time the
    fortifications of the Tower were both complete and strong; and this, in
    the absence of a wet ditch, which it will be shown did not then exist,
    could scarcely be the case with walls of inferior strength to those now
    seen.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> is said to have placed Becket in command of the Tower, the
    government of which had ceased to be hereditary. But there is no proof
    of this, or that Becket repaired it; though at a later period, indeed,
    one of his demands, as archbishop, was the custody of Rochester Castle
    and the Tower. By this time ‚ÄúLondon‚Äôs lasting shame‚Äù had attained its
    gloomy reputation, and Fitz-Stephen describes the ‚Äú<span lang="la">Arx Palatina</span>‚Äù as
    ‚Äúgreat and strong, with encircling walls rising from a deep foundation,
    and built with mortar tempered with the blood of beasts.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The Pipe Rolls of this reign contain frequent entries of large sums
    issued for the repair of the king‚Äôs houses in the Tower, his chapel,
    and his gaol. In 2 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was paid for carrying the king‚Äôs
    breastplates to the Tower; but the regular series of accounts does
    not begin until 13 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and ends with 34. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> entries for
    Westminster and the Tower are also much mixed up together, though
    sometimes distinct. Thus in 13 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> the king‚Äôs houses in the
    two places and the queen‚Äôs chamber cost ¬£64, and, in 19 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    ¬£60 was paid for the repairs of the Tower and of the houses in it.
    In the preceding year the king‚Äôs houses in the bailey of the Tower
    cost ¬£21. In 20 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Alnod, the engineer, had ¬£6. 13<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for
    works at the Tower, and afterwards 100<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> Similar payments continually
    occur, sometimes for lead for the repairs of the chapel, sometimes for
    carriage of timber and planks, sometimes for the kitchen, the gateways
    of the gaol, the repairs of the houses, and sometimes for the Tower
    itself.</p>

  <p>The necessity for each expenditure is often certified to by the view
    of two officers, Edward Blund and William Magnus; the works were
    executed by the engineer Alnod; and the brief, authorising payment, was
    signed either by the king himself, or by Richard de Lucy or Ranulph de
    Glanville, no doubt as justiciars. The sums paid varied from 1<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> to
    ¬£64, and the total for the thirteen years of which the rolls remain, is
    ¬£215. 15<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> and 50 marks.</p>

  <p>When in February, 1190, C≈ìur de Lion departed from Normandy to the
    East, he placed the Tower in charge of William Longchamp, Bishop of
    Ely and Chancellor, sharing the power of chief justiciary with Pudsey,
    Bishop of Durham, to which the Pope added the office of legate. These
    combined honours seem to have turned Longchamp‚Äôs head. Always of
    intense activity of character, he spurned all colleagues in his power.
    His first act on reaching England seems to have been to provide for his
    personal security by girdling the Tower with a wall and deep ditch,
    which he proposed to fill from the Thames. In this, however, he failed,
    after spending a large sum of money.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>The wall was probably that of the outer ward, which would be necessary
    to retain the banks of the ditch, and the commencement of that which
    still remains. The failure could scarcely be in the admission of the
    Thames, which required only a certain depth of excavation, but was
    rather in the retaining it full at low tide, so as to make it really a
    wet ditch. This important object was attained in a later reign, by a
    new and ingenious arrangement. In his excavations, Longchamp encroached
    upon land belonging to Trinity Church, East Smithfield, and took a mill
    from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs Hospital. These trespasses were much complained
    of, and seem to have been the same on account of which a compensating
    rent-charge was afterwards paid by Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> There is still a small
    burial-ground on the east glacis of the Tower, which is said to be a
    part of the land then taken. There was also an earlier trespass on
    Church lands by the constables, for Geoffrey, Earl of Essex, took by
    force from Trinity Priory, in East Smithfield, land near the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>Tower to
    make a vineyard, which was not restored to that church until towards
    1137.</p>

  <p>Longchamp, whose patent directed the lieges to obey him, even as
    the king himself, commenced by imprisoning Bishop Pudsey, his rival
    justiciar. His unpopularity was fostered by Prince John, who headed
    a party against him, and took occasion of his ill-treatment of the
    Archbishop of York to summon Longchamp to appear before a council at
    Loddon, by Reading. Longchamp refused compliance, but retired before
    John‚Äôs superior force to London, where he entered the Tower with all
    his train, pressed by the citizens, who took part against him and
    blockaded the fortress by land and water. John, with many barons and
    bishops, reached London on the 8th of October, 1191, and held a council
    in the chapter-house, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul‚Äôs Churchyard, on the 9th, summoning
    the people by the sound of the bell. Here the Archbishop of Rouen
    and William Mareschal produced Richard‚Äôs declaration from Messina,
    limiting the independent powers of the justiciar, whom the meeting
    then deposed by acclamation. Four earls and as many bishops conveyed
    this sentence to Longchamp, who fell senseless upon the floor. On the
    following morning, at an early hour, John assembled an immense host in
    East Smithfield, a great green plain near the Tower, and summoned the
    justiciar to a parley. He surrendered upon terms at once, far too soon
    for his credit, and marched out with his followers and household stuff
    to Bermondsey, whence with much difficulty and through various dangers
    he reached Normandy.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The Archbishop of Rouen then took charge of the
    Tower; but the chancellor, as is well known, retained or resumed his
    office, and on November 21, 1194, the well-known William Fitz-Osbert
    impleaded his brother Richard in the Curia Regis (‚ÄúRot. Cur. Regis.‚Äù
    xi., xvii.) for having said, ‚ÄúIn recompense for the money taken from
    me by the chancellor within the Tower of London, I would lay out forty
    marks to purchase a chain in which to hang both king and chancellor.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Various entries in the Pipe Rolls of Richard show that the usual
    repairs of the Tower, and especially of the royal apartments therein,
    still went on. Unfortunately, although the sums are given, the detail
    of their outlay is very generally omitted.</p>

  <p>The entries extend from the first to the tenth of the reign, and relate
    to nine years, during which about ¬£610 was spent on the Tower and its
    houses. The recipient was sometimes Wm. Puincell, the constable; at
    others, Jordan de Turri, Richard le Duc, John Fitz-Erlecum, and others.
    Sometimes under the king‚Äôs brief, sometimes the chancellor‚Äôs. In one
    year, lime cost ¬£46. 9<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> In the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>first of the king, 50 marcs were
    spent upon the ‚ÄúRoyal Chapel in the Tower.‚Äù The ditches are mentioned 5
    Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p>Longchamp‚Äôs reign was so short that it is difficult to understand how
    he managed to execute as much as he undoubtedly did. The rolls of the
    early years of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> do not indeed show above one or two hundred
    pounds of outlay, but the chancellor had the command of other funds;
    and one cause of his excessive unpopularity with the citizens was the
    avidity with which he took upon himself to tax them.</p>

  <p>Prince John, when he succeeded to the throne in 1199, was not
    inattentive to the wants of the Tower. In his two first years, Elias,
    the engineer, was employed upon the king‚Äôs houses and works, and
    similar entries appear in the fifth, tenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
    years. In the sixteenth the sum was considerable‚Äî¬£117. 15<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; and in
    the seventeenth the charge, ¬£12, is for building the mud or ‚Äúclay wall
    between the Tower [precinct] and city,‚Äù which wall is often referred to
    in later surveys. On the whole, the Pipe Rolls of the reign are scanty
    as regards the Tower, but they are in some degree replaced by entries
    upon the Mise, Close, and Patent Rolls, which show that it was kept up
    as a royal residence, and that the king occasionally stayed there.</p>

  <p>In 1209 and 1210, 9<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> were given in alms to one hundred poor there;
    and in the latter year Osmund, a knight bound for Poictou, received
    a gift of ten marcs, and, to buy a horse, a hundred shillings from
    the king. This was given in the ‚ÄúChurch of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter at the Tower of
    London‚Äù; and is the earliest known mention of that building. Here also,
    on Sunday, the morrow of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Philip and Jacob, Steffan, the messenger
    of the emperor, received half a marc on his return to his lord, and
    other payments were made here.</p>

  <p>In 1212 the Archdeacon of Durham and Philip de Ulecote are ordered to
    send in all haste to London thirty carratas (cartloads) of lead for
    covering the Tower; and, in 1213, among orders for repairs for the
    castles of Rochester, Canterbury, and Guildford, is mention of carriage
    of timber and ‚Äúbusca‚Äù (faggots), for the works of the Castle of Dover
    and the Tower of London. It was about this time that the city ditch
    was deepened, and widened to a breadth of 200 feet. In 1215, Henry de
    Nevill was to supply ten oaks for the works at the Tower, five from
    within Havering Park and five from outside it.</p>

  <p>It was also in 1215 that the barons seized upon London, and that the
    Tower was given over to be held by the Archbishop of Canterbury until
    Assumption Day as a pledge for the king‚Äôs performance of certain
    engagements. The rights of either party to the Tower were suspended,
    and the king was not to reinforce the garrison. The great charter
    was signed 15th June. The barons, however, continued virtually in
    possession until the arrival of the Dauphin, to whom it was given up in
    1216, and by him held until he left the kingdom.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Hardy, in his valuable ‚ÄúItinerary of King John,‚Äù shows that he
    executed instruments at the Tower upon seventy-two days during his
    reign of seventeen years and a half. In 1204, he was there 28‚Äì30th
    January, 27‚Äì30th May, 2‚Äì3rd November. In 1205, 28th April and 13‚Äì16th
    August. In 1207, 2nd July. In 1208, 21st January, 10th, 19th‚Äì21st
    February. In 1209, 9th October. In 1210, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 19th
    February, 2nd May, and 27th October. In 1211, 1‚Äì3rd and 18th April. In
    1212, 18‚Äì20th May; 2‚Äì4th June; and 20‚Äì22nd September. In 1213, 16th and
    17th April; and 21‚Äì23rd, 26‚Äì29th December. In 1214, 2‚Äì5th, 12th, 13th
    January; and 29th‚Äì31st October. In 1215, 1‚Äì6th and 14‚Äì18th March; and
    19th April.</p>

  <p>As Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> has usually been regarded as the builder of much of
    the Tower as it now stands, and did undoubtedly execute considerable
    works there, it will be convenient here to examine into the probable
    condition of the fortress at the time of his accession.</p>

  <p>It has been shown, from structural evidence, that the Wakefield Tower,
    and probably the shell of Devereux Tower, and perhaps that of Bell
    Tower, are at least as old as the reign of John; and that there is
    great reason to regard the original Wardrobe and Lanthorn Tower and its
    curtains, and the Cold Harbour wall and Gate towers, and the contained
    palace, all now destroyed, as of the age of Wakefield Tower. Also, as
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter‚Äôs Church existed in the reign of John, and was ‚Äú<span lang="la">apud Turrim</span>,‚Äù
    or within the walls, these, between the Bell and Devereux Towers, where
    they pass close to the church, were also then existing. We should
    thus have the wall of <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the present inner ward, from
    Lanthorn Tower to Wakefield, Bell, and Devereux Towers, as the extent
    of the fortress on the south and west fronts. The north curtain, now
    mostly destroyed, seems to have been of the same date as is the east
    curtain, though probably some of the towers upon these‚Äîthe Bowyer,
    Jewel, Constable‚Äôs Broad Arrow, and Salt‚Äîare of later reigns.</p>

  <p>Then there was the ditch deepened and widened by Longchamp, with a wall
    on the line of that of the present outer ward. The quay and the river
    front, from Iron Gate to Byward, with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Tower, were not then
    constructed, nor was the Bloody or Gatehouse Tower. Probably the inner
    ward wall abutted direct upon the river shore.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> began his reign in 1216, and the attention of his prudent
    guardian, the ‚Äú<span lang="la">rector regis et regni</span>,‚Äù seems at once to have been
    turned to the Tower. In 1217 the sheriff of Essex and Herts is to pay
    to Nicholas Rowland ¬£10 for repairs of the king‚Äôs houses in the Tower;
    to which is added, in the next year, ¬£8. 9<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> and ¬£19. 9<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>,
    also to the same Nicholas. About the same time (2 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
    is paid for the transporting the king‚Äôs breastplates (loricas) to the
    Tower; 3 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, ¬£9. 13<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> is paid for repairs of the king‚Äôs
    hall, and the broken wall of the chamber; and the houses within the
    ballium of the Tower are to be repaired upon the view and testimony of
    certain lawful men; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> (5 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>), at a cost of 17<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>, four tables
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">ad mensam</span>,‚Äù for the use of the king, are to be placed in the Tower.
    The year before this (4 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>), the Pleas of the Crown, in the
    City of London, were heard before the justices in the Tower.</p>

  <p>In 1221, Peter, Bishop of Winchester, was to have ¬£11. 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> for the
    repairs of the king‚Äôs house, executed when the Tower was in his hands;
    and Richard de Munfitchet was to supply Stephen de Segrave, the
    constable, with timber of the best quality, from Havering, for planks
    for the completion of the ‚Äú<span lang="la">jarellum</span>‚Äù [jarolium, barrier] about the Tower.</p>

  <p>The king was there in person in these years, for his expenses for five
    days there, in 1219, were ¬£19. 1<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7¬º<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; and next year 100 marcs were
    paid towards his expenses there during Lent, and 200 marcs repaid to
    Pandulph the legate, then Bishop of Norfolk, advanced on the same
    account. In that year, also, the king had at the Tower a supply of
    10 lampreys, part of a debt due from the city of Gloucester to his
    lamprey-loving father.</p>

  <p>1221 was a busy year at the Tower. Many military implements and
    stores, and seven cartloads of prisoners, were brought in by Alex. de
    Sabrichtsworth, from Biham, the surrendered castle of Wm. de Fortibus,
    at a cost of 5<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> Henry was there 28th February and 5th March. The
    next year also included several accounts connected with the siege of
    Biham. The works were also continued. Stephen de Segrave had 30 marcs
    for the repairs of the ballium wall; and Peter de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward, with
    Andrew Buckerell, the chamberlain, 70 marcs of the amerciament levied
    on the London vintners, for works at the Tower. 8th December, 1221,
    Nicholas Mazon, who made the well, had five marcs. Timber and materials
    were sent in by the sheriffs of Essex and Bucks.</p>

  <p>In 1222, 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was paid for the repairs of the wardrobe in the king‚Äôs
    chamber at the Tower, and for making a chimney in the same, and 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>
    for a robe for Robert le Champenies, clerk of the works. Chimneys in
    those days were not always flues within the wall, but shafts of wood,
    or other temporary material, placed against it.</p>

  <p>7 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1222‚Äì3. The Close Roll credits Richard Benger and Thomas
    Lamberde with ¬£10. 12<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, which they paid by the king‚Äôs precept to
    Peter of Poictou and his companions, keepers of the works of the ‚ÄúNew
    Turrelle,‚Äù or turret, of the Tower of London, for the work of the said
    turret. Mr. Hugo applies this entry to the Bell Tower; it may, with
    equal or more probability, be applied to the superstructure of the
    Wakefield Tower.</p>

  <p>Pandulph the legate appears to have been custos in 1223, and in that
    capacity entertained at the Tower John de Brienne, titular King of
    Jerusalem, and the Grand Master of the Hospital, then in England to
    promote a crusade. In this year the king acknowledged the receipt of
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">unum austurcum</span>‚Äù (a goshawk) at the Tower. John de Monmouth and the
    vendors of ‚Äú<span lang="la">cableicium</span>,‚Äù or underwood, in Dean Forest, out of the
    king‚Äôs gift thereof to the Priory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span> Llantony, are to find 40 chevrons
    for the repairs of the Tower; and the sheriffs of London are to restore
    the ‚Äú<span lang="la">palum coram postico</span>,‚Äù or ‚Äúgallows before the postern‚Äù of the
    Tower, and the gallows outside of the Tower. 26th May, 1224, the king‚Äôs
    crown was lodged in the Tower by the treasurer.</p>

  <p>The Pipe Roll of 9 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1224‚Äì5, contains various entries
    relating to the Tower:‚Äî34<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was paid for ‚Äú<span lang="la">pro husciis de cute et de
    feltrio</span> [housings of hide and of felt or compressed wool, or gambeson],
    <span lang="la">ad balistas Regis, etc., cooperiendas,</span>‚Äù for housing the king‚Äôs balist√¶
    which are in the Tower; and for iron and steel (ascero) delivered to
    the constable for the works there, 2 marcs. Also for charcoal (carbo),
    for the king‚Äôs smiths‚Äô work there, 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; and to Thomas de Blunvill,
    50 marcs for the king‚Äôs works; and for charcoal for making the king‚Äôs
    ‚Äúquarells‚Äù (cross-bow bolts), <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, by ‚ÄúThomas Faber‚Äù (the smith), in
    the Tower, 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; and for mending the king‚Äôs houses in the Tower,
    29<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7¬º<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

  <p>In the tenth year, besides the sum of 42<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> and 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, for charcoal
    for works, Thos. de Blunvill received the value of ¬£12. 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> in six
    caretatis, or cartloads, of lead, ‚Äú<span lang="la">ad novam turrellam turris Lond:
    cooperiendam,</span>‚Äù and four loads, value ¬£8. 0<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 19<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, for the same
    purpose; so that the lead on the roof of the new turret cost at least
    ¬£20. 4<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> At this time Blunvill had ¬£40 per annum as custos.</p>

  <p>In the two next years, 1226‚Äì8, 96<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was paid for charcoal, Thomas
    Faber being the master-workman; and Henry Fitz-Alchi had 100 marcs for
    the Tower works. For the three following years the rolls are silent.
    In 1232, Hubert de Burgh had a fee of ¬£50 per annum as constable; and
    in 16 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 113<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was paid for iron, steel, and charcoal,
    purchased and delivered to Roger le Smith, in the Tower, for making
    quarells and other work.</p>

  <p>In 1233, the Tower became the enforced residence of Isabel, the king‚Äôs
    sister, until her marriage with the Emperor Frederick, in 1235; and
    28th April, 1236, Henry adopted the unusual course of adjourning a
    council of his magnates to the Tower. The assembly, as was to be
    expected, was but thinly attended, and in consequence was further
    adjourned to Westminster.</p>

  <p>On 2nd March, 1238, 22 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the Liberate Roll contains an entry,
    which is repeated as follows in the corresponding Pipe Roll:‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">Et in
    cameris Regis in turri Lond: reparandis et chimenee Camere Regine
    perficiendis et uno spiro de bordis bono et decenti faciendo inter
    cameram et capellam nove turrelle eiusdem turris prope aulam Regis
    versus tamisiam xvi<i>li.</i> iij<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i> per breve,
    etc.</span>‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd for repairing the king‚Äôs chamber in the Tower of London, and
    completing the chimney in the queen‚Äôs chamber, and for making a good
    and fitting spur [partition] of boards between the chamber and chapel
    of the new turret of the same Tower, near the King‚Äôs Hall, towards the
    Thames, ¬£16. 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, by brief, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>‚Äù This is one of the few notices of
    repairs the precise place of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> can be identified. The new turret
    is undoubtedly the first floor of the Wakefield Tower, known to have
    been near the King‚Äôs Hall and towards the Thames, and of which the
    chapel, or oratory, still remains.</p>

  <p>In the same 1238, 23rd November, the Liberate Roll shows the king to
    have ordered the constable to cause the walls of the queen‚Äôs chamber,
    ‚Äúwhich is within our chamber at the Tower, to be whitewashed and
    pointed,‚Äù and within the pointings to be painted with flowers; ‚Äúand
    to cause the drain of the privy chamber to be made in the fashion of
    a hollow column, as our beloved servant John of Ely shall more fully
    declare to thee.‚Äù</p>

  <p>In the 24 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> is a charge of ¬£30. 16<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for purchasing and
    conveying to the Tower ‚Äú<span lang="la">una navata</span>,‚Äù or shipload, of marble, and four
    shiploads of Purbeck marble, for the works of the Tower. It is only in
    the cills of the two windows of the sacrarium of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Tower
    that Purbeck stone has been discovered in position; but much of this
    material remains upon the rampart walks and in other places in the
    fortress, whither, no doubt, much of it was imported in this reign,
    and especially at this time, for the works then in progress, which in
    1239 were considerable. A good deal of Kentish rag was used, and both
    Ryegate and Caen stone for ashlar. Often the material for building
    was brought a great distance. Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> used Egremont
    stone for Windsor. Matt. Paris describes the treasury as well filled,
    which unusual condition, and looming troubles of the realm, probably
    disposed Henry to add to the security of his stronghold. The new works
    were unpopular in the city, the citizens fearing, and not without
    reason, that they would be employed in some way to their detriment. On
    this subject they addressed a remonstrance to the king, who assured
    them that the works were not intended to be employed to their injury.
    ‚ÄúI only,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúimitate my brother, reputed a wiser man than I, in
    rebuilding my castles.‚Äù</p>

  <p>It seems that a fine gateway and a wall were completed, but fell
    suddenly on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George‚Äôs night (23rd April), 1240, and were immediately
    rebuilt by the king. A year later, in 1241, the same structures, or
    as much of them as had been rebuilt, again fell down, and this time
    the citizens found a supernatural reason for the event. On the night
    of the second fall, says Matt. Paris, a certain grave and reverend
    priest saw a robed archbishop, cross in hand, who gazed sternly upon
    the walls with which the king was then girdling the tower, and striking
    them sharply, asked, ‚ÄúWhy build ye these?‚Äù on which the newly-built
    work fell as though shattered by an earthquake. The priest, too alarmed
    to accost the prelate, addressed himself to the shade of an attendant
    clerk, ‚ÄúWho, then, is the archbishop?‚Äù ‚Äú<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas the Martyr,‚Äù was the
    answer, ‚Äúby birth a citizen, who resents these works, undertaken in
    scorn and to the prejudice of the citizens, and destroys them beyond
    the power of restoration.‚Äù On which the priest remarked, ‚ÄúWhat outlay
    and labour of the hands he has destroyed!‚Äù ‚ÄúHad it been,‚Äù said the
    clerk, ‚Äúsimply that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> starving and needy artificers thence promised
    themselves food, it had been tolerable; but seeing that the works were
    undertaken, not for the defence of the realm, but to the hurt of the
    citizens, even had not <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas destroyed them, they had been swept
    away utterly by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmund, his successor.‚Äù</p>

  <p>That night the priest told his tale, and next morning the walls about
    the tower, built at a charge of about 12,000 marcs, were seen upon the
    ground, to the surprise, but by no means to the grief, of the citizens,
    to whom they had been as a thorn in the eye. Notwithstanding the
    prediction of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas, the works were at once resumed, and this time
    with complete success.</p>

  <p>No doubt the wall and gateway were <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs Water-gate and the
    adjacent curtain along the south face of the fortress, and upon the
    bank of the river, where the wet ground and the treacherous character
    of the London clay, exposed more or less in the old city ditch and that
    of Longchamp, would render the archbishop‚Äôs task an easy one. The story
    may be taken to show that in 1239‚Äì40 Henry was engaged in extensive
    works about the Tower, including the outer ward wall and tower, the
    quay, and the present ditch; and the present works show that they
    were of sufficient importance to be replaced, at whatever cost, when
    destroyed by an accident. Probably the architect learned experience by
    the event; for it is remarkable that no serious mark of settlement from
    defective foundation has been observed either in the work of the outer
    ward or in any other part of the fortress, and this is more singular
    because part of the masonry must have traversed the line of the old
    city ditch. This stability is probably due to the great breadth of the
    foundations, and to the fact that the fortress contains no underground
    chambers, the towers below the ground level, and sometimes far above
    it, being solid.</p>

  <p>The resumption of the works on the wall and west gateway did not lead
    to the neglect of the royal residence within. 24th February, 1240, 24
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the king, according to the Liberate Roll, thus addressed
    the custos of the works:‚Äî‚ÄúWe command you to cause the chamber of the
    queen, in the aforesaid tower, to be wainscotted without delay, and to
    be thoroughly whitened internally, and newly painted with roses; and to
    cause to be made a wall [partition] in the fashion of wainscot between
    the chamber and the wardrobe of the same, and let it be entirely
    covered externally with tile; and also cause one great chamber in the
    same tower to be entirely whitewashed and newly painted, and all the
    windows of the same chamber to be made anew with new wood and bolts and
    hinges, and to be painted with our arms, and barred with iron where
    needful. Moreover, repair and mend all the glass windows in the chapel
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist within the said tower, where necessary; and
    repair all the windows in the great chamber towards the Thames with
    new wood, with new bolts and hinges, and bar them well with iron; and
    in the corner of the same chamber make a great round turret towards
    the Thames, so that the drain of the last chamber may descend into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
    the Thames; and make a new cowl on the top of the kitchen of the great
    tower.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The Liberate Roll of the same year, January, 1240, orders ‚Äúa mantel‚Äù to
    be painted in the Tower, with a personification of Winter with a sad
    visage and miserable contortions of the body.</p>

  <p>And on the 10th December following (25 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) the keeper is
    further ordered, ‚ÄúTo repair the granary within the same tower, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>,
    and to cause all the leaden gutters of the great tower, through which
    rain-water should fall from the summit of the same tower, to be carried
    down to the ground; so that the wall of the said tower, <em>which has
    been newly whitewashed</em>, may be in no wise injured by the dropping
    of rain-water, nor be easily weakened. And make on the same tower on
    the south side, at the top, deep alures of good and strong timber,
    entirely and well covered with lead, through which people may look even
    unto the foot of the said tower, and ascend, and better defend it, if
    need should be. And also whitewash the whole chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the
    Evangelist in the same tower, and make in the same chapel three glass
    windows, one, to wit, on the north part, with a certain small figure of
    Mary holding her child; the other, on the south side, with the [subject
    of the] Trinity; and the third on the same south side, with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John
    the Apostle and Evangelist; and paint the cross and beam beyond the
    altars of the same chapel, and with good colours. And cause to be made
    and painted two fair images, where they may be best and most decently
    made in the same chapel, one of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward holding a ring and giving it
    to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Evangelist. And whitewash all the old wall around our
    aforesaid tower.‚Äù</p>

  <p>From these orders, we learn that the chapel in the White Tower was
    whitewashed, glazed, had three painted windows, and a painted beam and
    rood behind the altar, besides painted figures, no doubt in fresco, on
    the wall, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Evangelist. The great chamber
    towards the Thames, being enumerated in conjunction with the chapel,
    might be supposed to be the state-room in the White Tower; but ‚Äúthe
    great round turret towards the Thames, with the contained drain,‚Äù could
    not apply to the White Tower, nor indeed to any of the existing towers
    on the Thames front. It may have been the Lanthorn Tower.</p>

  <p>The White Tower is spoken of as newly whitewashed. This was no doubt
    intended to make good any irregularities in the masonry, for 28 Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the tower at Corfe was ordered to be pargetted with mortar where
    necessary, and the whole exterior to be whitewashed. It is not quite
    clear what were the alures, so minutely specified, on the top of the
    south front of the White Tower; probably a bretasche or hoarding, since
    no other work would enable the defenders to see the foot of the wall.
    It might have been supposed that at so great a height no extra defence
    from missiles would have been necessary, and supposing the inner ward
    to be taken, it would be from the higher ground on the north, rather
    than on the south side, that the effect of archery or warlike engines
    would be the greatest.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

  <p>In this same 25 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Peter Bacun and Richard de Fresingfeld and
    their fellows, keepers of the Tower works, had ¬£36; also ¬£24. 40<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was
    paid for twenty breastplates and twenty halbergeons, purchased for the
    defence of the Tower, and delivered to the constable. So important were
    the works at this time that an order was made that ‚Äúbefore closing the
    Exchequer the barons were to audit the accounts of the custos of the
    works of the king‚Äôs Tower of London.‚Äù In 26 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> the chaplain
    ministering in the Tower chapel had 50<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> per annum.</p>

  <p>Among the regulations in use about this time were several relating to
    the legal position of the Tower, recorded in the Liber Albus. Thus,
    when the Exchequer was closed, the mayor was to be presented at the
    Tower, and the Pleas of the City with the crown were sometimes held
    there; and when this was the case the city barons were to place their
    own ‚Äújanitors‚Äù outside the Tower gate, and the king‚Äôs janitor was to
    be on the inside. They further had an ‚Äú<span lang="la">ostiarius</span>‚Äù outside the door of
    the hall where the pleas were held, to introduce the barons, and the
    king had an ‚Äúostiarius inside.‚Äù The hall was no doubt the building
    afterwards superseded by the office of Ordnance, and the entrance to
    which is thought to have been by the modernised doorway close east of
    the Wakefield Tower.</p>

  <p>The next entry discovered is upon the Liberate Roll, 29 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    3rd December, 1244, by which the constable of the Tower is ordered
    to deliver to Edward Fitz-Otho as much lead as shall be necessary to
    execute certain specified works at Westminster. It was in this year
    that Griffith-ap-Llewelyn, in attempting to escape by a rope from his
    prison in the Tower, fell and broke his neck. Griffith was corpulent,
    and the White Tower whence he let himself down was lofty. His rope was
    composed of bed linen and the like, and broke. 30th April, the king
    publicly declares this unfortunate accident, and attributes the neglect
    to the attendants, whose duty it was to take charge of the prisoner.</p>

  <p>31 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1246‚Äì7, the constable had sixty marcs for constructing
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">quandam turrellam</span>,‚Äù a certain turret; and next year forty marcs more
    were paid for making a certain turret, a privy chamber, and other
    works. 33 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, fourteen cartloads of lead were purchased for
    ¬£32. 9<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, and delivered to Peter Blund, the constable.</p>

  <p>In 34 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> the Pipe Roll shows Edward of Westminster and the
    constable to have had sixty marcs for Tower works, and the keepers
    thirty marcs for repairing and covering the king‚Äôs houses and for lead
    for the works. Next year, 1250‚Äì1, ten marcs went for repairing and
    covering walls and turrets, and ¬£4. 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for two loads of lead for
    the same operation upon the king‚Äôs houses.</p>

  <p>37 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Adam de Lamburn, master of the Tower works, had ¬£10, and
    the keepers, also for works, ¬£30, and Adam again ¬£12, and next year the
    keepers for works fifty marcs more. 39 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1254‚Äì5, ¬£22. 20<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
    was paid for a house for the king‚Äôs elephant, 40 feet long by 20 feet
    wide. This was a present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> from the King of France, and is said by Matt.
    Paris to have been the first elephant seen north of the Alps. There
    was also paid for repairs of houses and turrets, ¬£59. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> Next
    year, ¬£52. 11<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 3<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was paid for works begun by the sheriff of the year
    preceding, and for Tower shortcomings ¬£37. 2<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 9<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; and 41 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    ¬£90. 14<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 9<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for stones for completing the already commenced Tower
    quay, and for the Great Wardrobe and other deficiencies.</p>

  <p>42 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1257‚Äì8, two sums of 101<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> and ¬£4. 12<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> were paid
    for lead gutters and other repairs; and 43 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, ¬£36. 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for
    repairs of the king‚Äôs houses, and for making a new stable and repairing
    an old one, and gutters, and a ‚Äú<span lang="la">claustura</span>,‚Äù or partition, for the same
    tower, ¬£17. 15<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

  <p>This was the year, 1258, in which, under the Provisions of Oxford,
    the barons seized the Tower and placed in it Hugh le Bigod as custos.
    There was in this year a brief,‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">In emendacionem planchicii<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> turris
    Lond: et turrella ejusdem turris versus aquam cooperienda, etc.</span>‚Äù Henry
    soon afterwards, by the permission of the pope, broke faith with his
    subjects, and regained the Tower, where he was resident in February,
    1261, and ordered 40<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> to Theodore de Castell for iron for the King‚Äôs
    Tower works, taken from him.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of the country forced the king into active measures
    for the conservation of the fortress. He spent Christmas, 1260, there
    with his queen, and employed the money at his command in completing
    the defences. Probably it was about this time that the water-gate was
    ready, and the tidal ditch converted into a wet moat. Matt. Paris
    mentions the efforts now made to strengthen the place, and how the king
    at this time invited the citizens to swear fidelity to him, and to take
    service in his army then mustering outside the city. He also again
    named the Tower as the place of meeting for a Parliament to be holden
    21st February, 1261, 45 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>The councillors did not respond to the summons. The king kept Easter
    in the fortress, whither the bailiffs of Gloucester were directed,
    18th March, to send up daily as many lampreys as they could take; and,
    17th April, the bailiffs of Waltham were to supply 60<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> worth of good
    fine bread and loaves of four for a penny, and to send them to the
    royal pantler at the Tower for the usual dole on Easter eve. Similar
    perquisitions were addressed to the bailiffs of Barking and Dartford,
    to those of Kingston and Watford, to the extent of 40<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>, and to the
    mayor and sheriffs of London to ¬£20. In all, ¬£33 worth of bread was to
    be distributed. There were also orders for 164 tunics on the part of
    the king and queen, to be delivered to the royal almoner, and 21 tunics
    on the part of the royal children; all to be distributed to the poor
    according to custom. Henry remained at the Tower till about the 20th
    April.</p>

  <p>Prince Edward returned to England in that year, but did not act <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>with
    his father, whose advisers he distrusted. The king, however, seems
    to have held the Tower, and kept Christmas of 1261 within its walls.
    Thence, leaving John Mansell in charge, he went to Dover, and so by
    Rochester to Winchester for Whitsuntide. There, however, the barons
    prepared to seize him, and he retired to the Tower, where he remained
    till October. Christmas of 1262 he again spent at the Tower.</p>

  <p>After some time passed beyond sea, and a Christmas at Canterbury, Henry
    failed to meet his enemies at Worcester, and returned, 47 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    to the Tower, where, with his queen, Prince Edward, and the King of
    the Romans, he consulted with the mayor and aldermen of London on the
    subject of de Montfort, and soon afterwards with that nobleman himself.
    One result was the placing Hugh le Despenser in charge of the Tower.
    It was in this year that the queen, leaving the Tower by water to join
    the prince at Windsor, was hooted at and pelted by the populace on the
    bridge, and forced to put back. In the same year, John Sperling, at a
    cost of ¬£7, erected a ‚Äú<span lang="la">palicium</span>,‚Äù or palisade, between the Tower and
    the city wall; and two years later he had altogether ¬£25. 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 3<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for
    covering-in the king‚Äôs houses, repairing the king‚Äôs garderobe, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

  <p>Henry was again at the Tower in 1265, after the battle of Evesham; and
    in 1268 the fortress, then commanded by Hugh Fitz-Otho, and containing
    the papal legate, Ottobon, was besieged by Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester.
    The Jews, who with their families had been harboured in the Tower,
    contributed personally to its defence. Gloucester threw up earthworks
    and attempted a blockade; but in May and June, Henry, approaching by
    Windsor and Stratford, encamped there for two months, and, throwing in
    a reinforcement, brought out the legate by the south postern towards
    the river, and established him with the army at Stratford, forcing
    Gloucester to sue for peace.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p>The hall of the Tower and other houses cost ¬£20 in repairs in 1268‚Äì9,
    and in other repairs ¬£12 in the next year; but nothing is recorded
    concerning the following and two closing years of the long reign of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>With the death of Henry and the earlier years of his son the history
    of the Tower, as a specimen of military architecture, may be said
    to decline, and its history as a state prison, if not to begin,
    to preponderate. Edward at once continued and completed the works
    commenced by his father, and probably was thus employed for ten or
    twelve years. In 1274, 2 Edward, the treasurer was to pay 200 marcs
    towards the work of the ditch, then nearly made, about the bulwark.
    This was the loop ditch surrounding the barbican, planned by Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, but no doubt then first excavated. Besides this, in 1287, the
    main ditch seems to have been under <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>enlargement, and its encroachment
    upon <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs land was valued in 1302 at 73<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> per annum. The
    clay taken out was sold by the constable to the tylers working in East
    Smithfield. In 1289, it yielded 20<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>, but had averaged ¬£7‚Äîabout ¬£100
    in our day. Bayley tells that 600 Jews were at one time imprisoned
    here by Edward, 1281‚Äì2, as clippers of the coin. On 8th October, 1303,
    the king, then at Kinloss, ordered the Abbot of Westminster and his 80
    monks to be imprisoned in the Tower, on a charge of stealing ¬£100,000
    of the royal treasure. The following mandate, of three years‚Äô later
    date, shows the form in which prisoners were committed. It relates to
    a Scottish gentleman of rank. <span lang="fr">‚ÄúMons: P: de Graham et vadletz, soient
    enveez, par bon conduyt, a Londres, et livrez au Conestable de la
    Tour illueques: et q‚Äôil les face garder en fers, en bon et sur lieu,

    voudra respondre de eux, corps pour corps; et q‚Äôil lor face trouver lor
    sustenance meanement.‚Äù</span></p>

  <p>In 1307 occurs a curious sanitary order. ‚ÄúWhereas Margaret, Queen of
    England, is about to dwell awhile in the Tower, the mayor and sheriffs,
    to prevent infection of the air, <span lang="la">‚Äòper accensionem rogorum,‚Äô</span> are to
    prohibit and punish any one ‚Äòburning pyres‚Äô or doing anything by which
    the air can be corrupted.‚Äù Dated, Carlisle, 28th June.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> was more dependent upon the Tower for personal safety than
    as a prison. His eldest daughter, hence called ‚ÄúJane de la Tour,‚Äù was
    here born. In 1312, he put the Tower in a state of defence against
    his barons; and, in 1324, shut here the two lords, Roger Mortimer of
    Wigmore and his namesake of Chirk. Their escape is described in the
    ‚ÄúOpus Chronicorum.‚Äù They were shut up ‚Äú<span lang="la">in eminentiori et arctiori loco
    Turris</span>,‚Äù which should mean the White Tower. They drugged the drink of
    their keepers, and in a stormy night escaped by breaking the wall, and
    thus reached the annexed palace kitchen, from the top of which, by a
    rope-ladder, and aided from within the walls, they reached the Thames
    and thus fled the country.</p>

  <p>Two years later, Mortimer of Wigmore returned with the queen, and took
    arms against Edward, who put the Tower in order, sending thither 100
    coats of mail (Pell Rolls, 158), and there, 20th June, he received the
    city authorities. On the 2nd October he fled, leaving his son, John of
    Eltham, in the Tower, and Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, in charge of the
    city. The citizens, as is well known, rose and beheaded the bishop, and
    next day, falling in with John de Weston, the constable, they extorted
    from him the keys, and entered the fortress. They seem, however, only
    to have freed the prisoners, turned out the officials, and appointed
    their own men, under the nominal authority of Prince John.</p>

  <p>The first years of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>‚Äôs reign were spent, perforce, in
    the Tower, until he put down Mortimer and assumed the government.
    Probably the Beauchamp and Salt Towers, and perhaps the Bowyer, were
    his work. In the ninth of his reign, by commission, dated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> Berwick,
    16th October, 1336, he ordered a survey of the defects of the Tower
    to be made, and a jury to be empanelled to declare what repairs were
    needed. This return was made without delay, and is printed by Bayley.
    It mentions the gate towards <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs, the steps and passages
    upon the wall, a chamber over the Water-gate; ‚ÄúCorande‚Äôs‚Äù Tower and ‚ÄúLe
    Moneye‚Äù Tower; the chapel of the Tower; the king and queen‚Äôs chapel;
    two turrets over the old gate, one called ‚ÄúLa Plummerye‚Äù; and the quay
    opposite the Thames, with the little postern at one end and ‚ÄúPetywales‚Äù
    at the other. Beauchamp, Bowyer, and most of the other towers are not
    named,‚Äîprobably because some were not then built, and others, the work
    of his grandfather, did not need repair. ‚ÄúLe Blanche Tour‚Äù seems not
    to be the keep, called then ‚ÄúAlta turris.‚Äù The other parts named are
    numerous, but evidently belonged to the palace ward, now destroyed.
    The result of the return was, that the Tower, next year, was put in
    order and garrisoned. The Close Roll (10 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) mentions that,
    in 1337, the sheriffs of London were to pay ¬£40 out of the farm of the
    city, to be spent on ‚Äúthe great Tower,‚Äù then in great need of repair;
    and the sheriff of Kent was to bring oak from Havering for the works.
    The sheriffs of Surrey and Sussex also had to provide ¬£20 for the same
    service.</p>

  <p>The Tower was Edward‚Äôs chief arsenal. Thither, 1337‚Äì8, the sheriffs of
    London were to send ‚Äú<span lang="la">5 millia ferri et 200 bordas de Estland [Baltic
    planks], ac centum quarter carbonum maritimorum</span>‚Äù (sea-coal), for making
    anchors for the ‚ÄúChristopher‚Äù and ‚ÄúCogge Edward,‚Äù and for certain works
    on the Tower. (‚ÄúAbb. Rot. Orig. <abbr title="2">II.</abbr>,‚Äù <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 116). Edward was at this
    time much engaged in preparing for foreign wars, and it was to the
    Tower that he returned suddenly from Tournay, towards midnight, 30th
    November, 1340, and punished the constable for negligence. Also between
    1340 and 1342 he was much at the Tower, and one of his daughters was
    born here. The records also show that the Mint had a considerable share
    of the royal attention.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hunter has shown (‚ÄúArch.,‚Äù <abbr title="32">xxxii.</abbr>, 380) that, as early as 1347,
    bills were paid for the manufacture, probably two or three years
    earlier, of ‚Äú<span lang="la">pulvis pro ingeniis</span>‚Äù; and in 1346, ‚Äú<span lang="la">ad opus ipsius Regis
    pro gunnis suis</span>,‚Äù 9 <abbr title="hundredweight">cwt.</abbr> 12 lb. of saltpetre and 886 lb. of quick
    sulphur were had; so that gunpowder was then, no doubt, manufactured in
    the Tower.</p>

  <p>About the same time the Tower received the first of a series of
    illustrious foreign prisoners of war. David, King of Scots, taken at
    Neville‚Äôs Cross, was brought here in January, 1347, and remained here
    eleven years; so late as 1357‚Äì8, ¬£2. 12<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 9<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> being paid for medicines
    supplied to him. Later, in the same year with David, came Charles of
    Blois, nephew to Philip of France; and still later John de Vienne,
    governor of Calais, and the twelve brave burgesses of that town.
    Finally, in 1350, here was lodged John, King of France, and the nobles
    taken with him, and in the same place of safety the ¬£47,171. 1<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>,
    the first instalment of his ransom.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span></p>

  <p>In 24 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1350‚Äì1, John de Alkeshull had commission to take,
    throughout the kingdom, ‚Äú<span lang="la">petram, buscam, carbones, maeremium, plumbum,
    vitrum, ferrum, et tegulam</span>‚Äù; that is, stone, wood, coal, timber, lead,
    glass, iron, and shingle, and all things needful for the king‚Äôs works
    at Westminster, Windsor, and the Tower. How these materials were
    divided is not known. Windsor probably received the chief share of them.</p>

  <p>In 1354, the king proposed to alter the constitution of the chapel of
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter ad Vincula at the Tower, and incorporate it as a college,
    with a dean and three canons, instead of a rector and chaplains. This,
    however, does not seem then to have been effected, as both Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>
    and Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> nominated a rector to the ‚ÄúFree Chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter.‚Äù
    The actual incorporation did not come to pass until the last year of
    the reign of Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> It was in 1354 proposed that the standards of
    weight and measure should be kept at the Tower; and this year the king
    ordered the city ditch to be cleansed, and prevented from overflowing
    into the Tower ditch. In Stowe‚Äôs time the filth was taken off by a
    sewer from the City ditch.</p>

  <p>Appointments of armourers, bowyers, engineers of the war-slings, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>,
    show that the store of weapons of war continued to be considerable. In
    33 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> all the bows, strings, arrows, ‚Äúhancipes [two-handed
    winches] pro balistis tendendis,‚Äù<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in the custody of W. Rotherel, in
    the Tower, are ordered to be packed in chests, quivers, butts, pipes,
    and barrels, and sent to Sandwich to cross the water with the king. In
    1360‚Äì2, various sums were spent in repairs of the king‚Äôs record-house
    in the Tower containing the Chancery Rolls: probably the Wakefield
    Tower.</p>

  <p>Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> fulfilled the usual custom of lodging a short time in
    the Tower before his coronation, that he might proceed in state to
    that ceremony through the City. Here also he took refuge during Wat
    Tyler‚Äôs rebellion, after which Arnold Brocas was paid ¬£3. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for
    repairing the door broken open by the common rebels within the Tower.
    In 1380‚Äì1, a code of regulations was drawn up for the better government
    of the place. In 1385‚Äì6, cannon were sent hence to Porchester. In 1387,
    Richard came here to escape his uncle the Duke of Gloucester, and at
    Christmas in that year he was blockaded by the rebel lords, to whom he
    gave audience within the fortress.</p>

  <p>Two years later, in 1389, it was from the Tower that the king went to
    hold a great feast and tournament in London; and here, in 1396, his
    new queen, Isabel of France, was lodged before her coronation. Here,
    finally, Richard signed his abdication in favour of Henry of Lancaster.
    No work at the Tower can positively be attributed to this reign, or the
    succeeding one of Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr></p>

  <p>It appears from the Issue Roll and the Pell Records of 1 Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>,
    that breakfast was provided at the Tower at a cost of ¬£2. 16<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for
    Thomas, Earl of Arundel, Henry le Scrop, Lord de Roos, and the Mayor
    of London, commissioners for trying traitors. This Lord <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>de Roos was
    William, seventh baron, ancestor of a late lieutenant-governor, whose
    ancestors on the male side‚Äîthe Fitzgeralds‚Äîalso frequently partook of
    the hospitality of the Tower, though in the less agreeable capacity of
    prisoners.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> revived the old glories of the prison by sending hither
    Charles, Duke of Orleans, taken at Agincourt. An illumination of the
    period, given by Lord de Ros, shows the duke to have been lodged in the
    state rooms in the White Tower, and shows also the four windows of the
    great hall, which adjoined Wakefield Tower on the east.</p>

  <p>The strong monarchs employed the Tower as a prison, the weak ones as a
    fortress; and under Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> it appears in this latter capacity. In
    1460, Lord Scales, the king‚Äôs governor, was besieged by the Earl of
    Salisbury, Lord Cobham, and Sir John Wenlock. The city men attacked
    the west front; Wenlock, from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine‚Äôs; and Cobham, with the
    artillery, from the Southwark shore, firing across the river. When
    the south ditch was cleared out and levelled in 1842‚Äì3, several round
    shot of iron and about thirty of Kentish rag stone, from 4¬Ω inches to
    10 inches, and in one case 17 inches, diameter, were found, which are
    supposed to have fallen there on this occasion.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> is reputed to have built a bulwark outside the west
    gate by the Lion Tower. In the eleventh of his reign payments were
    made for arms and ammunition for the defence and for work upon the
    fortifications of the Tower. The workmen were brought from Calais. In
    the same year money was allowed for the expenses of Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, then
    prisoner in the Tower. Richard <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, during his brief reign, pressed
    masons and bricklayers to complete certain repairs at the Tower.</p>

  <p>Probably the walls and towers were allowed to decay by Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>;
    for Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, in 1532, ordered a survey to be made with a view to
    a general repair, which was executed shortly afterwards. The repairs
    were very considerable, and the masonry was executed in Caen stone
    backed with brick, and, unfortunately, very much of the Tower seems
    to have been so faced or cased, and otherwise very seriously altered.
    The survey is very minute, and throws light upon much that is now
    destroyed. Mention is made of ‚ÄúBurbedge Tower,‚Äù on the wall between
    Bowyer and Brick Towers, evidently the present Brick Tower, the then
    ‚ÄúBrick‚Äù being the present Martin Tower. ‚Äú<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin‚Äôs‚Äù Tower was then
    the outer gate, now ‚ÄúMiddle‚Äù Tower. The present Salt Tower was then
    Julius C√¶sar‚Äôs Tower, and the old Lanthorn Tower was called New Tower.
    Wakefield is called ‚Äúthe tower where the king‚Äôs records lie,‚Äù and
    ‚ÄúBloody‚Äù was then Garden Tower. ‚ÄúByward‚Äù was ‚Äúthe Wardyng Gate.‚Äù Two
    timber bridges, evidently drawbridges, were to be renewed at the west
    entrance. The keep was then, as now, the White Tower, distinguished by
    its four turrets.</p>

  <p>Byward Tower had a narrow escape in 1548. A Frenchman who lodged in
    ‚Äúthe round bulwark called the Warden Gate, between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> west gate and
    the postern, or drawbridge,‚Äù blew up the bulwark, and himself, with
    gunpowder. It was rebuilt. There was also in the reign of Edward <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>
    a drawbridge between Iron and Traitors‚Äô Gate, evidently Cradle Tower.
    This was used for the reception of great prisoners, the strong iron
    gate (<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas‚Äôs) being almost out of use.</p>

  <p>The buildings of the palace probably had fallen into decay in the
    reign of Elizabeth, by whom, or by James, the Great Hall was removed.
    Other buildings followed. Many were destroyed by Cromwell and many by
    James <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> to make room for a new Ordnance office, and the remains of
    the Lanthorn Tower were taken down late in the last century. The White
    Tower underwent a final disfigurement at the hands of Sir C. Wren in
    1663, who Italianised its openings, cased a part of its exterior,
    and rebuilt two of its turrets. Sir Christopher‚Äôs work may be traced
    throughout the fortress by the Portland stone introduced by him, just
    as the work of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> is indicated by the use of brickwork and
    rough-cast, and the practice of closing the joints of the masonry with
    chips and spawls of flint. The ditch was cleansed in 1663, and the quay
    refaced.</p>

  <p>The Tower, at the commencement of the present century, was an
    extraordinary jumble of ancient and later buildings, the towers and
    walls being almost completely encrusted by the small official dwellings
    by which the area was closely occupied. A great fire in 1841 removed
    the unsightly armoury of James <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and William <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> on the north of the
    inner ward, but the authorities at the time were not ripe for a fire.
    The armoury was replaced by a painfully-durable Tudor barrack, and the
    repairs and additions were made with little reference to the character
    of the fortress. More recently, the general improvement in public taste
    has made its way even into the Tower. Mr. Salvin was employed upon it
    until his death, and more recently many modern buildings have been
    removed, many ancient foundations laid open, and very extensive repairs
    and some absolutely necessary restorations have been effected, under
    the skilful and very judicious care of Sergeant-Major Andrews.</p>

  <p>Thus much of the Tower as an ancient and very curious military
    structure, which, throughout the additions, alterations, and
    subtractions of eight centuries, still preserves the character of an
    early fortress, and very much of original and peculiar work. It may
    be that, in some respects, the Tower cannot be compared with others
    of the great feudal castles of England. It does not, like Dover and
    Bambro‚Äô, stand on the edge of a lofty cliff, commanding an equal
    expanse of land and water. It has not the solitary grandeur of Corfe,
    nor its old associations with the Anglo-Saxon times. It does not, like
    Conway, Caernarvon, Beaumaris, and Harlech, bear the impress of one
    mind in its design, of one hand in its execution; neither can it boast
    the rich surroundings of Ludlow, Warwick, or Kenilworth, nor the proud
    pre-eminence of Windsor, the present residence of the sovereign, the
    seat of the oldest and most illustrious order of Christian chivalry,
    the cynosure of four fair counties, rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> amidst a rich mantle of
    forest verdure diversified with the silver windings of the Thames, and
    the venerable walls and courts of Eton.</p>

  <p>The Tower of London can put forth none of these various claims to
    our attention, but it is not the less the most interesting fortress
    in Britain. It is the work of the great Norman conqueror of England,
    founded by the founder of her monarchy. It is the citadel of the
    metropolis of Britain, and was long the most secure residence of her
    greatest race of kings. Here they deposited the treasure of the empire
    and the jewels and regalia of their crown. Here they secured the
    persons of their prisoners, and minted and stored up their coin. Here
    the courts of law and of exchequer were not unfrequently held; here
    the most valuable records were preserved; and here were fabricated
    and preserved long-bow and cross-bow, sword, lance, and pike, armour
    of proof, balist√¶, scorpions, and catapults, then the artillery and
    munitions of feudal war. Here, too, as these older machines were laid
    aside, was first manufactured that ‚Äúsubtle grain,‚Äù that ‚Äú<span lang="la">pulvis ad
    faciendum le crak</span>,‚Äù and these ‚Äúgonnys and bombards of war,‚Äù which were
    to revolutionise the military art, until they themselves should be
    superseded by later inventions, of which the ancient keep is still the
    grand storehouse and armoury of the country.</p>

  <p>But the Tower has memories surpassing even its associations with
    the military glories of the state. It has been the prison and the
    scaffold of not a few of the best and bravest of English blood. Percy
    and Mortimer, Hastings and Clinton, Neville and Beauchamp, Arundel,
    Devereux, Stafford, and Howard,‚Äîthose ‚Äúold stocks who so long withstood
    the waves and weathers of time,‚Äù‚Äîhave here found a grave. Here the
    great house of Plantagenet flourished and was cut down. Here England‚Äôs
    Elizabeth learned the uses of adversity; and here Raleigh solaced his
    confinement with the composition of that History which has made his
    name great in letters as in naval enterprise.</p>

  <p>Here, too, captive within these walls, and through these gates led
    to death, were More and Fisher, martyrs for the ancient, and Anne
    Askew for the purer, faith; Lady Jane Grey, the most innocent and
    accomplished of victims; Strafford and Laud, firm for the old tyranny;
    Sir John Elliot, who died broken-hearted in the prison for the new
    liberty.</p>

  <p>No other fortress, no bastile in France, no bargello in Italy, no
    prison-castle in Spain or Germany, is so deeply associated with the
    history of its nation, or with the progress of civil and religious liberty.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="LUDLOW_CASTLE_SHROPSHIRE">LUDLOW CASTLE, SHROPSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">LUDLOW CASTLE is the glory of the middle marches of Wales, and first
    in place among the many military structures by which the great county
    of Salop has been adorned and defended. It is a noble specimen of
    military, palatial, and even ecclesiastical architecture, of high
    antiquity and of historic fame. It is probably without rival in Britain
    for the sylvan beauty of its position, in which wood and water, and
    meadows of wide expanse and rare fertility, are combined with rugged
    and lofty crags, of which the walls and towers seem to form a component
    part, so natural are the tints of their lichens, so thick the foliage,
    and so close the embrace of their ivy. Nor are its associations with
    the past unworthy of so bright a scene. Here, in the age of chivalry,
    the Lacys and the Mortimers achieved many of those feats of arms which
    filled the border counties with their renown. Here Stephen exercised
    his great personal strength on behalf of the heir of the Scottish
    throne, who was about to be hauled up into the beleaguered castle
    by a somewhat uncouth and unusual engine of war; and against these
    formidable walls the wild tribes of Wales flung themselves for two
    centuries, only to fall back, like the surge of the sea, broken and
    scattered. The Castle of Ludlow was the early residence of Edward
    <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, and the cradle of his infant sons; and here died Prince Arthur,
    the elder brother of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> In rather later times within these
    walls sat that celebrated Council of Wales of which Henry Sydney was
    long the President, and which the chambers of the building, ruined and
    roofless as they are, show to have been lodged so splendidly. Here,
    too, towards the close of that brilliant but vicious provincial court,
    the attractions of which were felt even by the austere Baxter, Butler
    wrote a part of his immortal satire, and the masque of <em>Comus</em> was
    first given to the world. The history of Ludlow, however, both castle
    and borough, has already been written,‚Äîfor its early period, with
    scrupulous accuracy by Mr. Eyton, and at greater length, and down to a
    later period by Mr. Wright; and the object of the present paper is only
    to describe the particulars of the castle, or at least of the military
    part of it, and thus to supply an admitted deficiency.</p>

  <p>The Castle of Ludlow crowns a rocky promontory which projects at a
    height of above a hundred feet over the union of the Corve with the
    Teme. Eastwards, and in its immediate rear, and rather lower than the
    castle, but much above the adjacent plain, stands the grand cruciform
    church with its lofty central tower, and about and below it the quaint
    old town. To the north, far below the walls, the Corve and the Teme
    are seen to wind across the meads which they fertilise, while to the
    west opens the deep and narrow ravine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> down which their combined waters
    flow to the distant Severn. Formerly, when the mead was a morass, and
    the ravine choked with fallen timber and the irregularities of an
    obstructed drainage, the defence on these two most exposed quarters
    must have been peculiarly strong, and an addition, by no means
    unnecessary, to the security of the march.</p>

  <p>The promontory is in plan rather more than a right angle, and its two
    sides are protected by nature. At a radius of about two hundred feet
    from the angle a broad and deep ditch has been excavated from cliff to
    cliff, and thus, as at Norham, encloses an area in plan a quadrant,
    though not of extreme regularity. This forms the middle ward of the
    castle, and the inner ward is carved out of it in its south-western
    corner. The outer ward lies to the east and south, covering the middle
    ward on its townward side. To form it, the northern and western sides
    were projected along the cliffs about another two hundred feet, and
    were connected by a second ditch, now filled up, and which formed the
    outer defence of the place upon its weakest but least exposed sides.
    This ditch, the line of which may be inferred from its curtain-wall,
    was not exactly concentric with the inner ditch, but lay in two
    irregular lines nearly at right angles to each other, so that the whole
    area of the castle is in form roughly rectangular, and about 130 yards
    east and west by 150 yards north and south; including, therefore, about
    four acres.</p>

  <p>The town also was walled, and its walls abutted upon the castle, which
    thus, as usual under such circumstances, though provided with its own
    defences, formed a part of the general <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. The town-wall
    may still be traced from the south-western angle of the castle, above
    the river, to the south gatehouse, which, though encrusted with late
    building, and disfigured in the manner characteristic of the last and
    preceding centuries, stills shows a portcullis-groove, and an archway
    which seems to be in the early English style, and probably of the time
    of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>The castle is composed of an inner, middle, and outer ward. The inner
    ward occupies the south-west angle of the middle ward, and is roughly
    rectangular, 32 yards east and west by 16 yards north and south. The
    south wall divides it from the outer ward, and its western is part of
    the general <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. Its two other walls divide it from the
    middle ward. This ward has three towers, the keep, the bakehouse, and
    the postern, at its south-east, south-west, and north-west angles. In
    it is the well.</p>

  <p>The middle ward contains a pile of Tudor buildings over and about the
    gateway, built against the south curtain, which is of Norman date. They
    abut also upon the keep. Along the north curtain is the grand mass of
    the state and domestic buildings, composed of the buttery tower, the
    hall, the state and private rooms, and the square tower, which occupies
    the north-east angle of the ward. This group forms the grand feature of
    the castle, being of mixed Norman and Decorated date, of great height,
    and of lordly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>dimensions. On one side of the ward is the kitchen,
    built against the inner ward wall; and opposite to it the well-known
    Norman chapel, the circular nave of which stands detached, but which
    formerly had a chancel which abutted upon the curtain.</p>

  <p>The outer ward contains at present but few buildings. Near the centre
    of its curtain is the outer gatehouse, and on its south side a range of
    Tudor buildings, probably stabling. One square tower, of early date,
    stands on the east wall, and indicates the boundary of the Norman
    castle; and another, later and semicircular, on the west wall above the
    river, bears the name of Mortimer. There were some later buildings,
    including probably a chapel, at the south-west corner of this ward;
    but these are in part pulled down, and this quarter of the ward has
    been walled off, and a public footway made across it. This footway
    passes through two modern doorways in the outer curtain, the thickness
    of which is thus seen. The ditch covering the middle is, of course,
    actually within the outer ward. It is cut in the rock, 13 yards broad,
    4 yards deep. 150 yards long, and in part revetted; the revetment
    being, no doubt, a long subsequent addition. It is crossed and closed
    at each end by the curtain, and must always have been dry, or nearly
    so. The general position, and to some extant the plan, of Ludlow,
    suggests a comparison with Barnard Castle, the outline of which is also
    Norman.</p>

  <p>Before considering the interior of the castle, it will be convenient to
    bestow a few words upon the walls as seen from the exterior, especially
    along the road and north fronts. Commencing with the south-west angle,
    where the front wall branches off towards the river bridge, first comes
    Mortimer‚Äôs Tower, half-round in plan, and in the early English style,
    in which Hugh Mortimer is said to have been imprisoned in about 1150,
    but which seems of later date. It has a close gorge-wall, a basement
    at the ground level, and three upper floors. The basement is vaulted,
    groined, and ribbed, but the ribs and a large window are insertions.
    There is a well-stair in the north-east angle, and the upper floor
    communicates laterally with the curtain, which is lofty. Just below the
    line of the parapet is a row of corbels intended to support a wooden
    gallery or <i lang="fr">br√©tasche</i>. This tower is of early English or early
    Decorated date, with additions of the Perpendicular and Tudor periods.
    Next to this, upon the wall, is the bakehouse tower, placed at the
    junction of the exterior curtain and that of the middle ward, and to be
    described with the keep. Beyond this tower the original Norman wall has
    been raised to 40 feet. In it is what seems to have been a sewer-mouth.
    Next follows the postern tower, a small Norman tower, square, of bold
    external and no internal projection, having a Norman door in its gorge;
    and another, the postern, of 4 feet opening, in its northern face.
    This tower is closed up and inaccessible. The upper part seems an
    addition. It marks the junction of the inner and middle wards. From it
    the curtain is continued northward at the same height; the lower part,
    at the least,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> being original. Inside, various buildings, now removed,
    were placed against this wall, and the wall itself is pierced by
    chambers and galleries not now accessible. Upon it is corbelled out the
    vent of a mural garderobe, which has been supplemented by the addition
    of a hollow shaft placed as a buttress below the corbels.</p>

  <p>At the north-west angle is a group of towers, forming the angle, and
    which contain the buttery. The first has a rectangular projection, in
    the base of which is a round-headed sewer of 2 feet opening. Connected
    with this is a second tower, a half-octagon in plan, much patched and
    added to, but the lower part of which is Norman, and the upper early
    Decorated. This group is very lofty, and has a battering base, so that
    the weight is thrown backwards well within the edge of the cliff.
    Across the hollow angle, between this last tower and the north curtain,
    is turned a Norman squinch arch, in the soffit of which is the vent,
    and above, the loop window of a garderobe. This curtain forms the wall
    of the great hall and adjacent building. A large stone spout marks the
    buttery, and beyond are the three exterior windows of the hall. This
    wall crowns a cliff of about 40 feet, below which a broad platform
    has been cut in modern times, and from which a second steep slope of
    50 feet or 60 feet descends to the meadows. The hall wall ends in a
    half-octagon, within which is the staircase to the private apartments;
    and beyond this again is the garderobe tower‚Äîa large rectangular mass
    of great height and breadth, and very bold projection, and entirely of
    Decorated date. In each of the three faces, at the base, are two large
    shoulder-headed recesses, each containing a vent, the sloping shoot
    from which is 6 feet long. In the floors above are various windows, of
    one light with trefoiled heads, and above rises the lower part of a
    handsome octagonal chimney shaft.</p>

  <p>Beyond the garderobe tower is the wall of a part of the private
    apartments, mainly of Decorated date, but much altered. In its base
    are three large early Perpendicular windows of two lights, trefoiled,
    with tracery in the heads; and above are various Tudor insertions of
    inferior taste and workmanship, and the timbers of two balconies.
    This face of the middle ward ends in a square tower of Norman date,
    which stands at the junction of the walls of the outer and middle
    ward. From hence the wall is of the outer ward, and seems to have been
    rebuilt partly in the reign of Elizabeth, to which belongs a small
    square-headed door, outside which are some ruins upon a platform of
    rock about 30 feet broad. From hence the wall is modern, nearly to the
    Norman tower, from which to the gatehouse it is probably Norman. Beyond
    the gatehouse, to the river cliff, the wall is 5 feet to 6 feet thick
    and 40 feet to 50 feet high. It is old, but probably not original. The
    ditch is filled up, and trees have grown along its line, two or three
    of which must be above a century old.</p>

  <p>The <em>Inner Ward</em>.‚ÄîThe keep stands on the higher part of the
    enclosure, but at some distance from the river cliff, nor has it
    any natural advantages for defence. It was not intended to stand
    alone, but, as is often the case with keeps of that age, is placed
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>upon the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, and so forms part of the general line of
    defence. It is peculiar in that its original plan, though rectangular,
    had two slight ears or projections, and it was, in fact, slightly
    <img class="iglyph" src="images/t.png" alt="T" />-shaped, and had communications right and left through the
    arms of the <img class="iglyph" src="images/t.png" alt="T" /> with the curtain wall on which it stood. This
    is very unusual, and quite an exception to the jealousy with which
    the entrances to Norman keeps are usually guarded. In this respect it
    is rather a large mural tower than a keep. It has been much altered
    at various periods, both within and without, and the history of these
    successive alterations is by no means easy to unravel. The keep is 40
    feet long on its south face, which projects about 7 feet beyond the
    curtain into the outer ward. This is the cross limb of the <img class="iglyph" src="images/t.png" alt="T" />.
    The stem projects from the curtain into the inner ward about 30 feet,
    and is 31 feet broad.</p>

  <p>In the original building there was a basement nearly at the ground
    level and a lofty upper floor with an open roof. The exterior was
    plain. It had a low plinth, but no pilaster strips, save that at the
    end of the east wall there is a sort of pilaster 6 feet broad by 1
    foot deep. On the south face a string of half-hexagonal section runs
    a little above the level of the first floor, and on the east and west
    faces, a little higher up, are sets-off of 5 inches. The upper story
    is marked by a similar set-off all round. The north, south, and west
    walls at the base are 7 feet 6 inches thick, and above it 5 feet.
    The east wall, containing the staircase, is 9 feet 6 inches thick.
    Two additions have been made, which much affect the ground plan. On
    the west, the hollow angle of the <img class="iglyph" src="images/t.png" alt="T" /> has been filled up by a
    building 11 feet broad by 24 feet long, which is carried up to the top,
    and enters partly into the composition of a north-west turret. The wall
    of this building is only 3 feet thick. The corresponding hollow angle
    on the east face is also filled up by a mass of masonry 9 feet thick,
    but which goes no higher than the first floor. It contains a cell,
    the porter‚Äôs prison, and a passage leading from the main gate to the
    well-stair of the keep. The porter‚Äôs prison is barrel-vaulted, is not
    bonded into the keep, and is probably very late Norman. There is in the
    keep wall, partly seen in the vault, a loop or window, though there is
    no indication inside from whence it opened.</p>

  <p>The existing keep is composed of a basement and three floors. At
    present the basement chamber is entered by a door in the north wall
    from the inner ward, the first and other floors by a well-stair in the
    east angle, entered from the main gate. The basement is three steps
    below the ground level. It is 31 feet north and south and 14 feet
    5 inches wide. It has a high-pointed vault, a loop in the south or
    outer end, and in the north end a loop, and above it a window, and by
    their side the door from the inner ward. The window recess is slightly
    pointed, that of the door more decidedly so, but the exterior facing
    of both door and window is late Perpendicular, four-centred in a flat
    head. In the side walls, at their north end, on each side is a Norman
    arcade of two arches, plain and shallow, springing from plain detached
    columns with fluted and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> cushion capitals, the whole resting on a low
    bench. The arcades begin a foot from the north wall, and the arches
    are full centred, but of unequal span, 4 feet 3 inches and 5 feet 11
    inches. The western arcade has been walled up and is only partially
    seen. On the east side, at the southern arch, the column is gone, and
    the lower half of its nook is occupied by a sort of altar of square
    stones, having a large flat stone on its top. The whole work is rude.
    There are no drips or hood mouldings, and a mere attempt at an incised
    ornament. The arcade is recessed about a foot. In the east wall, near
    its south end, are two square-headed doors of 2 feet opening and 7
    feet 6 inches apart. Each opens into a passage 3 feet 7 inches long
    and 2 feet 7 inches broad, and these end in, and are connected by, a
    cross gallery 12 feet long and 2 feet 6 inches broad. These passages
    are lined with ashlar and are 6 feet 7 inches high, and flat-topped.
    The roof is formed of rubble, wedged tight and plastered. Also, each
    doorway has a rebate and bar-hole, showing that the door opened
    inwards, and was fastened on the inner side or from the passage, into
    which, however, there was no other way. It appears also that the great
    chamber was formerly divided by a cross wall, so placed that one of
    these doors opened into each chamber, and a step in the rubble vaulting
    shows where this wall crossed, and that there was a slight difference
    in the height of the vault on its two faces. The southern of the two
    doorways has been mutilated and a Norman pier has been inserted, but
    this seems modern, and a clumsy device to support the roof. It is
    difficult to understand for what purpose this very curious passage was
    constructed. It afforded a way from the outer to the inner room, but
    this does not account for the position of the bar-holes. Moreover, as
    regards the large room, the arcade seems strangely out of place. It
    was certainly confined to two arches on each side; and as the room
    lies north and south, it could scarcely have been a chapel, neither is
    it likely that it was a room of state. The wall seems at one time to
    have been lined with ashlar, and there are ashlar bands in the vault,
    a part of which is built of hammer-dressed stone, and part of very
    ordinary rubble. The arcade and probably the substance of the building
    are rather early Norman, and the vault and north wall seem additions in
    the early English period. This chamber has no communication with the
    additions either upon the east or the west front.</p>

  <p>The first floor is exactly above the basement, and measures 30 feet
    by 17 feet 6 inches. In its south end is a Tudor window, no doubt
    replacing a Norman loop; and in its north end are two windows in
    Tudor recesses, and between them a Tudor fireplace. In the west wall,
    north end, a round-headed door opens into a side-chamber 8 feet by 13
    feet, vaulted, but with a timber floor, having windows to the north
    and west, and in its east or keep side two round-headed recesses of
    3 feet 8 inches opening, and 3 feet deep. In the south end of this
    room a narrow passage leads into a garderobe chamber, 7 feet 6 inches
    by 5 feet, with a loop to the west. Between the two rooms is a block
    of masonry which contains the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>shafts of the garderobes from the
    upper story. In the other or south end of the west side of the main
    room, a lofty full-centred arch of 5 feet 10 inches opening, is the
    mouth of a vaulted lobby, 13 feet 7 inches long; at first 5 feet 10
    inches wide, and then reduced to 3 feet 2 inches. This opens upon the
    south curtain, west of the keep. In the south wall of the lobby is a
    small round-headed window in a plain recess, and outside, flanked with
    nook-shafts, the only ornamented Norman window in the keep. Opposite,
    in the east wall, is a door, of 4 feet 3 inches opening, which leads
    into a vaulted and groined chamber, 8 feet square, with a loop to the
    south, and to the east a short passage 4 feet wide, which opens upon
    the south curtain and leads to the upper floor of the gatehouse. In
    the north wall of the chamber is the head of a straight staircase,
    which threads the east wall of the keep, and was the original entrance
    from the ground level to the first floor. The staircase is of ashlar,
    barrel-vaulted, and fifteen steps are still to be seen. Returning to
    the main chamber, there remains to be noticed a door at the north
    end of the east wall, which opens into a well-stair, and from it by
    an outer door into what was the first floor of the gatehouse. This
    well-stair occupies the north-east angle of the keep. It is entered by
    a vaulted rising passage in the east wall from the main gate at the
    ground level, and the staircase rises to the ramparts, opening upon the
    first and two upper floors. At present its door and window openings are
    Tudor, but the staircase itself is probably much older. It is evident
    that here was the original entrance to the keep, as at Chepstow and
    Carlisle, whence a straight stair led up the centre of the wall to the
    first floor; but when the lower part of the well-stair was inserted,
    the straight stair was walled up, and so remains. At Chepstow and
    Carlisle, besides the staircase, there was a door which gave entrance
    to the basement floor. This could not have been the case here, for it
    would have cut the arcade. The cill of the south-east door shows the
    floor of the first floor chamber to have been slightly raised, which
    was, no doubt, done when the vaulting was inserted. There are two
    square holes in the floor, intended to give air to the main room below,
    and probably late insertions. This story was 12 feet 6 inches high.
    From it seventeen steps in the well-staircase lead to a Tudor door into
    the second floor.</p>

  <p>The second floor is of the same dimensions with the first. In its
    south wall is a Tudor window, no doubt replacing one of Norman date;
    and in the north wall two windows, square-headed, but in round-headed
    though not Norman recesses. In the east wall, besides the staircase
    door, is a Tudor fireplace, possibly only refaced in that style. This
    wall has been much altered and patched, and the fireplace is probably
    an insertion. In the west wall, at its north end, a door opens into a
    lateral chamber, above that appended to the first floor, and in it are
    two garderobes. It has a square-headed loop to the north and three to
    the west, the central one in a round-headed recess. On a level with
    this chamber, and probably opening from it, is a small chamber over
    the west lobby. This has a loop to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> the west, but is not accessible.
    There is a similar chamber over the east lobby, but how entered does
    not appear. This second floor is 11 feet 10 inches high, and from it
    nineteen steps ascend to the floor above.</p>

  <p>The third floor, also entered by a Tudor doorway from the staircase,
    is of the same dimensions with the floor below. In the east wall is
    a fireplace, also Tudor, and in the west wall, at the north end, a
    square-headed door, opening into the third floor of the appended
    chamber. This chamber has a Decorated window in its north wall, and had
    a timber floor and ceiling, and is crossed by a round-headed arch which
    supports the south wall of the north-west turret. A weather-moulding in
    the south wall shows that this appendage had at first a lean-to roof.</p>

  <p>The south wall of the main chamber has also a weather-moulding, showing
    that this wall was once a gable, and that the keep had originally
    a high-pitched roof with a central ridge. A Tudor window has been
    inserted into the wall, and cuts through the moulding. The north wall
    is pierced by two round-headed recesses, in which are trefoil-headed
    windows of one light, and apparently of Decorated date. There is no
    weather-moulding at this end, one of the many indications that this
    wall has been rebuilt. This floor, like that below it, is 11 feet 10
    inches high, and from it nineteen steps ascend to the battlements,
    opening by a Tudor door at the stair-head. The stair ends in a
    rectangular turret, 15 feet by 9 feet. The north-west turret, 8 feet
    by 10 feet, has no opening from the ramparts. The two southern turrets
    are larger, and both have exterior staircases of twelve stairs leading
    to their flat roofs. The south-west turret is 15 feet by 14 feet, and
    the south-eastern, not now accessible, is about 15 feet square. The
    north and south walls are here 5 feet thick, two being occupied by
    the embattled parapet. The east wall is 9 feet thick, and contained a
    double chimney-flue. The west wall is double, the inner 4 feet thick,
    being the wall of the keep, and the outer 3 feet to the wall of the
    appendage. The space between, 5 feet 8 inches broad, was covered by a
    flat roof, so that the rampart here was 12 feet 8 inches broad within
    the parapet. There were two embrasures on each face of the keep, and
    the roof last laid upon it was flat.</p>

  <p>The keep seems originally to have been built by Roger de Lacy, 1086 to
    1096, as a plain <img class="iglyph" src="images/t.png" alt="T" />-shaped tower, upon and a part of the curtain
    wall. It had a basement floor at the ground level, and one upper floor
    of considerable height, with an open, high-pitched roof, of which the
    north and south walls, nearly if not quite of their present height,
    formed the gables, just as in the Norman gatehouse of Sherborne Castle.
    Probably the side walls were nearly as high as the gables, so as to
    conceal the roof. The basement was entered at the ground level by a
    door in the north wall. It had at least two arches of an arcade in each
    of its side walls, and was probably divided by a cross wall into two
    chambers, the inner being entered by the passage in the east wall. The
    entrance to the upper floor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> also on the ground level, but in the
    east wall, and therefore in the middle ward. It was by a small door and
    short passage, from which, on the south or left, a staircase threaded
    the east wall, and landed in a vaulted lobby at the level of the first
    floor. This lobby and one opposite to it led out upon the curtain. How
    the keep battlements were reached is uncertain, possibly by the present
    well-staircase, which, in that case, then commenced at the first-floor
    level.</p>

  <p>The first alteration made in the Norman period was probably a century
    later than the original building. This consisted in the addition of
    a building on the west front, filling up the hollow angle of the
    <img class="iglyph" src="images/t.png" alt="T" />. It contained a basement, which seems to have been a
    cesspit, and is now entered by a breach, and is vaulted. The roof was
    a lean-to. To enter the first floor of this building a door was opened
    in the wall of the keep. Also on the opposite or east side a mass of
    masonry was built into the hollow angle of the <img class="iglyph" src="images/t.png" alt="T" />. This,
    however, stopped at the first-floor level, and was probably intended to
    give a second passage between the first floor and the gatehouse. In
    the block was a vaulted prison cell for the porter, and a passage which
    led into and covered the entrance of the keep.</p>

  <p>At a later date, during the early English period, still greater changes
    were made. The north wall was either rebuilt or refaced, the basement
    was vaulted, and the north-east angle was taken down and rebuilt,
    a well-stair being probably inserted into it. At the same time the
    lateral walls and the west appendage were raised, the first floor
    fitted with a flat ceiling, and two floors inserted above it, with
    doors into the western appendage, and two turrets were carried up at
    the two northern angles of the building.</p>

  <p>The next and final alteration occurred in the Tudor period, when the
    vault of the eastern entrance was rebuilt, and faced with an outer
    door-case, the well-staircase fitted with doors and loops, and the old
    straight staircase walled up, and fireplaces inserted in the walls.
    Also the north door and window of the basement were refaced. Of course
    all this is a matter of opinion only, the alterations having been so
    great, and of so complete a character, that it is difficult to form
    even a theory concerning them. This is one of the most curious and
    perplexing Norman keeps now standing. It is much to be desired that its
    owner would cause an accurate plan and section of it at each floor to
    be made and published.</p>

  <p>The curtain connecting the keep with the <em>Bakehouse Tower</em> is
    36 feet by 38 feet long, 7 feet thick, and about 20 feet high to the
    ramparts, but it had a covered passage, and rose towards the tower,
    probably having a narrow staircase communicating with the second
    floor, while the main gallery opened into the first floor. The tower
    is rectangular, about 23 feet by 27 feet. It projects 16 feet into the
    ditch, and its interior measures 15 feet by 11 feet. It was originally
    open at the gorge into the inner ward, the masonry being replaced, as
    at Cologne and Avignon, and as in the later gatehouse of the Tower
    of London, by a timber partition. A large oven has been built at the
    ground level, filling up the whole area, and an arch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span> turned at the
    first-floor level, supporting a wall, which replaces the timber work
    in the upper floors. In this wall are a fireplace, small oven, and
    window. A door in the east wall opens from the curtain, and in the
    west wall another door opens into a mural passage in the west or outer
    curtain, in which it has a loop. On the left, or south, is a garderobe
    chamber, 6 feet by 5 feet, with a loop to the south, and in the
    opposite direction the passage runs 11 feet, descending four steps. It
    probably was continued in the substance of the curtain to the postern
    tower, but is now walled up. The upper or second wall of the tower is
    not accessible. It seems to be on the pattern of the first floor, and
    is entered by an exterior staircase from the south curtain, and on the
    other side has a garderobe and passage opening upon the rampart of the
    west curtain, towards the postern tower. The bakehouse tower is Norman,
    and of the age of the keep. Its floors were of timber.</p>

  <p>The <em>Postern Tower</em> is spiked up and inaccessible. It is about the
    size and height of the bakehouse tower, and of the same date, but its
    gorge was always closed. At the ground level a small door opens from
    the inner ward, and there is a similar door on the north and outer face
    of the tower, which is the postern. Both are full centred and plain.
    This tower has no internal projection. In the ward, close to the tower
    door, in a most inconvenient position, is the well, with a shaft worked
    roughly in the rock, 8 feet in diameter. It is now partly choked up.</p>

  <p>The cross curtain from the postern is carried straight to the
    north-east angle of the ward, and thence turns south, till it abuts
    upon the keep. This wall, though probably Norman, is not so old as the
    keep or main curtain, so that in the original castle the inner and
    middle ward seem to have been one. There is a round-headed door in the
    curtain near its north-east angle, which opens between the inner and
    middle ward.</p>

  <p>The <em>Middle Ward</em> is the most important division of the castle.
    In it are the domestic and state buildings, the chapel, the kitchen,
    and the great gatehouse. The principal buildings occupy its north side,
    resting upon and partly forming the exterior curtain wall. Near the
    centre is the hall. This was a noble apartment, 60 feet long by 30 feet
    broad, and 35 feet high to the springing corbels of its open timber
    roof. The recesses for the hammerbeams remain, and the corbels on which
    the principals rested. Owing to the low springing of the main timbers,
    the roof had from within the appearance of a very high pitch, which
    the water table shows not really to have been the case. The hall is
    on the first floor, and approached from the court by a broad exterior
    staircase, opening in the south wall near its west or lower end. In the
    north wall are three long narrow windows of one light each, trefoiled,
    and crossed by a heavy transom, and in the east end of this side a
    small door leads, probably, into a garderobe. The view from these
    windows is up the Teme and Corvedale. In the south wall are three large
    windows looking upon the court; they are of two lights, trefoiled, and
    crossed by a transom. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span> recesses have equilaterally arched heads,
    and the angles are replaced by filleted beads. One window only has a
    stone seat. The great door, towards the west end of this side, matches
    with the window recesses, though a little lower. In the west end are
    two buttery doors of unequal size, and at the north-west corner a door
    opens, as at Pembroke, into a well-stair to the roof. In the east end
    of the hall, near the north-east corner, and high up, is a combined
    door and window‚Äîa sort of hatch, by means of which those in the upper
    state room could either look into the hall or step down into the
    gallery that ran across above the dais. The central south window has
    been blocked up, and converted into a late Tudor fireplace. No doubt
    the original grate, as at Penshurst, stood in the middle of the hall.</p>

  <p>West of the hall is the buttery tower, a very fine group, which
    occupied the north-west angle of the ward. Part of it projects boldly,
    and caps the north-western angle of the curtain. The part within the
    ward is also rectangular. The part connected with the curtain is
    Norman, and was a large rectangular tower with an open gorge. In its
    base are two round-headed doorways, now nearly buried, whence mural
    passages led to garderobes in the curtain. The older part has been
    raised, and a pointed arch turned, and upon it a wall built, closing
    the gorge at the second floor. This tower has had large additions on
    its inner face, and is now a part only of the building, of which the
    basement seems to have been a store, and the first floor, 33 feet by 27
    feet, a serving-room and buttery attached to the hall. This room was
    entered by a side-door on the great hall staircase, so that the dishes
    were brought from the kitchen up the great stair, but not through the
    great door of the hall. In the buttery is a large fireplace.</p>

  <p>At the other or east end of the hall are the state rooms, contained
    within a grand and lofty structure, rectangular in plan, and projecting
    beyond the hall. Whether the foundations are Norman, or whether, like
    the superstructure, the whole is of Decorated date, is doubtful. The
    material is excellent ashlar. There are a basement and two upper
    floors. In the first is a grand fireplace; but the principal apartments
    were on the second floor. The door and window openings are numerous and
    varied. Some are excellent Decorated, with lancet and segmental arches;
    others are insertions in florid Perpendicular; and others, in wretched
    taste and of base materials and workmanship, are of Tudor date. The
    upper room has also a large fireplace, and the abutments of the hood
    are two carved heads. The north window is of one light, and of great
    length, divided by transoms. The south window is of similar character,
    but has two lights. This upper room had an open roof of low pitch,
    supported by three pairs of principals.</p>

  <p>Next to these rooms, on the east side, is a smaller pile of buildings,
    also rectangular, which fills up the space between the state rooms and
    the north-eastern tower. This, probably, was appropriated below to
    servants‚Äô apartments, and above to the principal bedrooms. There are,
    in the basement, three fine early Perpendicular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> windows of two lights,
    trefoiled, and with the centre mullion carried through the head.
    Windows of this size, so low down in an outer wall, are rare, and what
    is also curious, they open from two rooms by no means remarkable for
    size or ornamentation. This part of the suite, originally Decorated, on
    perhaps a Norman foundation, seems to have been remodelled or rebuilt
    in the Perpendicular period. Connected with these buildings and with
    the state apartments, and abutting upon both, is the garderobe tower‚Äîa
    grand rectangular structure projecting from the curtain, and wholly
    of ashlar, and of Decorated date. It is composed of a basement and
    four upper floors. The basement is occupied by several garderobes, the
    spacious outlets of which have already been described. The upper floors
    seem to be connected with the state rooms, and in the walls are many
    small chambers not accessible. The windows are of one light, trefoiled,
    usually with a transom. Between this building and the hall, projecting
    outside the curtain, is a multiangular turret containing a staircase.</p>

  <p>The north-eastern tower caps the angle of the ward. It is rectangular
    in plan and of Norman date. It forms a part of the two curtains of the
    middle and outer ward, standing upon each. In its base a door leads
    into a mural passage in the east curtain, now blocked up with rubbish,
    and in its first floor is a garderobe in the north wall.</p>

  <p>The kitchen, wholly of Decorated date, is a large rectangular building,
    placed against the wall of the inner ward, but free on the other three
    sides. It has two large windows to the east, and an excellent door in
    the north wall opposite to the hall staircase. The flagging of the
    floor remains, and parts of the large fireplace on the west side,
    with a couple of small side ovens. It has had divers Perpendicular
    additions. The back kitchen was to the west, and it is probable that
    a breach in the adjacent wall of the inner ward represents a late
    doorway, communicating with the well and the great oven.</p>

  <p>The <em>Gatehouse</em> is approached from the middle ward by a bridge
    over the ditch, of which the inner end was broken by a drawbridge,
    flanked by walls with loops. The gateway has a low-pointed arch, on a
    tablet above which are the arms of Elizabeth and those of Sir Henry
    Sydney, with the date 1581. As the curtain is 7 feet thick, and bonded
    into the keep, it is evidently original, and the door fittings are an
    insertion. There is no portcullis. The entrance door opened into a
    passage, having the porter‚Äôs prison and the entrance to the keep on
    the left, and on the right the gatehouse chambers. The building is of
    the age of Elizabeth, and very inferior to the older work. Probably
    the original entrance was by a mere archway in the curtain, as at
    Kenilworth and Bridgenorth.</p>

  <p>The <em>Chapel</em>, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Magdalen, is the most
    remarkable part of the castle. It stands out in the centre of the
    middle ward, between the gatehouse and the hall. All of it that remains
    is the circular nave. This is 28 feet in interior diameter, with
    walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span> 4 feet thick. It has an entrance door to the west, and a large
    chancel arch to the east. The rest of the interior is occupied by a
    mural arcade of fourteen arches, seven on a side, resting on a low
    stone bench. The arches are alternately chevron moulded and beaded, the
    capitals cushion-shaped and roughly ornamented. Above the arcade was
    a timber gallery resting upon twelve corbels, of which one is decided
    Norman and one early English. Light was admitted by three windows, to
    the west, north, and south. That over the door was round-headed, with
    plain flanking detached shafts, and round the head a chevron and double
    billet moulding. Outside, these windows rest upon a billeted string,
    the flanking shafts are engaged, with small plain caps and bases, and
    the ring-stones, of considerable breadth, rest upon an abacus, and are
    worked in chevron and billet mouldings. The north and south windows are
    quite plain.</p>

  <p>The west door is a fine example of enriched late Norman work. Outside,
    it stands in a double recess, having detached nooked flanking shafts,
    two on each side, with fluted capitals, and the semi-circular spaces
    above the flutes are covered with a small indented pattern, a sort
    of hollow nail-head. Of the four, all the caps and one shaft remain.
    The actual doorway has plain, square jambs. Above, a bold, simple
    abacus, the under chamfer of which is hollow, has the face carved with
    the rudimentary dog-tooth ornament. Over the door is a deep chevron
    moulding. The next ring, over the inner shafts, has a bold beading,
    and the outer, and much the broadest ring, has a chevron moulding
    reduplicated, and above it a double billeted drip.</p>

  <p>The chancel arch is large, round-headed, and of three ribs, beneath a
    double billet moulding. The style of ornamentation resembles generally
    that of the west door. On the west face are two nook shafts on each
    side, and in addition two half shafts are placed as pilasters in the
    actual archway supporting the middle rib. This arch and that of the
    door have become slightly flattened by settlement, as is shown by the
    gaping of the soffit joints near the crown. The east face of this arch
    is quite plain, save that the abacus is returned. The original chancel,
    42 feet long, had a high-pitched roof, and there is a mark of a second
    and later one less steep. The side walls are gone. The curtain formed
    the east wall, and has no window. Outside, the nave is divided into two
    stages by a billeted string, on which the windows rest, and which is
    considerably above the top of the door. Above is a plain battlement of
    no projection, with embrasures one-half the breadth of the merlons.</p>

  <p>Two arches of the nave arcade have been pierced for Tudor windows, and
    a third, to the north, has been converted into a doorway. The north
    window has also been made a doorway, and it is evident that a light
    gallery of two stages was laid from the domestic apartments to the
    chapel, the upper one opening on the circular gallery. The original
    way to this circular gallery must have been by a wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> stair within
    the building. The chancel was standing in the reign of Charles <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    and had two Tudor windows in its north wall and windows in the roof,
    also the nave had a saddleback roof, of which the gables were east and
    west. The material of the chapel is coursed rubble. South-west of the
    chapel was, in Elizabeth‚Äôs time, a fountain. This chapel is, with great
    probability, attributed to Jocelyn de Dinan in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>
    (1100‚Äì1135), the Temple Church, which it resembles, dating from 1127.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em>.‚ÄîThe gatehouse has been much altered and
    mutilated. In front it presents the appearance of a gateway, with a
    low-pointed arch, in a curtain about 6 feet thick and 35 feet high, of
    which the merlons are pierced by plain loops. On each side the gate is
    a flanking wall, 3 feet thick, and projecting 8 feet, which, no doubt,
    covered the drawbridge. The arch looks Decorated, as is probably the
    curtain, though the battlements are probably modern. The ditch has been
    filled up, and large trees grow along its course. The only buildings in
    this ward are placed against the curtain, and have already been noticed.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence, material or by record, of any castle here before
    the Norman Conquest. The ‚Äúlow‚Äù or mound known to have been removed from
    the churchyard, and the memory of which is preserved in the name of
    the town, is the only ancient earthwork connected with the place, and
    was, no doubt, sepulchral. The original Norman castle seems to have
    stood on the present lines. It was composed of a keep, placed close to
    the entrance, and forming a part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. Westward, the
    keep was connected by a short curtain with the south-west or bakehouse
    tower, rectangular, of moderate size, and having its inner face or
    gorge open. From thence the curtain passed at right angles northwards
    along the edge of the rock to a second tower, also rectangular, and
    containing a postern. From thence, still along the edge of the rock,
    the curtain, probably 25 feet high, reached the north-west angle, where
    it was capped by a tower nearly rectangular, but placed diagonally, so
    as to cap the angle, and which was open in the rear. Thence the curtain
    passed eastwards, along the north front, to the north-east angle,
    where was a tower, square, or nearly so. No doubt the Norman domestic
    buildings were placed upon this curtain, and probably there was a
    central tower on the wall near the present garderobe tower. From the
    north-east tower to the keep was the curved curtain, probably then, as
    now, free from buildings, and outside of this a ditch, still remaining,
    and extending from cliff to cliff. Of this original castle there at
    present remain the keep, the bakehouse and postern towers, the base of
    the buttery, and much of the north-eastern tower, and more or less of
    the curtain.</p>

  <p>Later in the Norman period certain changes were made. The keep was
    raised and enlarged, the curtain forming the inner ward was built,
    and probably the well was sunk, and in the middle ward the chapel was
    built. The outer ward may have been part of the original design, or it
    may have been a late Norman addition; that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span> was not of later date
    than this is shown by the square mural tower. All the rest, curtain,
    gatehouse, and Mortimer Tower are later.</p>

  <p>The next changes were in the Decorated period, when very important
    alterations were made in the older parts, amounting almost to a
    reconstruction of the fortress. Very early in the period, perhaps
    before it, the north door and window of the basement of the keep were
    inserted, the vault turned, and probably the gateway remodelled. At a
    later date, but still early in the Decorated period, the hall, buttery,
    and domestic apartments were built along the north front and the
    kitchen.</p>

  <p>The works in the Perpendicular style are few, and are confined to
    alterations in the domestic apartments, and in the entrance passage to
    the keep and the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Then came the Tudor period, in which the castle had to be converted
    into a palace for the Presidents of the Marches. The base of the keep
    became a prison, the well-stair was probably inserted, the rooms fitted
    with Tudor windows and fireplaces, and the gatehouse was built. Much
    was done in fitting up the hall and domestic apartments, though in a
    slight and flimsy manner, so that most of this work has disappeared,
    and stables were built in the outer ward. The extinction of the
    Council of Wales, and the civil wars, put a stop to any outlay upon
    the place, and for some time it seems to have been freely pillaged,
    until it became a complete ruin, without floors, or roofs, or any kind
    of fittings in lead, iron, or timber. Of late years it has been so far
    cared for as to be protected against all injuries save those of time
    and weather, while at the same time it is freely open to all visitors.
    What is wanted for antiquarian purposes is that the mural passages
    should be cleared out, and a plan made of each floor.</p>

  <h3>HISTORY.</h3>

  <p>Ludlow is apparently a purely Norman fortress. Its earthworks, such
    as they are, or were, have nothing in common, either in position or
    character, with the hill forts of British origin, so common in that
    district; neither do they at all resemble the later and English works
    attributed to √Üthelfl√¶d and her countrymen in the ninth or tenth
    centuries, and of which Wigmore, Richard‚Äôs castle, and Shrewsbury are
    adjacent types. In plan, indeed, Ludlow is not unlike those works
    by which headlands and promontories on the seashore were frequently
    defended, it is supposed, by the Scandinavian sea kings, and of which
    the entrenchment at Flamborough Head is the finest example on record;
    but these are seldom, if ever, found far inland, nor is there anything
    in the two concentric segments of ditches which constitute, or did
    formerly constitute, the earthworks of Ludlow, inconsistent with the
    notion that they are Norman works.</p>

  <p>There is no mention of Ludlow in Domesday; but that record gives
    three places in the district bearing the name of Lude, of which one,
    belonging then to Osberne Fitz Richard, is demonstrated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> Mr. Eyton
    to be the later Ludlow. The termination necessary for its distinction
    was derived from a large ‚Äúlow‚Äù or tumulus, probably sepulchral, and
    which stood until 1190 on what afterwards became the burial-ground of
    the parish church. ‚ÄúLude‚Äù or ‚Äúlud‚Äù is thought by the same author to
    mean a ford, as, by a common pleonasm, in the adjacent ‚ÄúLudford.‚Äù The
    two other Ludes were distinguished by the names of their lords, and
    known as Lude-Muchgros and Lude-Sancy.</p>

  <p>Mr. Eyton has further shown, almost to demonstration, that Fitz
    Richard‚Äôs tenant in Lude was the much more considerable Roger de
    Lacy, and that when he decided here to build a castle, he obtained
    the lordship from Fitz Richard, and founded the castle within ten
    years after the survey, or about 1086‚Äì1096. Roger was a good type of
    a Marcher lord. In 1088 he was in rebellion against William Rufus,
    on behalf of Courthose, and again in 1095, when he took part in the
    Mowbray rising, was exiled, and so died.</p>

  <p>Rufus allowed his estates to pass to his next brother, Hugh, who,
    however, died childless between 1108‚Äì1121, when the estates fell to the
    Crown by escheat. Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> granted Ludlow to Pagan Fitz John, who also
    held Ewias Lacy, and who was slain by the Welsh in 1136, leaving no
    male issue. Stephen seems to have seized his lands, and to have placed
    as castellan in Ludlow a certain Sir Joyce or Gotso de Dinan, evidently
    a Breton knight. Shortly afterwards, Joyce was in rebellion, for in
    April 1139, Stephen, accompanied by Prince Henry of Scotland, laid
    siege to the castle, and constructed against it two ‚Äúcounter-forts.‚Äù It
    was at this siege that Stephen rescued Prince Henry, by his personal
    strength, from the grasp of a grappling-iron, thrown over him as they
    walked rather too near to the walls. It would seem that the castle was
    not taken.</p>

  <p>Joyce‚Äôs most dangerous foe was his neighbour, Hugh de Mortimer of
    Wigmore, of whom he obtained possession by means of an ambush, and
    detained him prisoner in the castle; a tower of which has been supposed
    by its name to commemorate this event. Joyce died, also without male
    issue, about 1166, after which event Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> gave or restored Ludlow
    to Hugh de Lacy, a descendant, though not in the male line, from the
    former family; Emma, the sister of Roger and Hugh de Lacy, having been
    the mother of a certain Gilbert, who took his mother‚Äôs name, and died
    1135, leaving Hugh de Lacy, the new grantee of Ludlow. This Hugh, who
    was a very powerful lord in Ireland, held both Ludlow and Ewias, and
    was custos of Dublin. Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> feared his power, and in 1181 seized
    upon Ludlow. Hugh was assassinated in Ireland in 1185, and left Walter,
    his son and heir, to whom Henry, in 1189, restored his father‚Äôs lands;
    but seems to have retained the castle and tower of Ludlow, which thence
    came to King John, to whom, in 1206, Walter de Lacy paid 400 marks, to
    be reinstated at Ludlow.</p>

  <p>John, however, again seized the castle in 1207, and gave it in charge
    to William de Braose, and for a time to Philip de Albini, and then
    to Thomas de Erdington. Nor did the king restore it till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span> 1214, when
    Ingelram de Cygoigne was directed to render it up, which he did,
    though unwillingly. Walter, like his father, was chiefly occupied in
    Ireland. In 1224 he gave up Ludlow to William de Gammages; no doubt to
    hold as a pledge for his own good conduct. He died in 1241, leaving
    Walter, his grandson, as his heir, who died under age. Walter left two
    sisters, of whom Matilda married, first, Peter de Geneva, one of the
    Proven√ßal favourites of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and who had the custody of Ludlow.
    Peter died childless, but in 1234 he made over to William de Lacy the
    constableship of the castle in fee. Lacy was to keep it in repair,
    and to maintain there a chaplain, porter, and two sentinels, and the
    expenses were to be allowed. In time of war, the lord was to garrison
    the place, and live in the inner, the tenant living in the outer,
    ward. Peter de Geneva died in 1249. His widow then married Geoffrey de
    Genville, a Poitevin, who was living in 1283, and who held the castle
    and half the manor, the other half belonging to Margery de Lacy, sister
    and co-heiress with Matilda, and who had married John de Verdon. During
    that period, and immediately after the battle of Lewes, when Simon de
    Montfort visited Wales in 1264, he took Ludlow Castle, which, however,
    he could have held but for a short time.</p>

  <p>Although Peter de Genville, son of Geoffrey and Matilda, died before
    both his father and mother, yet he had the castle at his death in
    1292. His daughter and heiress, Johanna de Genville, married Roger de
    Mortimer, Earl of March, who, in 1316, was joint lord of Ludlow with
    Theobald de Verdon, grandson of John de Verdon and Margaret de Lacy.</p>

  <p>The Mortimers held what they probably made the lion‚Äôs share of Ludlow
    for five generations, through some of the most turbulent times in
    English history; but under their rule Ludlow gave place to Wigmore,
    their chief seat, and the centre of their oldest estates and main
    power. Roger, the paramour of the she-wolf of France, received the
    young Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> at Ludlow soon after his father‚Äôs death with great
    magnificence, and not long before his own fall, attainder, and
    execution. Edmund, his son, recovered this and his other castles in
    1354, six years before his death. His grandson Roger, the fourth Earl
    of March, obtained the long separated moiety of the Lacy property
    by exchange with William de Ferrars, who had inherited it from the
    Verdons, and thus transmitted the whole of Ludlow to his son Edmund,
    the fifth earl, in whose time Sir Thomas Beaufort, afterwards Duke of
    Exeter, held the castle against the insurgent Welsh. The fifth earl
    died childless in 1424, when Ludlow Castle and the earldom of March
    descended to his nephew, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, who held
    it through the wars of the Roses, and transmitted it to his son, King
    Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> The borough of Ludlow profited by the assumption of the
    castle by the Crown. The townsfolk were steady Yorkists, and if they
    occasionally suffered, and that severely, from the fortunes of war, on
    the whole they were gainers. Their ancient franchises, dating at the
    least from the commencement of the thirteenth century, were confirmed
    in the reign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> of Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> by Richard, Duke of York, and in 1461 and
    1478 Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> gave them an extended charter, under which they were
    removed from dependence upon the castle. In 1472 the king sent his two
    sons to remain in the castle, where the Council of Wales established
    by him, sat in the name of the elder, the Prince of Wales, then but
    an infant in arms. They remained at Ludlow until 1483, when they were
    removed to a prison and a grave in the Tower. Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr> also sent
    Prince Arthur, his infant son, born in 1486, to Ludlow, and was himself
    a frequent visitor here till the prince‚Äôs untimely death in 1502. After
    that event the Council of Wales was established on a more regular
    footing, and placed under a lord president, who at first was a bishop.
    Money was granted for the repairs and maintenance of the castle, which,
    it appears from Bishop Lee‚Äôs report, in 1535 was in a ruinous state.</p>

  <p>In 1559 Queen Elizabeth appointed Sir Henry Sidney as lord president.
    He held the office twenty-seven years, keeping considerable state at
    the castle, where, on his return from Ireland, he passed the latter
    years of his life. He built the gatehouse within the middle ward, which
    the inscriptions inserted on the gate show to have been completed in
    1581. He built also a bridge leading into the castle, probably one
    to the outer gate, for the description does not accord with that now
    standing, and which leads to the middle gate. Also he repaired the
    chapel, and brought water into the castle, and did much in the way of
    general repairs, and of buildings and enclosures, to facilitate the
    business of the council and the custody of its prisoners. The keep,
    called then the porter‚Äôs lodge, was their prison, and the inner ward
    their court for exercise. Sir Henry died in May 1586. Whatever the
    Council may have been in his time, it became, in the reign of James, a
    source of great expense and scandal, and Richard Baxter has left on
    record the condition, moral and social, to which the purlieus of this
    provincial court were reduced during his youth. It fell, and it was
    time, with the surrender of the castle to the parliamentary army in
    1646. The place was dismantled, and in 1651 the furniture and fittings
    were inventoried and put up for sale. At the restoration an attempt was
    made to revive the Council, but the actual revival was nominal only,
    and even this was abolished on the coming in of King William. The Crown
    appointed a governor of the castle, and it would seem, by an inventory
    of goods there in 1708, that part of it at any rate was in very
    tolerable repair, especially the rooms of state. The final ruin was
    commenced under an order by George <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, when the lead was removed from
    the roofs. Buck, whose account was published in 1774, speaks of many
    of the apartments as still entire, and probably it was not absolutely
    roofless until the end of the century. In 1811 a lease held by the
    Powis family was converted by purchase from the Crown into a freehold.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="ST_LEONARDS_TOWER_WEST_MALLING">ST. LEONARD‚ÄôS TOWER, WEST MALLING.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS tower, apparently the earliest built and the last part remaining
    of the residence of Bishop Gundulf, is probably one of the first Norman
    keeps, perhaps one of the earliest military towers in masons‚Äô work,
    after the departure of the Romans, constructed in England. With these
    pretensions, it deserves more attention than it has hitherto met with.</p>

  <p>It stands about a quarter of a mile south-west of the parish church of
    Town, or West Malling, in Kent, the plain heavy tower of which is also
    attributed to the bishop; and a little further from the remains of the
    religious house founded by the same skilful and magnificent prelate,
    and a remaining part of which seems also to have been his actual work.</p>

  <p>The tower stands upon a ledge of horizontally-bedded sandstone rock,
    of a friable character, which juts out from and forms the east side of
    a short narrow combe, the defence of the castle on its western front,
    and which opens upon a stream tributary to the Medway, which stream
    receives a further addition from a spring which rises from beneath
    the rock about 100 yards south of the tower, and has been employed to
    strengthen the defences of the place on that side.</p>

  <p>The tower is a very plain rectangular structure of the early Norman
    type, about 32 feet square at its base, and about 60 feet high on its
    northern and eastern, and about 70 feet on the two other faces; the
    difference being produced by the greater depth of the rocky shelf.
    The walls rise from a plain plinth, the top of which is at the ground
    level on the east face and north-east angle, and 10 feet above the
    level on the south and west, so that the plinth is on these sides 10
    feet high. The tower is flanked at the end of each face by a pilaster
    strip, which rises from the plinth, and each adjacent pair meet and
    cover the contained angle. At three of the angles these strips have
    6-inch projection, and are 3 feet 6 inches wide, reduced by two
    sets-off to 2 feet 6 inches at the base of the parapet, into which
    they probably died. The pilasters covering the fourth, or north-east
    angle, are 7 feet broad, and of 18 inch projection. These also have
    two sets-off. This increased breadth and projection is to accommodate
    a turnpike-stair, which rises from the base to the roof, and was
    evidently crowned by a square turret, but whether there were turrets at
    the other angles is doubtful, though, if present, they must have been
    of rather smaller dimensions. In the centre of the west face is another
    pilaster, 3 feet broad, and of 6 inch projection. This also rises from
    the plinth, but stops at the level of the uppermost floor, at the base
    of the window, of which it forms the cill. Of the sets-off, that at
    the level of the first floor is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> carried round the tower; the upper
    one is confined to the pilasters. The parapet is gone, and the wall at
    the head of the staircase, being weakened by it, is somewhat broken
    down. The tower wall is described as battering, or inclining inwards;
    if so, the degree must be very slight, for its appearance is vertical,
    the set-off reducing it by about 6 inches or 8 inches, so that at the
    summit the dimensions cannot be less than 30 feet square, and the wall
    appears, from below, to be about 6 feet thick.</p>

  <p>The basement is without windows, but in the south face, near the east
    end, was a round-headed doorway, quite plain, without a portcullis
    or any moulding, and of about 3 feet 6 inches opening. This is now,
    and evidently has long been, walled up, so that any rebate it may
    contain for the door is concealed. It opened on the top of the rock,
    and probably was approached by a wooden exterior stair, which must
    have been 10 feet high. The present entrance is opposite to it at the
    same level, which, there, is that of the ground. This seems to have
    been a later opening, broken through where the wall was reduced in
    thickness by a sort of lobby at the foot of the staircase. This is a
    very common treatment with Norman keeps, the ordinary doorway becoming
    inconvenient, and the times ceasing to demand extraordinary precaution.</p>

  <p>The first floor has a plain round-headed flat-sided opening, that is,
    without splay, or what in the North is called flanning, placed in the
    centre of the north, south, and east faces. On the south face this
    window is in the centre of a plain arcade, having on each side of it
    two similar arches, about 3 feet broad and 2 feet deep. The singular
    thing is that these niches are in the outer face of the wall, not, as
    would seem natural, and as occurs at Chepstow, in the inner face. In
    the west wall are four similar niches, but the central space is solid,
    occupied by the pilaster. There are two narrow round-headed loops on
    the north face, lighting the staircase at two levels.</p>

  <p>The second and upper floor has four windows, one in each face. These
    are round-headed, quite plain, flat-sided, of about 4 feet opening
    and 8 feet high to the springing. The three floors seem to be,‚Äîthe
    basement, 15 feet high; the first or main floor, 30 feet; and the upper
    floor, 15 feet. The floors were all of timber. There is no visible
    fireplace, nor do there seem to be any mural chambers or galleries. The
    walls at the base are 8 feet thick. The staircase communicated with
    each floor, and with the roof. The line of the lower floor cut off the
    head of the original entrance doorway, as at Chepstow.</p>

  <p>The masonry throughout is of a very sound and solid, though of a rude
    description. It is evidently original, and does not appear ever to
    have been repaired or even pointed. It is of rubble, the stones being
    pretty much as they came from the quarry, of all shapes, but rarely
    containing more than a foot cube. The work is roughly but decidedly
    coursed, with a slight tendency to the herring-bone pattern. The joints
    are very open, and the mortar has been very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> freely used. The quoins
    and window-dressings are of a tufaceous ashlar, with wide joints.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to form any safe conclusion as to the plan or area of
    the castle, of which this tower was certainly the keep. No doubt it
    lay to the north-east and east, where the ground forms a table-land a
    little above the keep level, and where there are traces of some rather
    extensive earthworks. There is a short piece of curtain wall projecting
    a few yards from the south-east angle of the keep, and pointing
    eastwards. It looks of early masonry, but of rather later date than the
    keep, against which it is built without bond. It is about 25 feet high.
    According to this evidence the south and west faces, at the least,
    must have been the exterior, which, considering the arcades on their
    faces, and the position of the entrance-door, is curious. Probably the
    other end of the curtain abutted upon the north-east angle, but if
    so it did not bond, and has been destroyed, leaving no trace of its
    presence. This keep stands in three separate premises, two of which
    are, or rather were when these notes were taken, jealously closed.
    The only entrance is by the modern door, which was fastened and the
    key judiciously mislaid; nor, at that time, was there a ladder to be
    found within reach of the tower. The garden containing the earthworks,
    and within which probably stood the hall and lodgings, was attached
    to a private lunatic asylum. It is much to be desired that the Kent
    Arch√¶ological Society should take this curious tower in hand, and
    obtain proper plans and elevations of so very remarkable a building,
    with a good photograph of its masonry.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_KEEP_OF_MIDDLEHAM_CASTLE_YORKSHIRE">THE KEEP OF MIDDLEHAM CASTLE, YORKSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH the size and extent of Middleham Castle are but moderate for
    the figure it has made in local story, and the rank and power of the
    succession of great barons who built, augmented, and have inhabited it,
    it is in itself a remarkable building, and presents much of antiquarian
    interest. It is placed on the southern edge of the town of Middleham,
    and a little above it. Its immediate position presents no great natural
    advantages, but for the general defence of Wensley Dale, it is not ill
    chosen, standing between the Yore and the Cover, about a mile and a
    half above the junction of the two streams.</p>

  <p>In plan Middleham is rectangular, composed of a keep about 100 feet
    north and south, by 80 feet east and west, and to the base of its
    parapet about 55 feet high, which is placed in the centre of an
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, also rectangular, 240 feet north and south, by 190
    feet east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> and west, so that the area of its only ward is but limited.
    The <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> is a curtain wall, about 30 feet high. At its
    north-west and south-east angles, it has rectangular towers of slight
    external projection, which rise above the curtain. Its south-west angle
    is capped by a drum tower of three stages, and on the north face, but
    at its north-east angle, is the gatehouse, rectangular, of slight
    projection, but four stages high, basement included. The east curtain
    has been destroyed. Upon the south and west curtains are many exterior
    projections, buttresses, and near the centre of each a rectangular
    tower. The domestic buildings were chiefly placed against the curtains
    on the north, west, and south sides, and thus the ward is reduced to a
    mere passage between these buildings and the keep.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse is about 25 feet deep by 50 feet broad. It has in its
    exterior front a central portal, round-headed, beneath a pointed arch
    of relief. This is flanked by buttresses, 2 feet broad by 1 foot deep,
    and the adjacent angles of the building are supported by similar
    buttresses, two being set on each. At the first story these pass into
    a single buttress, which caps the angle,‚Äîa pleasing arrangement,
    giving variety to the outline. The entrance vault, like the gateway,
    is round-headed, with ribs for doors, and it has a single portcullis
    groove at its inner end. It is all of one date, and in the Decorated
    style. This gatehouse, and the buildings of the ward generally, are
    Decorated, and require far more examination than the writer has been
    able to bestow upon them.</p>

  <p>The <em>Keep</em> is reinforced at the four angles by broad, flat-capping
    buttresses, of variable breadth and projection, and which, no doubt,
    rose above the battlement into rectangular turrets. The buttress on
    the north-east angle has a breadth of 26 feet on the north, and a
    projection of 7 feet, and to the east a breadth of 16 feet, and a
    projection of 1 foot. It contains the chamber communicating with the
    battlement of the outer gate of the fore-building, and below is solid.
    The buttress on the north-west angle has to the north a breadth of 22
    feet, and a projection of 3 feet, and to the west a breadth of 12 feet,
    and depth of 1 foot. On the south-west angle the breadth of the west
    face is 14 feet, and of the south 11 feet, and the depth of each is 1
    foot.</p>

  <p>The south-east angle, as at Rochester, contains the staircase. It has
    no projection on the east face, being covered by the fore-building.
    On the south its breadth is 20 feet, and its depth 6 feet. This alone
    preserves the remains of a turret above the battlements. Excepting the
    stair-turret, the angles of the keep seem solid below, though worked
    into chambers on the first floor.</p>

  <p>There are also projections on the west and south wall. That on the west
    has a depth of 12 feet, and a breadth of 18 feet. The lower story is
    broken away; it was hollow, and looks as though meant for a gigantic
    cesspit. The upper part hangs unsupported save by the cohesion of its
    cement, and greatly needs conservation. This turret is about 51 feet
    from the north end, and 31 feet from the south. The projection on the
    south wall is 12 feet broad, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> 8 feet deep. It is placed 24 feet
    from the west, and 44 feet from the east angle, coinciding with the
    partition-wall within. This turret is hollow, and forms a great shaft
    for garderobes in the upper stories. In its face, at the ground level,
    is a round-headed arch, of 3 feet opening, and 4 feet high, the outlet
    of the sewer, but above ground. These two turrets at present cease at
    the level of the parapet, but probably rose sufficiently above it to
    cover a garderobe. The keep has a plinth on the north, west, and south
    sides. The east face is covered by the fore-building. The walls are
    about 9 feet thick.</p>

  <p>The keep has a basement floor at the ground level, and a first or state
    floor, and on the east side an upper floor. It is divided by a wall
    9 feet thick into two unequal parts, that to the east being 29 feet,
    and that to the west 24 feet broad, each being about 84 feet long. A
    well-stair 12 feet diameter, ascended in the south-east angle from the
    basement to the battlements, lighted by loops, and with doors to each
    floor.</p>

  <p>The east chamber into which this stair opens by a large and apparently
    round-headed door, now broken, was vaulted in two lines, each resting
    upon five cylindrical piers, about 3 feet 6 inches each in diameter,
    and averaging 14 feet from centre to centre. The vault seems to have
    been a barrel, groined. At each end were two square-headed loops,
    high above the floor, with stepped recesses. The east wall contains
    only three square lockers, and the door of the staircase. The west or
    partition-wall side is pierced by five openings, about 4 feet broad,
    and round-headed, three to the north and two to the south of the thick
    solid central part. Probably these were introduced to lighten the work,
    and all but one or two thinly walled up. One must have been a doorway,
    as from the eastern lay the only communication with the western chamber.</p>

  <p>The western chamber seems to have been spanned by a single vault,
    apparently slightly pointed and groined in six bays. In each end is
    a single square-headed loop. On the west side are seven loops, the
    central part being occupied by the unpierced rear wall of the turret
    already described.</p>

  <p>First floor, east side. This was evidently the hall. It is very lofty,
    and in its north end is a round-headed window of 2 feet opening, and 7
    feet high to the springing. In the south end are two similar windows,
    but about 14 feet long, and a curious water-drain between them and the
    door. This, the door from the stair, is plain round-headed, and of 6
    feet opening. Close north of it is a similar door, of 7 feet opening,
    quite plain, and without a portcullis. This is the main entrance, and
    opens from the barbican tower. Beyond this is a short window, and then
    three long ones, like those at the north end, so arranged as to open
    clear of the exterior barbican stair. The west wall has an opening at
    each end, the bulk of the wall being solid. The northern of the two
    openings was probably the great door of passage between the rooms;
    the southern communicated with the garderobe in the south wall. In
    the north-east angle is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> very curious mural chamber, 12 feet east
    and west, by 9 feet north and south, vaulted in a single groined bay,
    round-headed, and springing from half-octagon brackets in the angles,
    each the cap of a detached shaft, now removed. In the north wall are
    two and in the east one loop. A door in the south wall opens into
    the north end of the hall, and one in the east wall passes obliquely
    through the wall, and evidently led to the battlements of the outer
    gate of the barbican, over the foot of its staircase. This room is
    much broken, but its fittings are original, and late Norman. If the
    hall had a fireplace in masonry, it was in the west wall, at a part
    recently repaired. It is not clear how the hall was roofed; possibly
    the original covering was a high-pitched roof, with the battlements
    above, but at present the side walls carry a table, with corbels of
    a plain billet moulding, on which an upper wall, about 12 feet high,
    is advanced 6 inches. In these walls are large window openings, with
    segmental arches, three on each side, which must have opened clear of
    the roof of the west chamber, and upon the battlements on the east
    side. In the south end, above the two narrow windows mentioned, is a
    third smaller one, as though to light a roof of high pitch. There are
    no corbels for principals, and no holes for main beams, but above the
    corbel table on each side is a range of holes, about 9 inches square,
    and as much apart, neatly stopped with ashlar, as though an original
    flat roof had been removed, and a roof of high pitch introduced.
    However this may have been, the windows of the side walls are clearly
    additional, and belonged to a second floor. Altogether the history of
    this roof is very obscure, and demands a close local investigation. The
    upper door in the well-stair is not at a level to suit a second floor,
    nor consistent with a high-pitched roof.</p>

  <p>First floor, west side. In the north end is a round-headed window, 2
    feet opening by 7 feet high, and a door into a now inaccessible mural
    chamber in the north-west angle. At the south end are two similar
    windows, and a door into a chamber in the south-west angle. In the east
    wall are the two broken doorways already mentioned, and the broken
    tunnels of two, if not of three, large fireplaces, the shafts of which,
    much broken, still rise clear of the roof. The fireplaces are gone, and
    the wall has been much patched recently to give it support. There are
    two rather curious lockers in this wall. In the west wall there seem to
    have been four round-headed windows of 2 feet opening and 7 feet high,
    and near the middle is a door opening into the middle buttress tower,
    which contains two chambers of unequal size. These are not accessible,
    but one was probably a large garderobe, and the other may have been the
    way to a small drawbridge, opening from the keep upon a rectangular
    tower in the ward, not 12 feet distant, so as to give direct passage
    from the keep to the outer walls. In the keep wall, north of this
    tower, is a large segmental-arched window, evidently an insertion,
    probably the work of Richard <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> In the north-west and south-west
    angles, as already mentioned, are mural chambers, not accessible. There
    do not appear to be any galleries in the wall.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

  <p>This west chamber was probably divided by a brattice, and the north
    part used as a withdrawing-room from the hall. There does not appear
    to have been a second floor on this side. It is, however, curious
    that there should be no corbels, nor any of the usual indications of
    the principals of an ordinary open roof. In each side wall, high up,
    is a row of holes, about 9 inches square and 18 inches from centre
    to centre, so that probably the roof was flat, or at any rate, was
    composed of heavy rafters, without principals.</p>

  <p>The east face of the keep was occupied by the fore-building or
    barbican, and which, as was not uncommon, contained the chapel.</p>

  <p>The approach seems to have been, as at Rochester, Scarborough,
    and elsewhere, by a flight of stone steps built against the wall,
    commencing, in this case, about 10 feet from its northern end, and
    rising about 20 feet to a vestibule, upon which opened, right and left,
    the great door of the keep, and that of the chapel. The staircase was
    about 9 feet broad, and 45 feet or 50 feet long to the vestibule.
    It seems to have been protected by a side wall, reducing the actual
    stair-breadth to (say) 5 feet or 6 feet, and to have been either
    vaulted or roofed with timber. Its lower gate must have opened beneath
    a small tower, the battlements of which were reached from the chamber
    in the north-east angle of the keep. About half-way up the staircase
    past what, from the appearance of the wall, seems to have been a second
    gate in the keep wall, is a large cavity capable of holding comfortably
    twenty men, evidently as a guard in case the entrance should be forced.
    Higher up, where the staircase landed on the vestibule, there seems to
    have been a third door.</p>

  <p>The vestibule is part of the second floor of the usual rectangular
    barbican tower, built against the keep, about 12 feet from the south
    end of the east face. This tower measures about 33 feet north and
    south, and about 48 feet east and west. It rose about two-thirds of the
    height of the keep, and is divided into a basement or sub-crypt, an
    upper crypt, and a chapel and vestibule floor.</p>

  <p>The basement is at the ground level. Next the keep, or rather, next the
    solid mass of masonry which supports the stair and vestibule, is the
    sub-crypt, 20 feet north and south, by 24 feet east and west. Beyond,
    that is, east of it, a passage runs right through the building, 5 feet
    broad, with a door at each end; and beyond this are the ruins of a
    small chamber, which probably reached to the outer curtain wall. The
    passage gave a communication between the north and south parts of the
    ward, otherwise divided, on this side, by the barbican tower, and from
    this passage a door led into the sub-crypt. This room was vaulted in
    two lines in eight bays, springing from a central line of three columns
    now gone. The arch gables show that the vault was round-headed. In
    the south wall at the west end is a well-stair leading to the upper
    crypt, and the only way to it. The sub-crypt is lighted by two small
    round-headed Norman windows in each of the two open faces, one on each
    side of an exterior plain pilaster buttress, 3 feet broad by 3 feet
    deep.</p>

  <p>The first floor, or upper crypt, extended eastward over the passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
    the whole length of the barbican and was 20 feet broad, and probably
    40 feet long inside. This also was vaulted, but the vault spanned the
    whole breadth, and formed two bays only. The ribs of the groining
    sprang from half-round mural pilasters. In the north wall, near the
    east end, is a fireplace. This floor has no communication with that
    above it. It was not uncommon for the basement of the barbican to be
    quite independent of the keep, and to be entered, as here, by an outer
    door of its own.</p>

  <p>The second floor of the barbican contained the chapel and the
    vestibule, this floor being on the level of the great entrance to the
    keep. Whether the vestibule was vaulted is uncertain, probably it was.
    It is about 20 feet north and south, by 9 feet east and west, the
    entrance stair arriving at the north end, the keep door being on the
    west, and the chapel door on the east side. The chapel was loftier and
    vaulted in a lighter style than the crypts below. Its walls were 7 feet
    thick, and its area about 20 feet by 40 feet. It was vaulted in two
    bays in a light style, probably early English. The great door of the
    keep was plain Norman, but chamfered round the head and jambs. There
    are traces of caps, and probably there were two flanking shafts, but
    no mouldings or drip-stone. The walls of the barbican are, no doubt,
    mainly original, though the vaulting of the sub-crypt and crypt may
    have been renewed. The chapel probably replaces an earlier building.</p>

  <p>Middleham seems never to have had any works beyond the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>
    wall, save a slight ditch, of which traces remain on the south side
    only. On the east, a field road has superseded the ditch, as have some
    modern buildings on the west side. There is no present trace of either
    ditch or drawbridge on the north or town front.</p>

  <p>The keep is built of coursed rubble, with ashlar groins and dressings.
    The Decorated and later work is mostly of excellent ashlar.</p>

  <p>As regards the age of the several parts of the castle, the keep
    is plainly late Norman, and, likely enough, the work of Robert
    Fitz-Ranulph, Lord of Middleham, in 1190; and to his immediate
    descendants are certainly due the earlier alterations, especially the
    chapel, before the extinction of the male line, in 1271.</p>

  <p>No doubt the exterior ward is built on the site of a Norman
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, and some of the original work may remain; but this
    part of the fortress was completely recast by the Neviles, who married
    the Fitz-Ranulph heiress, and, no doubt, either by Robert, called the
    Peacock of the North, who had Middleham, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, from his grandmother, and
    who died before 5 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, 1331, or by Ralph, Lord Nevile of Raby,
    his brother and successor, who died 41 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1367.</p>

  <p>Of the later residence of Richard, Duke of York (Richard <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) the
    traces are the large window opening on the west face of the keep, and
    perhaps the upper story on the east side of the same building, and
    certain details added to the ward.</p>

  <p>Middleham was a part of the broad territory granted by the Conqueror
    to Alan Fergaunt, the founder of Richmond Castle, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> lord of that
    extensive Honour, stepping thus into the seat of the English Earl
    Edwin, which he shifted from the adjacent Gilling. His younger son,
    Ribald, had Middleham for his especial lordship, by the gift of the
    second Alan, his brother. Ribald was followed by Ralph, his son, and he
    by Robert FitzRalph, or Ranulph, who married Berta, niece of Ranulph de
    Glanvill, and is the reputed builder of Middleham Keep in 1191, 2 and 3
    Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p>Ranulph FitzRobert was the founder of Coverham Abbey, ‚ÄúNear his
    manor-house of Middleham,‚Äù and was there buried in 1251 (31 Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>), leaving Ralph Fitz Ranulph, his son, who appears to have been
    lord of Middleham Manor in an inquisition for the partition of his
    lands (55 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>), the year of his death. He left three daughters,
    co-heiresses, of whom Mary, the eldest, married Robert de Nevile, and
    had Middleham. Ralph died (55 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) 1271. It appears, by an
    inquisition under the name of Peter of Savoy, that Middleham was a fee
    owing suit of court to the Honour of Richmond. 18 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Maria de
    Nevile is styled Domina de Middleham, and 13 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> she had the
    manor. She lived till 14 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> (1320), having held Middleham for
    life.</p>

  <p>Their son was Ralph Nevile, who died 5 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, (1331), and who
    appears in an inquisition (1 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) as holding Middleham Manor
    and Castle. His son, Robert Nevile, the Peacock of the North, had from
    his grandmother the castle and manor of Middleham. He died, without
    issue, before his father, leaving Ralph his brother and heir, who died
    41 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> This Ralph, Lord Nevile of Raby, took a very active part
    in all the public transactions of his time, both in war and peace. He
    died seized of the castle and manor of Middleham, and was the first
    layman buried in the Cathedral of Durham.</p>

  <p>The next lord was John, his son, also a great soldier and diplomatist.
    He died 12 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, 1388, leaving Ralph, his son and heir, who
    added to the wealth and power of the family, and also held the castle,
    manor, and lordship of Middleham at his death in 4 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, 1425.
    John, son of Ralph, died before his father, 1423, who was succeeded
    by his grandson, Ralph, Earl of Westmoreland, who died 2 Richard <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    Middleham, however, had passed to Richard Nevile, Earl of Salisbury,
    son of Earl Ralph, who died 4 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, by his second wife, a daughter
    of John of Gaunt. The Earl of Salisbury, by an inquisition of 12
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, had then Middleham. This is the earl who, in 37 Henry
    <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, marched with 4,000 men from Middleham into Lancashire on his way
    to London, to obtain redress from the king and queen for injuries
    done to his son. On this earl‚Äôs forfeiture, before 38 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, his
    Lancastrian kinsman, Sir John Nevile, was made constable of Middleham
    Castle, then in the Crown. Sir John fell at Towton, 1 Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, and
    his son Ralph became Earl of Westmoreland. But Middleham remained in
    the Crown.</p>

  <p>At Middleham, then in charge of Nevile, Archbishop of York, Edward
    <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> was confined by Richard, Earl of Warwick, the prelate‚Äôs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> brother.
    Edward escaped when hunting in the park. After Barnet the castle was
    granted to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to the exclusion of the male
    heirs of the Marquis Montagu, Warwick‚Äôs brother. Richard was much here;
    raised the rectory to a deanery, with a view to the foundation of a
    college; and here his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was born. After
    Richard‚Äôs death, Middleham fell to the Crown, and was leased to various
    persons. Finally it was sold to Mr. Wood, of Littleton, ancestor of the
    present owner. Recently the keep has been partially cleared of rubbish,
    and some of the most dangerous portions have been under-pinned; but a
    little more assistance of the same character is much needed to save
    some of the most prominent features of the ruin from destruction.</p>

  <hr class="h20" />
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="MITFORD_CASTLE_NORTHUMBERLAND">MITFORD CASTLE, NORTHUMBERLAND.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS is one of the most remarkable of the Northumbrian castles. It is
    situated about two miles above and west of Morpeth, on the right bank
    of the Wansbeck, which here makes two very sharp bends, the larger and
    higher of which includes the castle, the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew, the
    new Hall, and the ruins of the old one. The church, the nave of which
    was long roofless, has been repaired, and is now in good order. It is
    the burial-place of the ancient barons and modern lords of Mitford.
    The chancel is early English; the nave rude but good Norman, with a
    pointed south door in the same style. The old Hall, of which a tower
    is standing, was a Tudor building, constructed by the Mitfords, in
    part from the materials of the castle. The present Hall, the Mitford
    residence, is modern.</p>

  <p>What remains of the castle occupies the summit of a knoll of sandstone
    rock, rising about 70 feet, on the north side abruptly, and elsewhere
    more or less steeply, from a marshy meadow, which on the north, east,
    and west is encircled by the folds of the Wansbeck, and on the south
    by a sweep of a tributary stream, which joins the river just below
    the castle. Each watercourse flows beneath a steep and high concave
    bank, thickly wooded, and the result is a sylvan amphitheatre of great
    seclusion and much beauty.</p>

  <p>The castle knoll, at its summit, is about eighty yards across,
    irregularly circular. Along its brow runs the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall
    of the place, much broken down, but which seems to have been about
    20 feet high and 7 feet thick. It may be traced all round, save at
    one point on the south face, where it is encroached upon by a quarry
    opened for the materials of the new Hall in 1810. Towards the north the
    wall is tolerably perfect, though more or less riven, and without its
    battlements. The inclosure is now an orchard.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

  <p>The northern portion of the area is somewhat higher than the rest, and
    has been parted off by a cross wall, creating an inner ward, of small
    dimension, semi-circular plan, and considerable strength. In this ward
    stands the Norman keep, a square of about 36 feet, but having its north
    side in two oblique faces, forming a salient. It has, therefore, five
    sides, a rare and certainly original departure from the usual Norman
    plan. The walls are about 7 feet thick, and the interior area 22 feet 6
    inches square. This space is divided by a cross wall, north and south,
    into two equal parts, each barrel-vaulted, with a plain, round-headed
    arch springing from a plain chamfered abacus. The north face of each
    chamber is oblique, to match the exterior salient. Of these chambers,
    one has a loop in the north gable, and the other, in the corresponding
    place, two small stone spouts, about 3 feet from the floor, as though
    for the admission of water. Both chambers are ruined at the south end.</p>

  <p>All the keep above the ground-floor walls is destroyed, and the rubbish
    conceals the exterior wall face, but the whole is clearly of excellent
    ashlar. From and within the west wall a small mural stair descends,
    turning the south-west angle to a door in the south wall, opening into
    the west vault. This door has a flat segmental arch. The outer entrance
    seems to have been in the west wall in the floor above the basement. It
    is said that an exterior stone stair is concealed by the rubbish. This
    keep stands upon the rock, here, perhaps, 20 feet above the rest of
    the area. It blocks up the triangular, or rather segmental inner ward,
    standing about 50 feet from one angle and 30 feet from the other. Its
    salient extends to within 10 feet of the northern, or corresponding
    salient of the ward, and its southern face is about 6 feet within
    the cross wall. In the curved outer wall of this ward, towards the
    north-west, is a very remarkable window recess, 8 feet broad and
    of the same height, to the plain Norman abacus, whence springs its
    round-headed arch, over which is a hood-moulding of the same pattern,
    the only attempt at ornament. The wall here is 8 feet thick, but as the
    outer 2 feet are not original, the window-case is gone. It was probably
    of two lights, and opened upon the cliff.</p>

  <p>Close south of this window, in the inner face of the same wall, are a
    number of curious holes, irregularly placed, more or less rounded, as
    though half a soda-water bottle had been thrust into the green mortar.
    They occur at the joints, and the best marked are where three joints
    meet. They are certainly not putlog holes, being too irregular and too
    shallow.</p>

  <p>The inner ward was entered from the outer by a small strong doorway in
    the cross wall, now much ruined, a few feet west of the keep.</p>

  <p>The outer ward had probably a chapel on its south side; many graves,
    some covered with slabs, and one containing a stone coffin, having
    been laid open when baring for the quarry. In the west wall is a good
    plain Caernarvon-headed postern door of 5 feet opening, below a pointed
    relieving arch. The main entrance to this ward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> was on the east side,
    near the inner ward wall, and commanded by the keep. The gateway, said
    to have been 15 feet deep, is now a ruin, but it opened upon a small
    platform, a little lower than the ward, and defended by a wall, under
    cover of which the road wound up from below. Some broken ground on this
    side is said to indicate an ancient quarry, probably that employed when
    the castle was built.</p>

  <p>On the north-west quarter was also a spur from the hill, but lower
    and narrower than the former one. This has been converted into a thin
    falciform bank, concave to the castle, by the cutting of a deep ditch
    in its rear, probably to provide a covered way to the postern, up which
    cattle could be driven with safety.</p>

  <p>The castle hill seems to have been girt, a few yards from its base, by
    a wet ditch, in part artificial, which covered its north-west and south
    sides, and communicated at each end with the Wansbeck, which completed
    the circle on the east side. Whether there was a wall within the ditch
    is uncertain, probably not, but it was guarded towards the north-east
    by a gatehouse and enclosed space, in front of which, below the present
    bridge, was the old fosse-bridge, by the tenure of guarding which
    Walter de Swinhowe, in the reign of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, held forty acres of
    land.</p>

  <p>A knoll so defined as Mitford, so secluded, and so protected by a river
    and by marshy ground, was likely to have been a British camp as well as
    a Saxon or English dwelling-place, and there is high probability of the
    truth of the tradition that asserts the Barony of Mitford to have been
    held in the reign of the Confessor by John of Mitford, whose daughter
    Sybil is said to have carried it in marriage to Richard Bertram, a
    follower of the Conqueror, and of the stock of Baliol. The first
    recorded lord is, however, Roger Bertram, who held the Barony in 1155,
    and certified to its having been held by his father and grandfather. At
    that time the Barony extended over five parishes, and received payment
    of castle-guard from nine manors, itself paying scutage to the castle
    of Newcastle.</p>

  <p>The Bertrams who, like the Baliols, bore an orle for their arms,
    retained Mitford for eight generations, when Agnes, their heiress, sold
    the estate, in 1275, to Alexander de Baliol, from whom it passed by
    various changes to de Valence, and thence with part of his estate to
    the Earl of Athol, one of his heirs general. There remained, however,
    in the district a family who bore the surname of Mitford, and claimed
    descent from a brother of John, whose daughter married the Bertram.
    Their representative, William, in the tenth generation, held lands in,
    and his son was actually of Mitford, and seems to have recovered the
    castle, and to be the direct ancestor in the male line of the present
    Mr. Mitford, of Mitford, and of his distant kinsman, Lord Redesdale.</p>

  <p>The castle, though of no great magnitude, played, from its position
    and strength, rather an important part in Border warfare. William the
    Lion, who reigned from 1165 to 1214, dated a charter from hence, 28th
    December, 1215. King John is said to have burned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> the vill, though
    whether he took the castle is unknown. The public records, however,
    make him visit Mitford from Berwick in 1216, and stay there the 24th,
    25th, and 26th of January, going on the latter day to Newcastle.
    Alexander, King of Scotland, failed to take the place in May, 1217,
    when he lay in leaguer before it for seven days. Local history is
    silent concerning it during the active reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, but in the
    wild times consequent upon Bannockburn, a notorious Border freebooter,
    Sir Gilbert Middleton, made Mitford his stronghold, and here imprisoned
    Henry, Lord Beaumont, while his brother Lewis, Bishop of Durham, was
    shut up in Morpeth Castle.</p>

  <p>The castle, by its present condition, affords evidence of the
    vicissitudes it has undergone. Still, ruined as it is, careful
    observation finds much from which its original plan, and even part of
    its details, may be ascertained. Its general plan, the keep, and the
    most part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall, are evidently original, and
    late Norman, probably the work of Richard Bertram early in the reign
    of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> The postern is, of course, later, either early Edwardian
    or of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> It is unusual to find so small a keep
    divided by a cross-wall, or to find any Norman keep with an original
    vaulted basement, though of this there is apparently an example in
    the late Norman Keep of Norham. The salient on one side is unknown
    elsewhere.</p>

  <p>A good ground-plan and photographs on a large scale of the masonry are
    much needed, and a very moderate amount of excavation in the inner ward
    would probably throw light on the original structure of the keep. In
    point of recorded history the very complete account of Mitford, given
    in Hodgson‚Äôs ‚ÄúNorthumberland,‚Äù leaves nothing to be desired; it is only
    to be regretted that a corresponding industry and critical acumen have
    not been brought to bear upon its architectural remains.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT is by a singular chance that a rude and artificial mound of earth,
    in an obscure part of a foreign province, should have given its name
    to a British county and to the town that forms its capital. The proper
    names of places in Britain are usually either British or English.
    Once given in the latter tongue, they have but seldom been changed.
    New creations, as Battle and Jervaulx, and some other ecclesiastical
    houses, bear, indeed, new names; but these do not appear to have
    displaced any already existing. Pontefract is a name probably derived
    from an accidental circumstance; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span> Richmond and Montgomery are
    solitary instances of a shire or a capital town deriving its name from
    the inheritance of a Norman lord.</p>

  <p>The castle of Montgomery is registered by that name in the Domesday
    survey, and placed in the hundred of Wintentrue, in the county of
    Salop. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Ad castellum de Montgomeri habet comes iiii carucas et vi
    libras denariorum. habet de uno fine de Walis pertinente ad ipsam
    castellariam. Rogerius [Corbet] habet ibi ij carucas, et de Walis, cum
    fratre suo habet xl. solidos.</span>‚Äù And further on, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Ipse comes construxit
    castrum, Muntgumeri vocatum. Ad quod adjacent lii. hid√¶ et dimidia quas
    tenuere Seuuar, Oslac, Azor, de rege Edwardo, quietas ab omni geldo;
    ad venandum eas habuere</span>.‚Äù Here, then, we have the name of the castle,
    its inclusion in an English county, its castelry, its chief lord, Earl
    Roger, and the fact that in the time of the Confessor, three Englishmen
    held 52¬Ω hides about it as a hunting-ground. The Englishmen are
    entered, a few lines on, as Thanes. Seuuar was, no doubt, like Siward,
    a very great, as was Azor a considerable, landowner in the same county.
    ‚ÄúDe fine de Walis‚Äù shows that Earl Roger‚Äôs territory included Welshmen
    with his English tenants, just as the names of places, and especially
    of parishes, in the district, show a great and early establishment of
    English there. The castelry included twenty-two members, at no great
    distance from the castle rock, and the castle was one of about fourteen
    strong places mentioned in Domesday as then existing in Hereford,
    Monmouth, and Salop. It only differed from most others, and especially
    from such as Clun, Ludlow, Caus, Oswestry, or Whittington, in being
    held by the earl himself, and not by one of his secondary barons.</p>

  <p>Earl Roger, the ‚Äúcomes‚Äù of the above entry, upon the fall of Morkere,
    added Shropshire to his Sussex earldom, and to him, with powers equal
    in many respects to those of royalty, was committed the safety of the
    middle march, with its extensive but imperilled English settlement
    there. On the site of the British Pengwern and of the Saxon Shrobsbury,
    folded securely within a remarkable convolution of the Severn, he
    established his chief seat upon, and at the base of, the English mound,
    which still looks down upon the deep and wide river; and with its
    connected fragment of the ancient city wall forms a striking contrast
    to the bustle and action carried out upon the railway and within its
    ephemeral buildings at the foot of the slope. There is a tradition,
    founded, however, upon error, that the earl‚Äôs lieutenant in the more
    advanced frontier of his dangerous territory, was a certain Baldwin,
    whose name is preserved in the Welsh appellation of Tre-Faldwin for
    the town and castle, and of Frydd-Faldwin for a remarkable encampment
    on the summit of an adjacent hill. But Baldwin, though not an uncommon
    name with the Normans, does not occur in Shropshire among either the
    tenants-in-chief or the under-tenants, in Domesday. There was indeed a
    William Fitz-Baldwin, Lord of Rhydcors, in the reign of Rufus, but he
    was a South Wales man, and unconnected with Earl Roger. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> whether
    as Tre-Faldwin or Montgomery, whether named from the hand or the head,
    it is clear that the castle stood in a position most offensive to the
    pride and patriotic feelings of the Welsh. The vale of the Severn from
    Welsh Pool to a little short of Llanidloes, had for centuries been a
    field of bitter contest. The Roman, the Dane, and the Englishman had
    done violence to the ‚Äúvirgin daughter of Locrine,‚Äù and stained her
    molten crystal with blood. Its broad band of flat and fertile meadow
    made Powys-land a prize of great value, and the steep and lofty hills
    between which it was contained, were highly favourable to both the
    sudden attack and safe retreat of the Welsh. The plain and its lower
    eminences, traversed by the dyke of Offa, are thickly studded with
    moated mounds and earthworks, thrown up in the eighth, ninth, and
    tenth centuries, and which show how far-reaching was, even in that
    remote period, the Mercian and English power. The mound thrown up by
    √Üthelflaed in 916, at Chirbury, is destroyed; but those of Moat Lane,
    of Newtown, of H√™n-domen, of Kerry, and Nant-cribba, remain, and are
    as large and as well-defined as that of Shrewsbury itself, and of
    the very type of those more famous royal residences in Elmete and at
    Laughton-en-le-Morthen, or of the works near Livarot, whence Earl Roger
    derived his name, and which have survived all subsequent additions in
    stone and lime.</p>

  <p>That Earl Roger, between his acquisition of the earldom and the year
    of the Domesday survey had built a castle, is on record, but what sort
    of a castle may be a question. Norman towers were plain, solid, of
    durable design, and excellent workmanship, too stout and too useful
    to be intentionally pulled down, and usually, as at Wattlesborough,
    outlasting all later additions; but assuredly there is now no trace of
    any work of Earl Roger on the castle rock, nor anywhere near it; for
    it has been supposed, without shadow of probability, that his castle
    was placed, not upon the rock, but somewhere in its neighbourhood. It
    seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that Earl Roger‚Äôs castle was
    of a less durable character than is usually supposed, and that this
    will account for its quick destruction in 1095, two years after his
    death, by the Welsh, accompanied by the slaughter of his successor‚Äôs
    (Earl Hugh) garrison. This was the event that brought Rufus into the
    district, to the earl‚Äôs aid, in 1096, when, though he did but little,
    he seems to have recovered the site of the castle, and to have given
    the earl an opportunity of rebuilding or restoring it. Earl Hugh is
    said to have done so, but however this may have been, Montgomery is not
    mentioned among the castles held by his elder brother, but successor,
    Robert de Belesme, the wicked earl, on his ruin and banishment in 1102.
    Here, again, the probability is that any castle then standing was of
    a light and not very durable character, not worthy of being mentioned
    with Shrewsbury or Bridgenorth.</p>

  <p>With the fall of the house of Montgomery, the earldom escheated to
    the Crown, and with it its castle and castelry. Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> upon this
    remodelled the hundreds of Salop, and raised Montgomery into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> an Honour
    or barony, throwing into it the greater part of the adjacent seignory
    of Chirbury, and several other manors. The valuable, and, on the whole,
    compact territory thus constituted was at once granted by Henry to
    a certain Baldwin de Bollers, who was the husband ‚Äú<span lang="la">Sibill√¶ nepotis
    regis</span>,‚Äù whatever relationship, legitimate or illegitimate, that word
    may indicate. This lady is also designated, possibly from her mother,
    as ‚ÄúSibil de Faleise.‚Äù All that is known of Baldwin is that he already
    held five knight‚Äôs-fees of the honour of Warden. He held the new
    Honour, <i lang="la">in capite</i>, of the king, per baroniam; his under-tenants
    holding of him, most of them, as set forth in the Hundred Rolls, by
    castle guard. Baldwin began his reign by the very necessary act of
    building a castle, though what he actually constructed is uncertain,
    for there is no existing masonry that can be attributed to him or his
    immediate successors. Still, he is reported to have built a castle, and
    that he did so is probably just as certain that it is his name, and not
    that of any lieutenant of Earl Roger, that is identified with the rock
    by the Welsh. It is also reported that while Baldwin was preparing this
    castle, he occupied the British camp above, known, in consequence, as
    Ffrydd-Faldwin. This is most improbable. The camp, a very large and
    very fine specimen of a British work, would hold five or six thousand
    men, and could not well be defended by less than a third of that
    number, for its front is extensive, and its slopes, though steep, are
    by no means so steep as to stop, or materially to check the onset of
    a tribe of light-armed mountaineers. Baldwin‚Äôs force was more likely
    to be 500 than 5,000 men, and no doubt depended for its power far more
    upon its arms and discipline than upon its numerical strength. The
    castle rock would have held such a force with great security while the
    operations of a castle were in progress, and probably did so.</p>

  <p>The descendants of De Bollers, incorrectly given by Dugdale, have been
    disentangled by Mr. Eyton, the real historian of Montgomery, with his
    usual patience and skill, and seem to be as follows:‚Äî</p>

  <p>Baldwin de Bollers, Lord of Montgomery, 1121, married, (1) Sibil
    de Faleise, and had also a second wife. By Sibil he had Stephen de
    Bollers, 1160, Lord of Montgomery, who married Maria, and had Robert,
    who died young. Matilda, Sibil‚Äôs daughter, married Richard Fitz-Urse,
    1130‚Äì58, and had Reginald Fitz-Urse, one of Becket‚Äôs murderers, and
    Margery.</p>

  <p>On Stephen‚Äôs death the Honour seems to have passed to Almeric de
    Bollers, probably a son or descendant of Baldwin, by his second
    wife, and who had it in 1162. He was succeeded by Robert de Bollers,
    1176‚Äì1203, who died childless, but left a widow, Hilaria Trusbut, who
    had dower till 1241. The heir was Robert‚Äôs brother, Baldwin, 1203‚Äì7,
    who also died childless, and whose widow, Wenllian Tet, had dower till
    1243. This ended the male line.</p>

  <p>The next heirs were the Fitz-Urses. Reginald, Becket‚Äôs murderer,
    had a daughter and heiress, who married Robert, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> William de
    Courtenay, Lord of Montgomery, who died 1214, childless, leaving Ada a
    widow with dower, who died 1217. The next heir was the descendant of
    Margery, sister of Reginald Fitz-Urse, who married Richard Engaine,
    1177‚Äì85, and had Richard, 1185, father of Vitalis Engaine, 1217, who
    claimed the Honour on the death of William de Courtenay, but only
    obtained a portion of it. Thomas de Erdington was a rival and more
    successful claimant. He held the castle, 1215‚Äì18, but much of the
    Honour was granted, in 1216, to William de Cantilupe, with certain
    reservations. In 1225 the king, who had all along treated the castle as
    a royal fortress, claimed the Honour as an escheat, and the whole was
    taken by the Crown, the dowers being allowed. Erdington, who had been
    the custos of the king‚Äôs castles of Shrewsbury, Whitchurch, Shawardine,
    Morton, Clun, Montgomery, Moreton, and other Shropshire strongholds,
    was repaid the outlay he had made upon them. Some sort of castle
    undoubtedly occupied the rock of Montgomery between 1102 and 1225, and
    it is said to have been twice taken and destroyed by Llewelyn, who, on
    the death of John, gained some advantages in Wales, and was allowed
    the custody of all the land that had belonged to Gwenonwhyn in ‚ÄúWales
    and Mungumer,‚Äù of which he had been disseized during the war between
    John and the Barons. This he was to hold till Gwenonwhyn came of age.
    Probably the result was that when Henry entered he found the rock laid
    bare, for, from that time the Sheriff‚Äôs accounts show annual and very
    considerable payments for military works there for many years, and we
    read of the king‚Äôs new castle of Montgomery. As early as 1225, when
    the Welsh war made the place of great importance, nearly ¬£1,000 is
    paid out; ¬£1,100 in 1224; and above ¬£500 in 1225. Master carpenters
    are sent to construct defences of timber, <i lang="fr">br√©tasches</i>, to
    strengthen the castle, and miners or quarrymen from the Forest of Dean,
    no doubt to prepare stone, and to hew out the cross ditches. A fit
    chaplain is to be appointed to serve in the castle chapel, under the
    parson of Montgomery, and the king is to decide about the emoluments
    or ‚Äúobventions‚Äù of the chantry. These were afterwards allotted to the
    mother Church, that is to the parish church of Montgomery, which was
    the mother church of the chapel; of the whole district Chirbury was
    the mother church. To the parson was also given the corn tythe of the
    land newly cultivated, of which he already had the small tythe. Sums of
    money are also allowed for assisting in clearing the lands of underwood
    and harbours for robbers; and on one occasion the king alludes to the
    time ‚Äúwhen we took in hand our castle of Montgomery.‚Äù Henry himself was
    there in 1224, and all the masonry now standing is pretty evidently his
    work, and of this period.</p>

  <p>1223 was the year of Llewelyn‚Äôs submission, and Godescal de Maghelines
    was castellan, and received drafts of miners and carpenters, and
    quarrels from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Briavel‚Äôs forges. Henry, the king‚Äôs brother, and
    other knights, formed the garrison; and the chapel was in use.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

  <p>In 1224 the king granted an annual fair in ‚Äúour manor of Montgomery,‚Äù
    and Hubert de Huse was coupled with Godescal as custodes of the castle,
    honour, and vale of Montgomery, and soon after Baldwin de Hodnet
    was seneschal, and William de Cantelupe had seizin of the fees of
    the knights and free tenants annexed to the Honour. A fair was also
    proclaimed to be held under the castle, and protections were granted to
    those attending.</p>

  <p>In 1227 Henry changed his policy, and granted the castle to Hubert
    de Burgh, with 200 marcs yearly for its custody for life, and an
    augmentation in war time, which speedily occurred; for in 1230,
    Llewelyn, having hanged William de Braose, marched towards Montgomery,
    the garrison of which suffered from an ambuscade near Kerry, whither
    they had gone to cut down a large wood. The Welsh followed them to
    the castle, and besieged it. Henry came to their relief. In 1233 de
    Burgh lost Henry‚Äôs favour, and with it Montgomery, and a constable
    was appointed by the king. A windmill was erected near the castle, to
    grind for its use. In 1235, a tower beyond the castle wall had been
    repaired, as had the town walls, for which nine wooden turrets were
    provided. Wine and various stores were sent to the castle, which, in
    1245, was attacked by the Welsh under David, and, notwithstanding
    all the money so recently spent upon it, was found not to be in good
    repair, as appears from an inquisition held upon it in 1249, which
    specifies particularly the donjon or keep; the chamber and chapel; the
    wooden turret or <i lang="fr">br√©tasche</i>, and the bridge near the chapel; the
    balister‚Äôs house; the wooden turret next the town; the stable; the
    wooden turret beyond the outer gate; the grange and wall round it; the
    pentiscie, pent-houses, or lean-to‚Äôs, carrying the woodwork belonging
    to five wooden turrets; the small tower or garrit, outside the gate;
    the ‚Äúbarrier‚Äù (jurullum) near the chapel; and the porter‚Äôs lodge. For
    the repairs of these is wanted ¬£59. 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> At this time there is also
    a water-mill connected with the castle, ‚ÄúStanlawes Mill,‚Äù which only
    worked in winter.</p>

  <p>In 1254 Henry granted Montgomery to Prince Edward, who, with the
    consent of the king and council, appointed a custos. In 1264, after
    Lewes, Henry, then in durance, ordered Adam Fitz-Philip to surrender
    the castle. Adam, however, refused, unless the order was backed by
    Prince Edward. In 1267, 29th September, Henry was here, and received
    Llewelyn‚Äôs homage, and recognised his principality, for which he was to
    pay 30,000 marcs.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> let the castle in farm to Bogo de Knovill, for ¬£40 per
    annum, which rent was mostly expended upon the town defences, the
    town being a royal borough, under a charter from Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, in 1227,
    strengthened by one from Hubert de Burgh, by which leave was given to
    enclose it within a wall and ditch, of which the four gates remained in
    Leland‚Äôs days. In 1274 Prince Llewelyn was summoned to meet Edward‚Äôs
    Commissioners at the ford of Montgomery, a favourite trysting-place in
    that reign: but the Welsh prince did not attend.</p>

  <p>The reduction of the principality by Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> necessarily destroyed
    the value of the castles along the march, as bulwarks against the
    Welsh, and the strong domestic government of that sovereign put an
    end to the continued rebellions of the Marcher Barons. Under these
    circumstances the border castles were either allowed to fall into
    decay, or were employed only as county prisons. In any case they had
    little or no military value; nor, with the exception of a few passages
    in the reign of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and for a while, during the Glendower
    rebellion, were they regarded as defensible or so employed. Long
    afterwards, indeed, during the wars of Charles and his Parliament,
    such of these castles as remained tolerably perfect were garrisoned,
    defended, usually taken and retaken, and finally slighted or blown
    up by the prevailing party. Montgomery seems to have had its share
    of these misfortunes, and no doubt its walls and towers suffered;
    but in all probability, here, as elsewhere, far more damage has been
    done by the use of the ruins as a quarry in modern times of peace and
    prosperity than by the violence attendant upon war. Here, as in most
    other border castles, the military history of the building closes with
    the reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, up to which point, or nearly so, all that can
    be said of the castelry, honour, and descent of the castle, has been
    collected from the original records, combined, digested, and recorded
    by Mr. Eyton, in his admirable ‚ÄúHistory of Salop.‚Äù For the later
    history of the castle, may be read with advantage a paper by the Rev.
    George Sanford, recently printed in the Montgomery Transactions.</p>

  <p>The position of Montgomery Castle is formed by nature, and needed only
    to be seen to be recognised as very suitable for a border fortress. A
    narrow and lofty ridge of rock, lying nearly north and south, rises
    abruptly between two valleys; that to the east very suitable for
    the town which has sprung up within it; that to the west, narrower
    and equally steep, but rising on its further side to far loftier
    elevations, one of which is crowned by the encampment of Frydd-Faldwin,
    and the other, rather lower and more to the south, is occupied by a
    much smaller work of very different, and, probably, English type.
    The ridge is in length about 500 yards, and that part of its summit
    occupied by the castle and its works about 330 yards. Its greatest
    breadth is about 60 yards, of which the castle may occupy about 40
    yards. The ridge is reached from the south-east, or town quarter, by
    a steep road, but towards the north it terminates in a sharp point,
    whence a very steep slope falls to the top of a cliff of rock, the
    whole height being perhaps 250 feet. The contiguous sides are also
    very steep, so much so that a stone set rolling from the top does not
    stop till it reaches the gardens and orchards 150 feet or more below.
    The parish church stands within the town upon an eminence opposite to,
    but lower than the castle. The view from the ridge extends over the
    plain of the Severn to the Welsh mountains in one direction, and to the
    Shropshire hills in the other. Below, in the direction of Chirbury,
    Offa‚Äôs Dyke may be discerned about a mile distant, the castle being
    upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> its outer or Welsh side. The ridge is traversed by three ditches
    quarried in the rock, and dividing it into four platforms, which
    formed the four wards of the castle, each of which appears to have
    been enclosed by walls or palisades, and connected with the others by
    bridges of timber. The northern and strongest ward is also by some
    feet the highest ward, and formed the donjon, or citadel; keep there
    was certainly none. This ward was about 52 yards north and south, by
    32 yards east and west. It is nearly rectangular, and its four faces
    are scarped and revetted, that portion of the wall being about 15 feet
    high. Upon this stood the curtain and the outer walls of the contained
    buildings. A considerable building stood on the west face, along the
    southern half of which a wall remains about 9 thick, which supported a
    basement and two upper floors, of which holes for the joists are seen.
    In the first floor is a recess with a window and two garderobes, with
    shafts in the wall. The window was pointed, and that is all that can
    be ascertained. In the upper floor is also a garderobe. Connected with
    this fragment of wall is half a horseshoe tower, 30 feet in diameter,
    projected 25 feet from the wall. This also had a basement, and two
    upper floors, but little of it now remains. In the outer side of its
    wall, to the north, are the remains of another garderobe shaft, and,
    high up, part of a straight mural staircase. From hence, northwards, is
    a mere curtain. On the three other faces only the revetment, or traces
    of it, remain. A heap of rubbish at the south end may be the foundation
    of the gatehouse. There is no trace of a well, hall, or chapel. The
    only ashlar remaining is a sort of quoin in the substance of the great
    wall, and in a window jamb in the horseshoe tower. The masonry is rude
    but coursed rubble.</p>

  <p>Between this and the third ward was a ditch about 20 yards broad,
    dammed up at its lower or west end to form a pond, probably for
    the benefit of the castle cattle. There is no trace of a bridge of
    masonry here. The third ward is a regular oblong, carefully scarped,
    and probably revetted all round. Only the eastern face is visible,
    and there the wall is about 20 feet high, with the remains of three
    half-round solid buttresses, 6 feet in diameter, and something like
    traces of two more. There is no masonry above the surface of the
    platform, which is about 40 yards north and south by 35 yards east and
    west. A ditch of about 8 yards broad divided it from the second ward.</p>

  <p>The second ward is roughly oval, about 50 yards long by 30 yards broad,
    and its southern end is occupied by a rocky mound. There is no trace
    of masonry connected with this ward, which may have been defended
    with timber. The ditch dividing this from the first ward is not above
    4 yards or 5 yards broad, and very irregular, the depression being
    apparently in part natural.</p>

  <p>The first ward is smaller than the rest, irregular and rocky. It bears
    traces of dry walling, and upon its platform are the foundations of
    a rectangular building, and at the south end of a sort of tower,
    indicated only by a heap of earth. It may have been about 25 yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span> by
    15 yards. It may be that the first and second wards were merely natural
    platforms palisaded with timber <i lang="fr">br√©tasches</i>, as they are called
    in the close roll, but the third and fourth wards were certainly walled
    and must have been strong. To the north, 20 feet to 30 feet beyond,
    below the north ward, is a level triangular platform of turf about 60
    yards in the side, and protected by a light bank on which may have been
    a fence. This platform, by nature so strong, was probably intended for
    a pasture for cattle. At the other or south end is also a platform, 20
    feet or 10 feet below the level of the first ward, and now occupied by
    a cottage. Here was the entrance, which probably was covered by some
    sort of tower, protected in advance by a palisade.</p>

  <p>Scanty as are the remains of this castle, it may safely be concluded
    that they present no masonry of Norman date, whether early or late.
    The plan of the works is, of course, dictated by the natural outline
    of the rock, and it therein resembles Bere, though that is a little
    earlier than Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and Dolforwyn, probably a work of that king‚Äôs
    reign. Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>‚Äôs border castles had no keep. They were mostly mere
    enclosures, the curtains being set rather thick with towers.</p>

  <p>Altogether this castle, as it now stands, seems to be the new
    castle referred to by Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and built early in his reign, nor
    is there any trace of any earlier work, although there is every
    reason to believe that such there was, and that it or they stood on
    this site. Moreover, as to these earlier works, tempting as is the
    position, there is nothing in the way of earthwork upon it which can
    be safely attributed either to the Welsh or the English. That Earl
    Roger constructed a castle of some kind at or near the present site
    is certain, and it is very improbable indeed that with a position so
    convenient, and made so strong by nature, he should have selected any
    other, nor is there in the immediate neighbourhood any trace of any
    other work likely to have been constructed later than the Conquest.</p>

  <p>It has been mentioned that the borough of Montgomery had licence, in
    the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, to enclose the town within a wall and ditch,
    and although gates and ditches do not necessarily imply the more
    costly addition of a wall of masonry, it is certain that the town was
    fortified, and Mr. Sandford‚Äôs view of 1610 shows a wall including an
    area somewhat wider than the present town, and, what is very unusual,
    this wall includes the castle, instead of the castle forming a part of
    the circuit. No traces of any wall of masonry are known to exist, but
    outside it, to the west, and at the foot of the slopes of the castle,
    is a bank with a ditch, looking very much like a local dyke of the age
    of that of Offa, but which is reputed to be what remains of the town
    wall. The curious thing is that this dyke, which, while opposite to
    the castle is commanded and therefore strengthened by the castle rock,
    passes southwards along the steep slope of an opposite hill, and is
    there commanded from the outside, and would be utterly untenable. This
    is often the case with Offa‚Äôs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> dyke, which, though laid out with a bank
    and outer ditch, was really rather a boundary than intended at every
    point for defence. Its defence was obviously the general fear of the
    Mercian power, rather than the apprehension of an armed force at every
    point along its line. It may be that the town wall was placed upon this
    bank, but the bank itself seems older and part of an earlier boundary.</p>

  <p>For the plan and section of the castle and castle rock which accompany
    this paper, and add materially to any little value that it may possess,
    the author and his readers are indebted to the skill and kindness of
    Mr. Mikleburgh, of Montgomery.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="MORLAIS_CASTLE_GLAMORGAN">MORLAIS CASTLE, GLAMORGAN.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">UPON the northern limits of the county of Glamorgan, and above the
    eastern and lesser of the two sources of the Taff, stand the ruins
    of the castle of Morlais, so called from a small brook which rises a
    little to its north-east, and which, after receiving the Dowlais, flows
    into the Taff, within the adjacent town of Merthyr.</p>

  <p>The castle is placed upon the edge of a considerable platform of
    mountain limestone rock, quarried extensively during the present
    century for the neighbouring ironworks, and about 470 feet above
    the Taff Vechan, which, descending through a steep and narrow gorge
    of considerable beauty, the boundary of the ancient districts of
    Brecheinioc and Morganwg, as of the modern counties of Brecknock and
    Glamorgan, escapes below the castle, through the defile and over the
    fall of Pont Sarn, to join the Taff a little above Merthyr.</p>

  <p>The position, strong upon the north and west, is open upon the east
    and south; thus, in its want of complete natural defences, resembling
    in position the Norman castles rather than the Celtic or Saxon camps.
    It commands an extensive view over much of the upper Taff, and of
    the Merthyr basin, and was, on the whole, well placed to guard this
    frontier of Glamorgan against the inland tribes, to give notice of
    their approach to the garrisons of the plain, and to cut off any
    spoilers who, having invaded the vale, might be returning by this route
    to their native fastnesses.</p>

  <p>The ancient trackway of Heol Adda, still a parish road, the shortest,
    and within memory the ordinary, way from Gelligaer and Merthyr to
    Brecon, passes about half a mile north-east of the castle, and was
    completely commanded by it.</p>

  <p>The ground-plan of Morlais is very simple. A court, of an irregular
    oval shape, 140 yards north and south, by 60 yards east and west,
    is enclosed within an embattled wall capped by five or six circular
    towers, and encompassed on the north, east, and south sides by a moat,
    discontinued on the west side, which was always steep, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>though
    recently quarried into a cliff. The only remaining entrance to the
    court is on the east side, through a narrow archway in the curtain,
    which could only have admitted infantry, and which is approached by a
    steep path and a causeway across the moat. A broader causeway across
    the moat at its south end seems to have led to a larger gateway,
    probably commanded by a tower, connected by a curtain with the main
    wall; but this gateway, if it ever existed, is completely buried
    beneath the ruins.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The court seems to have been divided by a wall into a northern and
    southern portion, in the latter of which is the well.</p>

  <p>Proceeding to details, A is the southern or keep tower, of two
    stories. The lower, a polygon of twelve sides, 28 feet in diameter,
    has a central column, with corresponding facets, branching into
    twelve fan-ribs, which, forming pointed arches, support the roof, and
    terminate on the containing wall in as many pilasters. The ribs are
    of limestone, but the upfilling of the vault is of a calcareous tufa,
    light, and very strong, and found <i lang="la">in situ</i> below a calcareous
    spring on the Heol Adda road, towards Pont-Sticcill. The whole chamber,
    though extremely elegant, is quite plain, the mouldings being a mere
    chamfer with no other decoration. There are neither windows nor loops,
    and the entrance is by an acute lancet-headed doorway, 5 feet wide by
    13 feet high, which occupies the northern facet, and is approached
    from the court by a descending flight of steps. The upper chamber was
    probably not vaulted. Like Castell Coch, it seems to have contained
    several large fireplaces, as well as a garderobe chamber. It was
    approached by a winding stair, which appears to have terminated below
    upon a sort of drawbridge across the stairs leading to the crypt, and
    thus to have communicated with the eastern walls by another stair,
    exterior to the tower, and also leading to its battlements. In the
    curtain wall, close north-east of the keep, is a singular cavity, the
    use of which, if one it had, has not been discovered.</p>

  <p>The opposite or northern tower, B, was of much less elaborate
    construction. It appears to have been a mere shell, 37 feet in internal
    diameter, of two stories, divided by a timber floor, entered below from
    the court on the level, and above probably by a winding stair on its
    north-east side, communicating also with the ramparts of the eastern
    curtain.</p>

  <p>The east entrance, I, 5 feet broad, which was provided with a
    portcullis, and had a sharply-pointed arch, destroyed about twenty
    years ago, is placed between two smaller drum-towers, C and D, about
    16 feet in diameter, each with its subsidiary well-stair. The northern
    tower, close to the door, completely commanded its exterior, and the
    southern, at some distance from the door, but nearly opposite to the
    causeway, K, commanded that passage, and the steep way up to the gate.</p>

  <p>The western wall, probably 6 feet thick, was altogether weaker than
    the eastern, which was about 12 feet, and instead of two, it seems to
    have contained but one tower, a chamber of, or perhaps a drain from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
    which, still remains. South-west of the keep are two heaps of rubbish
    which evidently indicate the position of two towers, one upon the
    curtain, and the other some way in advance, which latter seems to have
    terminated a sort of spur wall, projecting 60 feet from the curtain,
    and intended to cover the principal entrance by the southern causeway.</p>

  <p>The well, N, is a singular excavation, rough and unlined, 27 feet
    square, and now about 44 feet deep. A few years ago it was partially
    filled up, and it is said before that to have been 70 feet deep.
    However this may be, it is certain that no water would be reached
    here at less than 400 feet, a depth which was not likely to have been
    attained. Close to the well, at O, is an oblong chamber, 44 feet by 24
    feet, with broad steps, which appears to have been a tank, probably
    for rain-water. Near this tank is an oval oven, 11 feet by 15 feet,
    very perfect, and, singularly enough, formed of limestone. Near to
    this are the foundations of the kitchen. The wall dividing the court
    crossed just north of the well, opposite to which are traces of a large
    bow, and east of this of a doorway. In the southern court, against
    the east wall, were ranges, probably of barracks, roofed with shingle
    or tile-stone, with leaden trimmings, the stones and lead having been
    turned up in the ruins. Near the well is a large heap of mixed iron
    slag, coal, charcoal, and clinker, probably from a smith‚Äôs forge, near
    to which fragments of iron have been found. The heap is evidently old,
    inasmuch as it contains crystals of selenite. It also contains chlorine
    and sodium in various combinations, proving, or thought to prove, that
    common salt has been used in the operations of the forge, or perhaps in
    smelting the ore here.</p>

  <p>The moat, which ranges from 14 yards to 40 yards from the walls, is
    about 40 feet broad and 14 feet deep, and its total length is about 370
    yards. It has been quarried out of the rock, and its contents no doubt
    were used in building the castle, which is almost wholly of limestone.</p>

  <p>In the moat, at Q, is a driftway, now much broken down, but which it is
    just possible may have been a private passage into the court. The area
    covered by the castle, measuring from the exterior edge of the moat, is
    about four acres.</p>

  <p>Exterior to the moat, at its south side, is a sort of semi-circular
    space inclosed within a mound, and probably intended for the protection
    of cattle. East of the moat are various holes and ruined inclosures,
    the former probably old places for burning lime, and the latter
    shepherds‚Äô huts and folds.</p>

  <p>This castle, in 1833, was partially excavated by Lady C. E. Guest,
    when a metal seal was discovered in an adjacent field. The legend
    is, <span class="smcap">s . inon . fili . howel . gor .</span>; but the names of Einon
    and Howell are exceedingly common in Glamorgan pedigrees, and the
    concluding abbreviation, no doubt a distinguishing cognomen, has not
    been explained, unless it may be read ‚ÄúGoch‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Red.‚Äù Coins have
    also been occasionally picked up. Very recently there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> were found
    together several silver pennies of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and one of Alexander <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>
    of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The castle at this time is a ruin, only the mere outline of the walls,
    and the <i lang="fr">d√©bris</i> of the towers remaining. The keep alone is above
    ground. The foundations are, however, tolerably perfect, and have been
    excavated and traced very recently with a view to the annexed plan.
    There is reason, from the disposition of the rubbish, to infer that
    the walls and towers were regularly pulled down from the top, and not,
    as usual in later days, blown up; so that the castle was probably
    deserted and dismantled at an early period. Mr. Stephens, whose general
    authority is in this instance strengthened by accurate local knowledge,
    was of opinion that this castle was never completed; and this may
    certainly have been the case.</p>

  <p>In the course of the recent excavations a few discoveries were made.
    The oven was before unknown, as were the staircases of the two eastern
    towers, and the chambers in the wall of the upper story of the keep,
    and in the western wall. Very many cut stones, parts of door and
    window-cases, brackets, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, were dug up, but all were perfectly plain,
    having only the chamfer moulding.</p>

  <p>The brothers Buck engraved a view of Morlais from the north-west in the
    last century, which shows the keep, and a small part of the curtain, in
    a much more perfect state than at present.</p>

  <p>The details of Morlais, though good, are, as became an obscure castle,
    so bare of ornament that it is difficult to refer the building to
    any precise date. Still the general proportions of the openings, the
    character of the crypt, and, perhaps, the general plan of the building,
    point with tolerable certainty to the latter period of the early
    English style, or the close of the thirteenth century, as about the
    time of its construction.</p>

  <p>The history of Morlais is scanty, but it corroborates the internal
    evidence supplied by its architecture, and connects it with one of the
    most remarkable legal struggles between the Crown and the lords of the
    Welsh marches.</p>

  <p>It appears from the public records that, towards the middle of the
    reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, a quarrel arose between Gilbert de Clare, the Red
    Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, Lord of Glamorgan, and Humphrey de
    Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex, Constable of England and Lord of
    Brecknock. Both were powerful peers, and De Clare, during the quarrel,
    had married, 29th April, 18 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1290, Joan, the king‚Äôs daughter,
    while De Bohun‚Äôs wife, Maud de Fienles, was of kin to the queen. De
    Clare was the elder, and had the wardship of De Bohun.</p>

  <p>The cause of quarrel was a castle, which De Clare had built upon his
    frontier, and, it was said, upon land belonging to De Bohun. That
    Morlais was the disputed castle is certain from the general tenor of
    the evidence, and from the mention of Penderyn Church, which is near to
    no other fortified place to which the particulars given would apply.</p>

  <p>The trespass was the subject of a suit at law, and the king in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
    Parliament, eight days before the Purification of the Virgin, 18 Edward
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> (25th of January, 1290), gave a formal order to the two earls to
    abstain from hostilities. This order they disobeyed, and the new
    offence, of a far more serious nature than the original one, was at
    once noticed by the king, and the proceedings upon it are recapitulated
    with great minuteness in the parliamentary record, made on the occasion
    of the sentence, on the 7th January, 20 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1292.</p>

  <p>It appeared from the complaint of De Bohun, that De Clare‚Äôs retainers,
    headed by William de Valers, Richard le Fleming, and Stephen de
    Cappenore, with horse and foot, and the earl‚Äôs banner of arms
    displayed, had made three forays into Brecknock.</p>

  <p>The first time, on Friday (3rd February) after the Purification, 1290,
    marching from the contested ground, they entered two leagues; the
    second time on Monday (5th June), before <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Barnabas, five leagues;
    and the third time, on Monday (27th <abbr title="November">Novem.</abbr>), before <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew, they
    entered seven leagues.</p>

  <p>In these incursions they lifted and carried home 1070 head of cattle,
    50 farm horses and colts, and sheep, goats and swine unnumbered. Also
    they wasted the land, and killed several people. The damage was rated
    by a jury at ¬£100. Of the spoil, De Clare, according to the custom of
    marcher war, received one-third.</p>

  <p>On other occasions, following this example, the loose rogues, ‚Äú<span lang="la">latrones
    et esketores</span>,‚Äù of the district, perhaps some of those who gave name to
    ‚ÄúBwlch-y-Lladron‚Äù above Aberdare, and ‚ÄúRhyd-y-Milwr‚Äù above Rhymney,
    repeated the forays; and, besides other outrages, burned the house of
    ‚ÄúTyraph,‚Äù and the church of Penderyn, taking from the latter a chalice,
    certain ornaments, and other matters. The earl and his captains were
    not charged with any knowledge of, or share in, these robberies or
    sacrileges.</p>

  <p>It seems probable that the league (leuca) was not above an English
    mile, and that their depredations were confined to the south side of
    the Beacons. If so, that tract of country must have been at least
    as well stocked as it is now. And it may be doubted whether the
    modern church of Penderyn, with its hassocks and cassocks, and old
    prayer-books, would yield as much to any modern ‚Äúesketores.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Upon the receipt of this complaint, the king appointed by letters
    patent William de Luda Bishop of Ely, whom Nicholas calls Lord
    Chancellor (a statement unconfirmed by the very accurate Foss),
    William de Valence the king‚Äôs uncle, John de Mettingham the honest
    Chief Justice, and Robert de Hertford one of the judges of the Common
    Pleas, to inquire into the matter, and especially as to whether the
    outrages were committed after the royal inhibition. They were to summon
    witnesses from the counties of Hereford, Caermarthen, and Cardigan, and
    the parts of Gower, Ewyas, and Grosmont, and they were to report to the
    king by fifteen days from Easter (22d April), 1291.</p>

  <p>The sheriff of Berkshire was to summon the Earl of Gloucester, and
    Robert de Typetoft, justiciary of West Wales, was to summon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span> his
    captains. The sheriff of Hereford, the justiciary, Geoffrey de Genville
    and Theobald de Verdun bailiffs of Ewyas, and Edmund the king‚Äôs
    brother‚Äôs bailiff of Grosmont, were to provide the jury. Strathwelly,
    in Brecknock, was to be the place; and the Monday (12th March) after
    Quadragesima the time of meeting. Also, to prevent any collusion, the
    inquiry was to proceed, even should one of the parties withdraw.</p>

  <p>The following magnates were also summoned by the king as jurors: John
    de Hastings, John Fitz-Reginald, Edmund and Roger Mortimer, Theobald
    de Verdun, John Tregoz, William de Braose, Geoffrey de Cammill (no
    doubt ‚ÄúCamville,‚Äù), and Roger Pycheworth, together with the king‚Äôs
    Welsh seneschals, and his brother‚Äôs seneschals of Monmouth, Grosmont,
    Skenfrith, and Whitecastle. Also were summoned the sheriffs of Hereford
    and Gloucester, and the seneschal of Crickhowel, so as to provide a
    jury of twenty-four knights and others. The preparations were not
    unsuitable to the rank and power of the offenders, and to what it is
    clear our English Justinian regarded as the excessive heinousness of
    the offence.</p>

  <p>On the appointed Monday, Hastings, then Lord of Abergavenny, and his
    companions, met the commissioners at Brecknock, and were adjourned to
    Wednesday, at Laundon; but the commissioners proceeded the same day to
    Strathwelly, which they reached about three o‚Äôclock.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Hereford was punctual, but Gloucester and his captains were
    not forthcoming, though the sheriff and Typetoft proved their summons.
    It was, perhaps, the probability of this contumacy that had caused the
    previous adjournment to Laundon, to which place the commissioners next
    proceeded.</p>

  <p>Here, his opponents being still absent, the Earl of Hereford stated his
    complaint, and demanded an inquiry. Upon this the magnates were called
    upon to swear, placing their hands upon the book. Hastings and the rest
    unanimously refused compliance. Their ancestors, they said, in those
    parts, had never heard of a compulsory oath, except in certain march
    affairs, sanctioned by custom. They were admonished that the king‚Äôs
    power was supreme, but they still, each for himself, declined, without
    consulting their peers.</p>

  <p>The excuses of certain jurors were next stated. De Braose did not
    appear, because his lands were in the king‚Äôs hands. Pycheworth was
    a name unknown; but Pychard, who came, was not received. Genville
    had enfeoffed his son Peter with his Welsh lands. The seneschal of
    Abergavenny had received no summons. Certain Crickhowell jurors came
    unsummoned, as their seneschal testified. Roger de Mortimer held his
    Welsh lands under the Earl of Hereford, and of course could not act;
    and Edmund‚Äôs lands were far off, so no summons had found its way
    thither. From Tregoz and Camville came neither jurors nor seneschal.</p>

  <p>The inquisition then proceeded, and the jury found that the three
    forays had occurred, and the robberies, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, as stated; but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> John
    de Creppyng, who had been indicted as a captain, had not been present
    in person, but had sent his men, and shared the booty.</p>

  <p>Before the commission broke up, the charge to the earls to keep the
    peace was repeated.</p>

  <p>The next step, the commission having apparently reported, was taken
    by the king in council, who summoned the two earls to appear at
    Ambresbury, on Monday (3rd September) preceding the Nativity of the
    Virgin. Thither accordingly they came; and as it was well known that
    there had been new and repeated breaches of the peace, the matter had
    become still more serious. With a view to fresh evidence on this point,
    the king further adjourned the inquiry to Abergavenny, where he, his
    council, the jurors, and the two earls, finally met about Michaelmas.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Hereford was asked whether he had disobeyed the royal order
    either before or since the Laundon meeting; but the Earl of Gloucester,
    having absented himself, was taken as guilty of the former charge, and
    invited to meet only the latter. To this he pleaded not guilty; but
    he was permitted to take objections to the former judgment, and, by
    special favour, to hear read the previous proceedings.</p>

  <p>The points he raised were ingenious, but rather fine spun. He took
    objection to the writ of <i lang="la">scire facias</i>, under which he was
    summoned, as not having been issued through a court of law in the
    regular way. This was overruled, on the ground of the importance of
    the case, and the pressing necessity for action. Next, he objected
    to the commission itself as an <i lang="la">ex officio</i> proceeding, and not
    binding upon him. Then he advanced that his father, under the orders of
    the late and present king, had slain or done various injuries to the
    parents and kin of many of the jurors from Caermarthen and Cardigan,
    which disqualified them from sitting on the inquest. These also were
    overruled, the latter on the ground that judgment had gone by his
    non-appearance. He then said that, between the date of the original
    prohibition and the first foray (25th January to 3rd February), there
    had not been time to communicate with his distant and scattered
    retainers. This also was pronounced invalid.</p>

  <p>As to the second foray, the earl pleaded that he was not responsible
    for it, as the king had at that time seizin of his Glamorgan lands.
    This was no doubt on the occasion of his marriage, with a view to
    which event he surrendered, 18 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, his estates, and, after the
    marriage, took a regrant of them to himself and his wife, under new
    limitations. It appeared, however, from the records, that the earl had
    received seizin nine days before the second foray; so this also failed.
    As to the third foray, he pleaded the recent enfeoffment, which, being
    entirely new, removed the effect of any prohibition issued to the old
    feoffee. This, however, was met by a declaration that the prohibition
    was not territorial but personal; consequently the verdict of guilty
    was confirmed against himself and his captains.</p>

  <p>The breaches of the peace after the Laundon meeting were then inquired
    into. It was proved that, on the Thursday (29th July)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span> before <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Peter ad Vincula, the Earl of Gloucester‚Äôs people having put certain
    <i lang="la">averi√¶</i>, or ‚Äúplough bullocks,‚Äù to feed in the disputed ground,
    the Earl of Hereford‚Äôs bailiff and retainers appeared in force. Upon
    this, De Clare‚Äôs men retired with the cattle into their own lands.
    The others followed, slew some of the men, captured and drove off the
    cattle, and lodged them in Brecknock Castle. De Bohun had not known of
    this; but, on its being reported, he directed the cattle to be retained
    and ransomed. At the time of the inquiry some of them had been killed,
    and others were in custody at Brecknock.</p>

  <p>Further, on Monday (9th August) after the Assumption of the Virgin, the
    Earl of Gloucester‚Äôs men went by night, like robbers, into the Bohun
    territory. The Bohun retainers, alarmed, drove them back three leagues
    into their own lands, recovered all the cattle they had stolen, and
    took several others besides, which they brought home and still kept.
    Of these expeditions the Earl of Gloucester was entirely ignorant. The
    Bohun leaders were John Perpoynt, seneschal of Brecknock Castle, and
    the earl‚Äôs bailiff, John Deucroys, or Everoys, Philip Seys, Howell
    Vaughan, and Howell ap Trahern. Their earl, however, not only did not
    approve of this second expedition, but on hearing of it, he bound over
    his captains to bail, under which they still remained. Also, it was
    shown that, on receiving the royal order, the Earl of Hereford caused
    it to be proclaimed at church, and market, and other public places.
    Nevertheless, as he had sanctioned the retaining of the captured
    cattle, he was also found guilty.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Hereford, however, had not offended before the Laundon
    meeting, neither had the Earl of Gloucester after it.</p>

  <p>In each case the jury notice with reprehension that the earls allowed
    proceedings in the marches which elsewhere would, as they knew, have
    been punished.</p>

  <p>Both earls, with their followers, were committed to jail, and their
    Welsh franchises taken in hand by the king.</p>

  <p>Upon this Edmund, the king‚Äôs brother, William de Valence, his uncle,
    Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, and John de Hastings, gave bail for
    Gloucester; and Reginald de Grey, Robert Typetoft, Robert Fitz-Walter,
    and Walter de Beauchamp, for Hereford; and, while thus at large, they
    were permitted to hold their franchises. The earls themselves, thus
    bailed, were permitted to become bail for their followers, and thus
    passed 1291.</p>

  <p>The parties appeared again at Westminster on the morrow of Epiphany,
    1292, but sentence was not finally pronounced until Thursday (17th
    January) after the octaves of Epiphany, when the parties again appeared
    before the king at Westminster.</p>

  <p>With regard to the Earl of Gloucester, his whole franchise or royalty,
    <i lang="la">totum regale</i>, in Morganwg, was declared forfeited. But whereas
    he had married the king‚Äôs daughter, and had by her offspring; and
    whereas she had an equal share in the franchise, the earl having a life
    interest only, he could not forfeit more than his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span> own rights, neither
    was it lawful to punish the innocent for the guilty. His forfeiture
    therefore was to be for life only. He was further to be imprisoned
    during pleasure, and to pay ¬£100 damages to the Earl of Hereford.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Hereford‚Äôs Welsh franchises, being held by him without
    limitation, were forfeited altogether, and he also was remitted to
    prison. But, inasmuch as his offence <i lang="la">non est ita carcans</i>, nor
    deserving of punishment so heavy as that of his brother earl, and as
    he had married a kinswoman of the queen, who made the marriage, so
    that the earl‚Äôs children and the king‚Äôs children would be of kin, his
    forfeiture also was limited to his life.</p>

  <p>The obvious unfairness of the punishment seems to have been in some
    degree adjusted by the fines under which the earls were restored,
    Gloucester paying 10,000 marcs, and Hereford 1,000 marcs.</p>

  <p>Neither earl long survived this transaction. Gloucester died in the
    castle of Monmouth in 1295, and Hereford in 1298, but not before he
    had on more than one occasion made a bold and successful, and strictly
    legal, opposition to his sovereign.</p>

  <p>The retainers were let off lightly, on the plea that they had not been
    warned by their lords of the royal prohibition. John de Creppyng was
    fined fifty marcs; his securities being Richard de Creppyng, of co.
    York, and John Wogan, of Somerset.</p>

  <p>Richard le Flemyng was fined ¬£20; his securities were John le Waleys,
    of Somerset, and Stephen Haucumb, of Cornwall.</p>

  <p>Stephen de Cappenore was fined twenty marks; his securities being
    Robert de Typetoft, and John Lovel, of co. Northampton, at ten marcs each.</p>

  <p>William le Valers was fined ¬£10; his securities were John de Creppyng,
    of Lincoln, and Robert Fylliot, of Cumberland.</p>

  <p>Perpoynt and his fellows were left to the ordinary course of law, with
    a hint that their punishment was not likely to be very severe. And thus
    ended one of the most important transactions in the history of the
    Welsh marches; a trial evidently pressed forward by Edward with a view
    to break down the great, ill-defined, and ill-exercised power of the
    Lords Marchers, intended to be regulated by the celebrated statute of
    Rhuddlan.</p>

  <p>No apology is necessary for introducing this event at some length of
    detail into the history of a march castle; besides which, the names
    contained in it show who were at that time the great lords of the
    district. They show also, that while De Bohun‚Äôs captains were native
    Welshmen, for the Perpoynts, descendants of Giles Perpoynt, had become
    naturalised at Gileston a generation or two earlier, De Clare‚Äôs affairs
    were in the hands of strangers to the soil, men whose names, with
    the exception of Flemyng, do not appear then or since in Glamorgan
    pedigrees. (‚ÄúRolls,‚Äù i., 70; Carte, ‚ÄúHistory of England,‚Äù ii., 221;
    Dugd., ‚ÄúBar.,‚Äù i., 182; Jones, ‚ÄúBrec.,‚Äù iii., 143; ‚ÄúRot. Fin.,‚Äù 20
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>)</p>

  <p>The original cause of dispute seems to have been overlooked in the
    consequences, for nothing more is heard of the contested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span> boundary. It
    is, however, noteworthy, that very near Morlais the county boundary
    quits the well-defined Taff Vechan, and crosses the mountain in a
    direction unmarked by any natural features, so that, until an amicable
    arrangement was arrived at twenty years ago, the actual limit of each
    county continued to be subject of dispute between the manorial lords on
    either side.</p>

  <p>Morlais, though thus founded amidst contentions, seems, on the whole,
    to have enjoyed a peaceful, if not an ignoble, existence. No doubt
    the settlement of the country under the long reign of Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    destroyed its value as an outpost, and led to its neglect, or perhaps
    destruction. No mention of it has been discovered until the days of
    Leland, who says,‚Äî</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Morlays Castelle standith in a good valley for corn and grass and
      is on the ... ripe of Morlais brook. This castelle is in ruin and
      longith to the king.‚Äî(‚Äú<abbr title="Itinerary">Itin.</abbr>,‚Äù <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr>, 39.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Leland probably had not visited the spot which he thus somewhat
    incorrectly describes, but his evidence as to the proprietorship is
    likely to be correct.</p>

  <p>The circumstances that led to the construction of Morlais are
    sufficiently evident from its general position. The lower part of
    the county was protected not only by the lord‚Äôs castles of Cardiff,
    Llantrissant, and Kenfig, but by a considerable number of lesser
    castles belonging to private persons, and intended, primarily, for the
    protection of their estates. It remained to guard against the sudden
    inbreaks of the Welsh, who, descending from the north, and moving with
    great rapidity, and having, besides, the advantage of what strategists
    call ‚Äúinterior lines,‚Äù could readily select their point of attack,
    and cutting off detached parties, or sacking an occasional village
    or castle, could retreat through paths and at a rate which rendered
    useless any pursuit by the heavily armed Normans.</p>

  <p>To check such marauders, or at any rate to cut them off in their
    retreat, other castles were constructed by the marchers, such as
    Castell Coch on the Taff, the tower of Whitchurch a little below it,
    and finally, at the head of the two great valleys of the Nedd and Taff,
    and at the apex of this contained triangle of mountainous country,
    Morlais.</p>

  <p>Caerphilly belongs to the same class of defences. It was built hastily,
    and probably decided upon hastily also. It never was, and Cardiff being
    the chief seat of the lord, it may be doubted whether it ever could
    have been, of an importance at all commensurate with its extent and
    cost. Morlais, on the contrary, seems to have been solidly constructed,
    and to have been in all respects suited to the purpose it was intended
    to fulfil.</p>

  <p>Local tradition, the tendency of which is, naturally enough, to ascribe
    all considerable works to the native lords of the soil, attributes
    this to Ivor Bach, a celebrated chieftain of east Glamorgan, late in
    the twelfth century, who is reputed to have fallen in fight upon an
    adjacent spot, still called ‚ÄúPant-Coed-Ivor.‚Äù</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

  <p>That Morlais, like Caerphilly and Castell Coch, was built on the
    territory of the family of Ivor Bach is no doubt true, since he, his
    ancestors, and his descendants, as Lords of Senghenydd above and below
    the Caiach, possessed the whole tract of country between the Taff and
    the Rhymney, from Cardiff northwards to the Brecon border; but it is
    clear, from the position of the work, that it was not built by, but
    intended to curb the aggressions of, those turbulent native chieftains,
    among whom Ivor and his son Griffith, and their neighbour Llewelyn Bren
    (1315), played in their day a conspicuous part.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the residences of Ivor and his descendants, said to have
    been anciently at Castell Coch, but known to have been afterwards
    at Brithdir, at Merthyr, and finally at the Van, have never been
    recorded as at Morlais, nor is it at all probable that they would
    have constructed so expensive a dwelling upon the very verge of their
    domain, and upon a spot far too high and rocky for ordinary cultivation.</p>

  <p>It may be objected that, had Morlais been built by the Earls of
    Gloucester, it would have remained, like Caerphilly, in the hands of
    the chief lords; for the site of Caerphilly, seized upon by De Clare in
    the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, still remains an isolated part of the Cardiff
    lordship in the midst of the Van estate; but it may well be that, while
    the size and importance of Caerphilly, and its later use as a prison,
    caused the lords of Cardiff to retain it in their possession, Morlais,
    from its moderate dimensions and distant position escaping notice,
    would be dismantled, and the site allowed to revert to the descendants
    of its original owners, who still held the surrounding estate. It was
    probably soon after Leland‚Äôs time that the Crown allowed its right, as
    the then Lord of Glamorgan, to fall into disuse.</p>

  <p>The Morlais property, including the castle, passed from Ivor Bach‚Äôs
    male descendant, Thomas Lewis of the Van, by the marriage of his
    daughter with an Earl of Plymouth, to the Windsor family, in which
    family it still remains.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="NORHAM_CASTLE_DURHAM">NORHAM CASTLE, DURHAM.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE castle of Norham-upon-Tweed, ‚ÄúOld Norham,‚Äù the Queen of Border
    fortresses, and the most important stronghold between Carlisle and
    Berwick, was long the ‚ÄúCastle Dangerous‚Äù of that contested territory,
    and the strongest place on the Marches. It is a lasting monument of
    episcopal magnificence, founded, restored, and maintained by Flambard,
    Pudsey, and Beke, three of the most powerful prelates who sat in the
    chair of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert, and as an example of a great Norman keep is
    not unworthy to be named with Bamborough itself. The natural strength
    of the ground led to its early occupation for purposes of defence,
    and the traditions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> Norham are in keeping with its architectural
    grandeur. Here the Roman legions paused in their progress northwards,
    and threw up earthworks which may still be recognised, and which
    were probably abandoned when, under the military occupation of the
    country, a permanent road was laid out a few miles to the eastward,
    near to the mouth of the river. An early settlement of the Saxon kings
    of Deira seems to have been on the steep side of Yevering Bell, the
    ancient Gebrium, a spur of the Cheviot range, about twelve miles south
    of Norham, where there yet remain formidable earthworks, which Mr.
    Raine regarded as traces of the residence of the celebrated Eadwine,
    King of Deira (585‚Äì633), the disciple and friend of Paulinus, but who
    derived his knowledge of Christianity and probably his taste for a hill
    residence from Cadvan of Gwynedd, by whom he was educated. Hence, in
    later times, his successors moved their seat to Millfield, a place near
    to the Till, and scarcely nine miles from Norham. Probably it was from
    here that the Saxon kings guarded the pass of the Tweed, then called
    Ubbanford; and it may well be that their handiwork remains in the banks
    and ditches, not to be confounded with the camp of the legions, but
    incorporated with the later castle, and which much resemble in their
    figure and strength other well-known residences of the ninth century.
    Here, near this ‚ÄúNorthern home‚Äù of the successors of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert,
    Bishop Ecfrid of Lindisfarne founded the parish church dedicated to
    that saint, towards the middle of the ninth century, and placed in it
    the remains of Ceolwulph, king and saint. The two contiguous shires
    of Norham and Island, probably given by Oswald of Northumberland to
    Lindisfarne, are reputed the oldest possessions of the see of Durham,
    and detached from the body of the bishopric, presented a bold and
    strongly-fortified front of twelve miles, from Coldstream to Berwick,
    to the Scottish invaders. Early in the twelfth century arose the
    castle, of which the ruins are still so grand, and for the possession
    of which English and Scottish kings contended for centuries with
    varying success. The great Edward, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Malleus Scotorum</span>,‚Äù made much use
    of Norham in his wars, and here, both in the church and in the castle,
    were assembled before him the competitors for the Scottish throne,
    of whom he selected one rather on the score of his subserviency than
    of his worthiness. It was also from Norham that Surrey and Dacre and
    the warders of the middle march directed that formidable raid which,
    following upon Flodden, carried fire and sword almost to the gates of
    Edinburgh. But although the broad stream of Tweed still flows at the
    base of the castle rock, and the scaurs and ravines that constituted
    the strength of the position still remain unaltered upon its southern
    frontier, all else is widely changed. The lofty, though ruined,
    battlements, rising far above the tufted trees, still, indeed, remain
    the landmark of the local shire, but they no longer look out over
    wasted lands and ruined villages, harried alternately by Englishman and
    Scot, ‚Äúgalling the gleaned land with hot assays.‚Äù In no part of Britain
    are the fields more skilfully cultivated, the rickyards more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span> richly
    stored, the byres stocked with cattle of a higher breed, the farmhouses
    indicative of greater ease, or the agricultural labourer better able
    to care for his own interests. All shows plainly to the eye of the
    experienced traveller what has been achieved by the sturdy northern
    agriculturist, under the invigorating influence of an unfettered trade.</p>

  <p>Norham occupies the hollow of a grand bend of the Tweed, which here
    cuts ‚Äúa huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle,‚Äù out of the English bank
    to bestow it upon that of Scotland, in the form of a broad and fertile
    meadow. The castle stands upon a rocky platform, the south-western
    extremity of a cliff which forms the river bank for a considerable
    distance. A deep ravine cuts off the higher ground to the north-east,
    and is joined by a less marked depression, which, deepened by art,
    sweeps round and forms the southern defence until it opens upon the
    steep slope which descends to the river and forms the north and
    north-western front of the castle. Beyond this ditch, which contained
    the approach from the village of Norham, and more to the south, is a
    broad and level platform, also defended by deep ravines, upon which may
    be traced the remains of the Roman camp and the less regular banks and
    ditches of some of the besiegers of the castle. Both in its choice and
    in the manner of occupation of the position are shown much strategical
    judgment and engineering skill. It is both locally strong and well
    selected for the defence of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert‚Äôs and the Northumbrian
    frontier from Scottish inroads, as well as for the cutting off such
    invaders as, having advanced southwards, might be forced to retreat.
    The description of Simeon of Durham is both concise and accurate.
    Writing of Flambard, he says: ‚Äú<span lang="la">Condidit castellum in excelso pr√¶rupt√¶
    rupis super Tuedam flumen, ut inde latronum incursus inhiberet et

  <p>The glories of Norham, indeed, have been honourably recorded in every
    stage of its stirring existence. Its sieges, misfortunes, reparations,
    and their particulars and cost, are entered in considerable fulness in
    the sheriffs‚Äô accounts and in those of the Palatine see, and, finally,
    in its neglect and decay, it has been honoured with Scott for its poet
    and Raine for its historian.</p>

  <p>The plan of the castle is irregular, following the general outline
    of the ground. Like Barnard Castle, its form is a sort of quadrant,
    the north and east faces 143 yards and 108 yards long, being nearly
    at right angles, and more or less straight, and the border to the
    south-west a curve of 223 yards, connecting the two sides. Of the area
    thus enclosed, the north-eastern portion is occupied by the upper or
    inner ward, the plan of which is roughly square, 57 yards east and west
    by 47 yards north and south, covering, therefore, within its walls
    2,680 square yards. The north and east sides of this ward form part of
    the common curtain of the whole. In front of the other two sides is a
    broad and deep ditch, which extends <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>from the eastern ravine to the
    northern steep, and is contained wholly within the outer ward, the
    available area of which is thus considerably reduced. The whole was
    contained within a curtain wall which, where it belonged to the inner
    ward, was high and strong, but where to the outer ward was unequal,
    being high where it crossed the ends of the inner ditch and along
    a part of the north front, but elsewhere either very low or of but
    moderate thickness. Most of the care of the engineer was lavished upon
    the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The keep, the great, and, though a mere ruin, the best-preserved
    feature of the fortress, is rectangular, and measures at its base about
    64 feet north and south by 86 feet east and west, and is or has been
    about 90 feet high. The walls range from 12 feet to 15 feet thick, and
    appear to be 8 feet to 10 feet at the summit, which is inaccessible.
    The east end is a part of the exterior line of defence, and ranges with
    the curtain. The south face looks into the outer, the two other faces
    into the inner, ward. The exterior faces have certain peculiarities.
    The south-east angle is capped by two pilasters, 11 feet broad and of
    slight projection, which, like the similar pilasters at Kenilworth,
    rise from a rough, bold, sloping plinth, 12 feet high, continued all
    along the east end. These pilasters have various sets-off reducing
    them to 10 feet at the summit. They meet at and cover the angle,
    which is solid. Near the centre of the east end is another somewhat
    similar pilaster, only 10 feet broad, and beyond this the wall has been
    pulled down to the first floor. The part left, forming the north-east
    angle of the keep, had no pilaster, but is bonded into the northern
    curtain, which is of its age. The southern curtain is not in the line
    of the keep, but sprung from its south face about 25 feet west of the
    south-east angle, where it is seen to have been 7 feet thick and of
    the height of the first floor of the keep, or about 30 feet. This also
    was of the age of the keep. The southern face of the keep, so far at
    least as its outer face is concerned, is of two dates. In the centre,
    but belonging to the eastern or older part, is a pilaster, 8 feet
    broad, but without setts-off. Between this and the south-east angle,
    above the curtain, and also without sett-off, is another pilaster, only
    3 feet wide. A flat wall, without pilasters, but with two setts-off
    near the summit, occupies the next 36 feet westward. The base seems
    old, but the upper part is certainly later, into which the Decorated
    windows are probably insertions. Near the west end, about 16 feet from
    the angle, is a plain pilaster, 3 feet broad and 6 inches projection,
    which ascends to the second floor level, and stops at the cill of a
    small pointed doorway in the second floor; above this, in the two upper
    storeys, are two similar but rather smaller doors. It is probable that
    these opened from mural lobbies into garderobes of timber, projected
    from the wall: at least, it is difficult to suggest any other reason
    for doorways so placed.</p>

  <p>The west face is all of one date; the doors and windows are of the
    Decorated period, but the wall itself is Norman. The curtain of the
    inner ward abuts upon the south-west angle, and is about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span> 30 feet high
    and very thick, with a mural closet high up within it, which may be the
    garderobe, completed probably soon after 1431‚Äì2. There are two pointed
    doors, both at the ground level; one leading into the south chamber
    of the keep, the other, near the centre, into a well-stair, 10 feet
    diameter, which ascends in the wall to the summit, and terminates in a
    raised square turret, a marked feature in every view of the keep. Six
    loops, one over the other, show the line of this staircase, and a few
    feet from the top, and over the door, are four or five corbels, which
    evidently supported some kind of <i lang="fr">br√©tasche</i> of timber to protect
    the doorway below. Above are various windows, three of two lights,
    trefoiled, square-headed, but Decorated, and others of one light, with
    square labels. Towards the south end of this front, at the first-floor
    level, is a large round-headed doorway, evidently the original main
    door of the keep, the outer stair leading to which is removed. No doubt
    this stair ascended from the north end, and the chamber in the curtain,
    now inaccessible, was either an oratory or a garderobe, opening from
    the vestibule before the door. This end, like the south, is tolerably perfect.</p>

  <p>The north front is almost all removed. About 15 feet from the west end
    there remains one jamb of a door at the ground level. Beyond this,
    about 26 feet is level with the ground. The remainder, about 45 feet,
    remains to the level of the first floor, and is pierced by two loops
    from the basement.</p>

  <p>The interior of the keep shows it to have contained a basement and
    four floors, the whole divided east and west, or longitudinally, from
    bottom to top, by a party wall 5 feet thick, of which only the lower
    part remains. The basement, at the ground level, is composed of a north
    and south chamber, each 60 feet long, the northern 20 feet and the
    southern 15 feet broad. The southern was divided by a cross-wall into
    two chambers, both barrel-vaulted, the western rather the longer. The
    eastern has a loop to the east, high up, set in a splayed, round-headed
    recess; and in the north wall is a door leading into the north chamber.
    In the south wall, here 12 feet thick, is a breach 8 feet wide, at the
    ground level, which probably represents a loop. The western chamber has
    a loop in the south wall, the recess of which runs into the barrel,
    producing a groin. In the west end is a doorway and passage through the
    wall, here 15 feet thick, and by its side a loop. There must have been
    a door between these southern chambers, in the cross-wall.</p>

  <p>The northern chamber seems to have been one room only, broken into four
    compartments by groined vaulting, between each bay being a broad flat
    band. There is a loop at the east end, and two others near it, in the
    north wall. The two western bays are broken down. In the west wall is a
    loop, and near it, in the north wall, the jamb of a door of entrance,
    probably the stone doorway into the dungeon vault made in 1429‚Äì30,
    and fitted with an iron gate. This basement vaulting is about 10 feet
    high to the springing, and is original, as at Bamborough, Mitford, and
    Newcastle, and the walls <span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>and loops all round, seen from within,
    seem also original, and their interior face work is excellent open or
    jointed ashlar. The remains of the cross-wall show the first floor
    to have contained two chambers, both probably vaulted; the southern
    certainly so. Each was entered by a door from the western staircase.
    The north and much of the east wall of this north chamber is gone. In
    the west end is a Decorated window in a large round-headed recess,
    flat-sided, and near it the entrance from the staircase. In the east
    end was a loop in a splayed recess. The southern chamber was probably a
    lower and lesser hall. In its east end is a door from the well-stair,
    and another door, large and round-headed, once the main entrance.
    Against the south wall are seen the remains of the vault, of four
    compartments, groined, the bays divided by cross arches springing from
    corbels. In the most western bay was a fireplace; in each of the three
    eastern a round-headed window in a splayed recess. In the east end is
    a pointed recess and a large lancet window, the whole evidently an
    insertion. The height of this floor was about 12 feet to the spring of
    the vault.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The second was the floor of state, and, in the original keep, also the
    uppermost floor. The two rooms had low-pitched open roofs, of which the
    weather mouldings are seen, as at Porchester, in the end walls. These
    rooms were entered, each by its own door, from the well-stair, but the
    northern door has been built up and a loop placed in it. Of the north
    chamber there only remains a large window in the west wall, in a drop
    arch, a Decorated insertion. If there was any fireplace, it must have
    been in the dividing wall. The south chamber was evidently the great
    hall. In its east end is a large full-centred Norman recess, containing
    a Norman window. In the west wall, besides the staircase door, here
    pointed below a square label, is a pointed recess and window. In the
    south wall are two bold, round-headed recesses splayed to small lancet
    windows, and west of these a pointed door, probably entering a mural
    chamber, and communicating with the door already mentioned, in the
    outer face of the wall.</p>

  <p>Originally there was no third floor, and to provide this the hall roof
    was removed, and for it substituted a flat ceiling supported by nine
    joists, the holes for which remain. On these were laid the planks
    of the third floor. Of this the north chamber had in its west end a
    segmented arched window recess and the staircase door, now blocked up.
    In the north chamber, west end, was a similar staircase door and a
    pointed window recess. The east wall was not pierced, neither was the
    south wall, save by one window, and near it a small pointed door, near
    the west end. The covering of this storey was composed also of nine
    joists, which carried the planks of the fourth floor.</p>

  <p>Of this floor the remains are but slight. It also was composed of two
    chambers. Of the north the west wall remains, but it contains neither
    window nor staircase door. The south chamber has in its west end a
    window, and in its south wall a fireplace. Of this wall only about 6
    feet in height remains, so that probably about 4 feet to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> 6 feet of its
    upper part is gone. Considering the thickness of the walls, the absence
    of mural chambers and galleries in this keep is remarkable.</p>

  <p>The keep was certainly built originally by Ralf Flambard in 1121, and
    the eastern end and adjacent halves of the north and south sides were
    certainly of the same date. It is also pretty certain that Flambard‚Äôs
    keep was of the same size with the present one, and the whole basement,
    and the vaulting of the first floor, seems original. Probably there
    was but one entrance, that in the west end at the first-floor level,
    and there would be, in that case, an exterior tower or fore-building,
    covering the staircase, and of which there seem to be traces in the
    face of the curtain against which, as at Kenilworth, it must have
    abutted. The entrance is quite plain, and without a portcullis. Bishop
    Pudsey, who ruled from 1158 to 1174, is said to have rebuilt the
    western half of the ruined keep. Possibly he only restored it, for
    it is scarcely probable that half of so very substantial a building
    should have been pulled down, either with the means or in the time at
    the disposal of any band of invaders; still, it must be admitted, that
    the western half differs materially from the eastern. In the latter,
    the plinth is bold and high, and the pilasters marked features. In the
    western part are no pilasters, and no plinth of any consequence, and
    the setts-off of the wall are at a different height. If Bishop Pudsey
    rebuilt the western half, he did so in the late Norman style, so that
    the work harmonises inside with that of Flambard. Pudsey, no doubt,
    raised the walls somewhat, converted the ridge roofs of the second
    story into a flat covering, and, in the space thus gained and created,
    added two more floors, as was done to the extent of one floor, at
    Porchester, Kenilworth, and Richmond, and in many other Norman keeps.</p>

  <p>In the Decorated Period great changes were certainly made. Doors
    were opened at the ground level in the north and west walls. The
    fore-building was removed, and in its stead a well-stair inserted in
    the centre of the west wall, so as to provide a new and convenient
    approach to each floor; and this was carried up to the end in a raised
    turret, adding somewhat to the view. The entrance to this staircase
    was at the ground floor on the outside, but it did not lead into the
    basement. The whole of the west wall and the contiguous half of the
    south wall were faced with ashlar, and window-cases of the period
    inserted. All this may well have been the work of Anthony Beke, ‚ÄúPresul
    Magnanimus,‚Äù called ‚Äúthe maist prowd and masterfull Busshop in all
    England,‚Äù in that period‚Äî</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The window recesses all through the building are mostly in the Norman
    style, and therefore in almost every case much older than the windows
    which they contain.</p>

  <p>The three ends of the curtain abutting on the keep are of the same
    workmanship with, and bond into it, and are about 30 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span> high.
    That proceeding northwards is capped at the north-east angle by a
    stout bastion, with a salient angle of 110 degrees, two faces of 17
    feet, and shoulders of 4 feet. This is evidently a rebuilding after
    the introduction of artillery, and probably the work of Sir George
    Bowes. This curtain is continued 30 feet further along the river face,
    and is thence broken down. The kitchen seems to have been in the
    angle, the hall next to it, and then the chapel, all built against
    the north curtain. The curtain now standing corresponds closely to
    what the survey of 1515 calls the long high wall from the Dongeon to
    the north-west end of the kitchen (44 yards long and 30 feet high,
    contremured, so as to be 28 feet thick). We are told that in 1551 the
    chapel was 30 feet by 18 feet, with walls 8 feet thick, and with a
    crypt below capable of stabling 20 horses, and a ‚Äúcloset‚Äù above, and
    that the battlements above this closet and of the long wall were of
    the same height, and so extended from the north-east angle of the keep
    round to its south-west angle. In Sir George Bowes‚Äôs very able report
    upon the castle, he advises strengthening this wall by filling the
    hall and other buildings with earth, and forming a hall in the first
    floor of the keep, which seems then to have been much such a ruin
    as at present. Passing to the south-west angle of the keep, whence
    springs the southern curtain of this inner ward, also 30 feet high and
    very thick, this is continued 50 feet, and then broken by a nearly
    rectangular bastion tower of 40 feet projection, and 30 feet breadth,
    the ‚Äúlittle Bulwark‚Äù of 1551;‚Äîa Decorated insertion to give a flanking
    defence where it was much needed. In the rear of this tower, which
    probably was of the nature of a bastion, that is not higher than the
    curtain, are remains of buildings. Beyond it, a high bank of earth and
    rubbish marks the line, but conceals the remains of the rest of the
    curtain. In this bank, towards the west, a gap marks the position of
    the gatehouse. The well remains near the north-east corner of the ward,
    and indicates the general position of the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The <em>Outer Ward</em>, or that part of the castle outside the ditch of
    the inner ward, is of a lunated figure, 50 yards at the widest part.
    This ditch was crossed at each end by the curtain. The lower part of
    the wall at the east end still remains, and is about 8 feet thick,
    and 30 feet high, pierced by a Norman arch, probably for a postern,
    as at Carlisle. The curtain along the northern front is gone. The
    slope is there very steep, and in Sir George Bowes‚Äôs time this was
    trusted to, and the wall was a mere low breastwork. More to the west,
    as far as the lower gatehouse, the wall has been rebuilt. It is in
    parts about 15 feet thick, and 10 feet high inside, and from 15 feet
    to 20 feet outside. It probably rests in part on a Norman foundation,
    but the superstructure looks Decorated or later. It was pierced by
    deep recesses 11 feet broad under a flat arch, splayed to a loop, and
    intended to flank the approach from the town to the outer gate. Three
    of these recesses remain, and probably there were two more.</p>

  <p>The lower gatehouse is a rectangular block 40 feet long by 20 feet
    broad, and of 30 feet projection within the curtain. It is pierced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span> by
    a passage 15 feet wide, reduced at each end and in the centre by gate
    piers to 12 feet. These piers carried ribs to stiffen the barrel vault
    of the passage. The arches were round-headed. There was no portcullis.
    In front of the gate, as at Tickhill, are two projecting walls, between
    which there was probably a drawbridge. There was an upper floor. This
    gatehouse is evidently Norman, and no doubt Flambard‚Äôs work.</p>

  <p>From the gatehouse eastward for about 130 yards the curtain is
    represented by a high and steep bank of earth and rubbish, which, no
    doubt, contains its foundations. The ground rises, and the original
    bank, as well as the curtain upon it, were evidently raised to command
    the platform opposite and beyond the ditch, which seems to have been
    the favourite position for besiegers. The curtain recommences, and is
    continued for 80 yards along the high ground, forming the east end of
    the southern front. This part of the curtain is very curious, and not
    a little difficult to understand. Upon it are the remains of one, or
    perhaps two, polygonal bastions, but in the line of the wall, between
    them, are six round-headed arches of about 12 feet span, springing from
    square piers about 3 feet or 4 feet broad. Most of the masonry is so
    rough that it evidently was intended, as at Southampton Castle, to be
    covered with earth, though why, while the foundation was excellent,
    this mode of supporting the curtain should have been employed, is
    not clear; but the first, that is, the most western, of these arches
    is of ashlar, and seems to have been a gateway, and is probably the
    gateway mentioned in the history of the castle as having had its gates
    unskilfully hung upon gudgeons so placed that they could be lifted off
    from the outside. Beyond these arches and bastions the curtain makes a
    sharp turn, and proceeds northwards to 60 yards, to cross the ditch and
    join the keep.</p>

  <p>In front of the lower gate is a small platform, beyond the ditch, and
    which was, no doubt, stockaded to cover the entrance and enclose the
    barriers.</p>

  <p>The archway described as probably a gate may have been intended to
    facilitate the entrance of the villagers and their cattle, in the event
    of a raid. The outer ward was intended by Flambard, it is said, to
    afford this shelter, and the deep outer ditch was also so employed. In
    late times a complaint is made, that whereas formerly the castle ditch
    was, under all circumstances, a place of security for the villagers
    and their property, now they are attacked and captured by the Scottish
    rievers under the very walls of the fortress.</p>

  <p>The southern and outer ditch is said to have been used as a mill-pool,
    its mouth being closed by a dam. This ditch is reputed to have been
    excavated in 1495; but though it may have been then deepened and a dam
    formed, it must always have been part of the original defence.</p>

  <p>Although there is no record of any fortress or residence here before
    the time of Flambard, it is most probable, looking to the position
    and the earthworks, that it was so employed by the Saxon kings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
    Deira. These earthworks and the general treatment of the position are
    thoroughly English, just as the manner in which they are incorporated
    with the works in masonry is thoroughly Norman.</p>

  <p>The authentic history of the castle begins with 1121, when Bishop
    Flambard is recorded by Hoveden to have commenced it. Probably
    Flambard‚Äôs keep much resembled in outline and dimension, save that it
    was from 10 feet to 20 feet lower, that we now see, and his inner and
    outer ward must necessarily have been the same with the present, and in
    great part within the existing walls. Fifteen years later, in 1136, the
    castle was taken by David, King of Scotland, and held for his niece,
    the Empress Maud, for some months, until, under a treaty with Stephen,
    it was restored to the bishop. David, however, again attacked and took
    it in 1138, when it is said to have suffered much injury, and to have
    been dismantled.</p>

  <p>Bishop Hugh Pudsey, or Puis√©t, reputed to have been Stephen‚Äôs nephew,
    succeeded to the see of Durham in 1153, and probably at Stephen‚Äôs
    suggestion restored the keep. What he did it is very difficult to
    determine, since the lapse of forty years had not materially changed
    the style of architecture then in use, but whatever it was, it was
    confined to the western parts of the keep, and did not affect the
    eastern end. His funds were raised by the sending his archdeacon round
    the country provided with a fragment of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert‚Äôs winding-sheet,
    to be shown to subscribers only. Puis√©t‚Äôs labours were only too
    successful, for, being suspected of a leaning towards the party of
    Prince Henry and the Scots, he was called upon by Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> to give up
    Norham, together with Durham and Northallerton Castles, and did so in
    1174‚Äì7, when his castellan, Roger de Conyers, was superseded by William
    de Neville. Soon afterwards, upon paying a fee of 2,000 marks, the
    castles of Durham and Norham were restored to the see: Northallerton
    had been destroyed. On the bishop‚Äôs death in 1195, Norham again fell
    into the king‚Äôs hands, and ¬£29. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was paid for its maintenance.</p>

  <p>King John was here, it is supposed, four times during the vacancy of
    the see, and the consequent holding of the castle by the Crown. First,
    4th August, 1209, the only visit recorded in his itinerary, when he
    was preparing to invade Scotland. He stayed at least three days, for,
    as Mr. Raine has pointed out, an instrument given in the ‚ÄúF≈ìdera,‚Äù as
    dated 7th August, Northampton, is clearly from Norham. A little later
    he seems to have negotiated a treaty here with William the Lion, which
    was confirmed at another meeting about November, 1211, when William
    brought his son Alexander to do homage. He is also said to have paid
    another visit. All that can be shown is, that in April, 1210, he was at
    Durham, and in 1213 at Warkworth, places within easy reach of Norham.</p>

  <p>In 1215, the castle was besieged without success for forty days by
    Alexander, King of Scots, who thence advanced into England, leaving
    Norham and Bamborough unsubdued in his rear. He retired before John,
    whose followers harried the Scottish border up to Edinburgh.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

  <p>Early in the reign of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, in 1219, Norham was visited by
    Pandulf, the legate, who had recently consecrated Bishop de Marisco to
    the see. With him came Stephen de Segrave, on the part of England, and
    King Alexander, to settle disputes between the two kingdoms. On the
    bishop‚Äôs death, 1226, and even after the consecration of Bishop Poer,
    1228, Norham was held by the Crown. In 1258, Robert Nevill of Raby was
    constable for the Crown. Bishop Anthony Beke succeeded to the see in
    1283, and held it till 1310. He was rather a warrior and statesman than
    a priest, and bore a prominent part in Edward‚Äôs northern transactions.
    In May, 1291, Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> was at Norham, attended by a large muster of
    northern barons, to meet, hear, and decide between the claimants of the
    Scottish crown. Edward resided in the castle; the Scots were quartered
    at Ladykirk, then Upsetlington, beyond the Tweed. The proceedings were
    opened on the 10th of May with great state in the church of Norham,
    and in the same church, that now standing, Edward, on the 3rd June,
    received the recognition of his authority by the claimants. The court
    was then adjourned to Berwick, and Baliol, who was said to owe his
    selection to the bishop‚Äôs interest, rendered homage for Scotland at
    Newcastle. In 1296, Bishop Beke raised the banner of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert, and
    attended his sovereign into Scotland, at the head of 140 knights, 1,000
    foot, and 500 horse, he himself leading them in armour. The roll of
    Caerlaverock describes him as‚Äî</p>

  <p class="noindent">These troops formed the van of the royal army, and penetrated as
    far as Aberdeen. He was present also in later campaigns, and in
    one was wounded. His power and arrogance were, however, too great
    for a subject, and excited the ill-will of Edward, whom, however,
    he survived, dying 1310. Beke was a magnificent builder, and it is
    probably to him that must be attributed the facing of the part of the
    keep which had been restored by Pudsey; and the insertion of the great
    well-staircase and Decorated window-frames. In 1314, the castle was
    conceded by Bishop Kellow to the Crown, and Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> is said to have
    executed some repairs there. In 1316 it was restored to the see. Norham
    had its full share of the troubles of the border during the weak reign
    of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> Its captain, Thomas Gray, was twice besieged in form
    by the Scots, once by blockade for twelve months and once for seven
    months. On one occasion the outer ward was taken, but as, after three
    days‚Äô possession, the enemy could produce no impression upon the inner
    ward, they retired from so dangerous a proximity. Later in the reign,
    1322, it was taken, but recovered by Edward in person after a siege of
    ten days. In 1327, the night of the coronation of the new sovereign,
    it was near being taken by treachery, but the plot was frustrated by
    Thomas Manners, then captain. Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> is reputed to have executed
    great works at the castle.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> found Lewis Beaumont in the see of Durham. The bishop
    recovered Norham, though with some difficulty, but Barnard Castle
    remained alienated. In 1335, his successor, Bishop Bury, held an
    ordination at Norham.</p>

  <p>In 1356, ten years after the battle of Nevill‚Äôs Cross, the Scots
    burned Norham, probably the village, and surprised the town, but not
    the castle, of Berwick, which held out till the arrival of Edward
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> from Calais, when the affront was amply avenged, and Bishop
    Hatfield attested Baliol‚Äôs surrender of the crown at Roxburgh Castle
    in 1357. During the reigns of Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>, and <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, Norham was well
    maintained, and played a part in all the great transactions on the
    Border. The accounts kept by the Bishops of Durham are very copious,
    and contain many curious technical and local words. The outer bridge
    was repaired with timber in 1405, as was the roof of the Pex or Pox
    hall within the castle. A wheel was made for the well, with an axle,
    gudgeons, and a bucket. The great and other chambers and the kitchen
    were leaded. Mention is made of the chapel and of the chaplain. The
    nights being long and cold, extra wages were paid to the watchers,
    lights were allowed for the chapel, and repairs effected for the whole
    castle, excepting the great tower. In 1408, the west gate was wholly
    rebuilt in 298 days, at a cost of ¬£37. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> This can scarcely be the
    lower or outer gate at the extreme west, which is much older, and was
    probably the inner gate, which is also to the west of the keep. ‚ÄúLes
    skafald‚Äù is mentioned, and a paling of wood round the tower. In 1422
    was built the ‚Äúnew tower within the castle,‚Äù and in 1426‚Äì7 four iron
    doors were brought from the bishop‚Äôs forges at Auckland.</p>

  <p>In 1429‚Äì30, during the episcopate of Cardinal Langley, ‚Äú<span lang="la">qu√¶dam nova
    latrina</span>‚Äù was appended to the west side of the great tower, a work not
    completed in 1431‚Äì2. Also a great doorway in stone was made under the
    vault of the Dongeon of the great tower, probably the door in the
    north wall, of which one jamb remains. The doorway was fitted with an
    iron door. The draw-well had a new wheel, and a new horse-mill was
    constructed within the castle.</p>

  <p>Hitherto the bishops, when in possession of the castle, had occupied it
    by their own officers, but in 1435 the cardinal introduced the practice
    of letting it for a term to some powerful captain who was bound to
    maintain and defend it, and received a good payment for so doing.
    This practice was found convenient, and resorted to not infrequently
    afterwards. The lessee seems sometimes to have been invested by the
    bishop with the offices of constable of the castle and sheriff and
    escheator of the see. Bishop Fox began his rule in 1495 by deepening
    the outer ditch, and, indeed, the aspect of the times rendered prudent
    all possible precautions for defence.</p>

  <p>In that same year, Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>, alarmed at the reception of Warbeck
    in Scotland, prepared for war: a commission of array for the Marches
    was issued to the bishop, and Lord Surrey took the command north of
    Trent. King James crossed the Border from Scotland in two successive
    years, and in the second, 1497, appeared in person before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span> Norham. It
    was strong and well garrisoned, and by some accounts the bishop threw
    himself into the fortress, within which shelter had been afforded to
    all the country round. During sixteen days of fierce assault the outer
    defences were much injured, but the place was not entered, and Surrey
    came to its relief. The bishop then laid aside the temporal arm and
    excommunicated Redesdale and Tynedale. In September, 1498, he was
    at Norham, and lifted his censure from the borderers who submitted.
    Hamerlin and Garth, his lieutenants, during the siege, were pensioned
    for their bravery in the defence.</p>

  <p>In 1513, 22nd August, the year of Flodden, King James crossed the
    Tweed in force, and on the 29th Norham, imperfectly garrisoned, was
    surrendered to him and very roughly handled. The king then</p>

          <div class="i0">Wasted his time with Heron‚Äôs dame,</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  <p class="noindent">while his army took Etal, Wark, and Heton, and the lesser holds of
    Tilmouth, Shoreswood, Twisel, Duddoe, and Thornton. This gleam of
    success was succeeded by the defeat of Flodden, after which, in 1514,
    Lord Dacre ravaged the Scottish border to beyond Borthwick. If the
    bishop‚Äôs garrison showed want of courage during James‚Äôs attack, the
    main body of the forces of the bishopric redeemed its character at
    Flodden, where they led the van under Sir William Bulmer. It was
    the last appearance of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert‚Äôs banner in the open field, and
    often as it had been displayed, it had never been attended by defeat.
    Bishop Ruthal once more put the castle in repair; the inner ward
    and the keep were made safe, and much money expended in masons‚Äô and
    carpenters‚Äô work on walls and roofs. The castle had been ‚Äú<span lang="la">prostratum
    et disruptum ad terram</span>‚Äù by the Scots, a phrase which, however, is not
    to be taken literally. Bishops-Middleham is said to have been stripped
    for materials for Norham. By 1515 the castle was in order, victualled,
    and garrisoned. The walls were countermined as a precaution against
    ‚Äúsawting,‚Äù or blowing up. The outer walls were buttressed and provided
    with ‚ÄúMurderers,‚Äù a well-known piece of ordnance of that day. When all
    was done, the masons were despatched to pull down Home Castle.</p>

  <p>Nothing seems to have lasted very long at Norham, for William, Lord
    Greystoke, the captain, found the outer ward so ruined as to be
    defenceless. Its four towers were too low, but the inner ward was
    regarded, ‚Äúwith the help of God,‚Äù as impregnable. At this time the long
    wall between the inner gate and the nether gate next the water was
    ready to be embattled. The four towers were to be raised with ashlar,
    and quarry rubbish was ready to fill up three of them. Wolsey held the
    see from 1522 to 1528, but does not seem to have troubled himself about
    the castle.</p>

  <p>About 1530 the Scots appeared before Norham, but the castle was saved
    by the valour of Archdeacon Franklin, who had a special coat-of-arms
    assigned to him by Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> for this service. At this time there
    was regular stabling for 60 horses, a byre for cattle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span> which, if
    necessary, could hold 50 more horses, and there was room beneath the
    chapel for another 20, or 130 in all. Besides stores of salt meat,
    fish, and grain, 6 fed oxen and 400 sheep lay nightly beneath the
    castle wall. The garrison was composed of 59 men, besides children.
    This state of defence was probably stimulated by a whisper of treason,
    which caused the Privy Council to direct the Duke of Norfolk ‚Äúto look
    to it.‚Äù Bishop Tunstal seems to have maintained the defences during the
    reign of Mary.</p>

  <p>In the next few years, however, great changes took place. In 1542,
    the castle was finally put in order by Bishop Tunstal; but in 1551
    the bishop was deprived, and the castle was reported again to need
    repairs. The wall of the inner ward towards the Tweed was rotten, the
    water having got into it on the removal of the lead from the adjacent
    buildings, and in such a state that a very light battery on the Scots‚Äô
    bank would suffice to bring it down with the hall and kitchen. Half the
    keep had some time since fallen. The reporter, Sir George Bowes, points
    out the weakness of the place, and then, at great length, how an old
    castle was to made defensible in modern warfare. He especially dwells
    on the absence of flanking works. The outer ward wall, on the east,
    west, and south, is old, thin, and weak, and its small ward towers
    badly placed as flankers. The north wall was a low parapet, and the
    outer ward gates so hung that they could be lifted from the outside. He
    advises filling hall and kitchen with earth to support the river ward
    wall, and constructing a hall in the ruins of the keep. He is said to
    have lowered the keep one storey, reserving only the stair turret as a
    look-out. Probably it was at this time that the north-east bastion was
    built, and the embrasures made in the outer ward wall.</p>

  <p>In 1557 there was a fray in front of the castle, in the space between
    the bridge and the iron gate. There were but four men in the place. In
    1559, Tunstal died, and the castle was finally and by law detached from
    the see of Durham and held by the Crown, Lord Hunsdon having a lease
    of it from Elizabeth. Lord Hunsdon‚Äôs representatives, the Careys, were
    induced by James to part with their lease to Home, Earl of Dunbar, in
    whose favour the property was converted into a freehold to be held by
    socage tenure of the Crown. As late, however, as 1583 it was kept up as
    a place of defence, probably for the police of the border, and had an
    establishment of a captain of horse, an ensign bearer, a trumpeter, a
    porter and assistant porter, a master-gunner, a quartermaster gunner,
    16 gunners, a chaplain, and a surgeon, costing not less than ¬£1,703.

  <p class="drop-cap">THE annexed drawing, taken from the <cite>Illustrated London News</cite>,
    represents admirably, in Nottingham in the sixteenth century, the
    appearance of a very perfect castle of the first class. The Norman
    keep is seen on the curtain between two wards. The smaller or inner
    ward is original and Norman. It was enclosed in a lofty and strong
    curtain, following the outline of the rock on which it stood, and
    strengthened at its three most exposed angles by rectangular towers of
    no exterior projection. On two sides of the court were lodgings, and
    in the wall was a postern with exterior steps. The main gate of this
    ward was placed in the face next the tower, near the keep, and was
    covered by the middle ward. To the original castle was added, probably
    in the reign of John, or that of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, a second or middle ward,
    having an entrance through the base of a square tower, so placed as to
    cover the least protected angle of the original castle. A square tower
    serving as a gatehouse shows the arrangement was an early one, probably
    not later than the reign of John. This ward was contained within a
    strong curtain, with cylindrical mural towers of bold projection, and
    was so placed as to cover one side of the inner ward, and had its own
    ditch. Again, outside the two preceding wards, and applied so as to
    cover them on two sides, and the keep-ward on one side, was a large
    outer ward calculated to contain a small army. This ward was also
    walled with round bastion towers, that is, towers on the wall, but not
    rising above it. It also had two, or probably three, gatehouses and a
    ditch. The utter destruction of so noble a remnant of early military
    architecture is much to be regretted.</p>

  <p>The drawing shows the Trent and the castle mill, but not the two Burhs,
    mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon ‚ÄúChronicle‚Äù as guarding the river.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ABOUT a mile north-west of the town of Odiham, in the tything of North
    Warnborough, stands what remains of this ancient castle. It is placed
    on the left bank of the Whitewater, a rather copious stream, which
    rises about two miles south, and flows northwards to fall into the
    Loddon at Swallowfield. About the castle the ground is low and flat,
    and, in consequence, very wet. The Basingstoke canal has been carried
    across the marsh, and being now <span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>abandoned and choked with weeds,
    adds to the dreariness of the scene. The place, no doubt, was always
    one of strength, and the open woodland about it was favourable to the
    preservation of game, and to the wilder kind of sporting in which the
    Plantagenet monarchs took great delight.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Whatever may have been the extent of the castle in its great days,
    its remains in masonry are confined to a single tower, now in a very
    dilapidated condition. This tower is an octagon, described within a
    circle of about 29 feet radius, the faces, not quite equal, averaging
    22 feet 6 inches. The walls, casing included, were 10 feet thick; the
    interior faces, therefore, average 14 feet 9 inches, and the interior
    diameter from face to face is 38 feet. At each angle is set a buttress
    of 4 feet projection and 2 feet breadth, rising to the summit, or
    nearly so, of the building, now about 60 feet high, and which, the
    parapet and part of the wall being gone, may have been 8 feet higher.
    As the tops of some of the upper windows remain, it may be inferred
    that the height, when complete, did not exceed 68 feet.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp74" id="i_337">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_337.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">GROUND PLAN OF ODIHAM CASTLE, HANTS.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The material of the tower is a conglomerate of small flint nodules
    grouted in a large quantity of very good mortar. The whole exterior
    seems to have been faced with small ashlar blocks, possibly of Caen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
    stone. The casing is gone, but the mortar has preserved the beds of the
    stone more or less perfect. The same stone was used in the interior for
    dressings for the openings, and for a band about 4 feet high at the
    base of the wall, and for the groining of the internal angles. In these
    two latter positions, some of the ashlar has been left undisturbed.
    About one-third of the tower, including most of the two western faces,
    has fallen; but though the remainder is very rough and a mere mass of
    flint conglomerate, held together by the excellence of the mortar,
    the cores of the buttresses remain, and enough of the recesses of the
    window openings to show something of their original form and dimensions.</p>

  <p>The tower is composed of a basement and two stories. The basement floor
    is about 6 feet below the exterior ground level. It was about 12 feet
    high, and six of its eight faces appear to have been pierced. Of these
    openings, five commence within at 4 feet from the floor. They were
    round-headed and 4 feet wide. They converged upon an ordinary loop,
    and as the cill rose by six steps, the base of the loop was about a
    foot above the exterior ground level. Three of these recesses are
    tolerably perfect; another, judging from an appearance in the wall
    above, may have been the door into the base of a well-stair, ascending
    in the wall to the summit. Such a stair there was likely to have been,
    and the hollow in the wall is more like that for a staircase than for
    a chimney-shaft or a garderobe vent, and the weakening of the wall
    by such staircase would account for its having fallen on this side.
    The stair, if such it was, occupied the south end of the south-west
    face. Two of the openings in the basement have been called doorways of
    entrance from without. What remains scarcely leads to this conclusion,
    and it is exceedingly improbable that there should have been a door on
    the ground level when there certainly was one on the first floor. Sir
    E. Home‚Äôs plan, mentioned below,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> shows a sort of staircase in the
    centre of the tower, as though descending to a sub-basement floor. Of
    this not a trace is visible, and in so wet a soil a chamber much below
    the surface would be usually full of water. As regards the ground-floor
    entry, it is very possible that here, as usual, a basement window may,
    in modern times, for the convenience of entry, have been converted into
    a door, and so the present appearance produced.</p>

  <p>The first or state floor was about 30 feet high. Its south face
    was occupied by a very capacious fireplace, with a bold hood and
    mantel-piece of ashlar, now gone, and it had a round back and a large
    circular chimney-shaft carried up vertically in the thickness of the
    wall. Of the other seven faces, two are gone, and four are pierced with
    lofty, round-headed arches, about 8 feet broad, and slightly splayed.
    These, no doubt, terminated in small coupled windows. In the east face
    is an opening without splay, evidently a doorway, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>and, no doubt, the
    main entrance, with an exterior stair, as at Brunless and Coningsburgh.
    In an adjacent face is a large square locker.</p>

  <p>The upper floor also had a fireplace, a smaller one above that on the
    state floor, and in front of its chimney-shaft. This lesser shaft seems
    to have been of ashlar. The arch of the fireplace is of three rings,
    each of large, thin red tiles, having a very Roman aspect. In this
    floor the window recesses were ranged in pairs, two in each face. Of
    these, three and a half pairs, or seven window arches, remain. In the
    east face is a small locker. This story may have been 18 feet high.</p>

  <p>The floors were of timber, and composed of large beams, laid about 6
    inches apart. As the wall is the same thickness throughout there are
    no setts-off, and the walls are pierced with square recesses for the
    beams. As these recesses are not parallel but radiating, it is clear
    that the floor rested, as in the Wakefield Tower in the Tower of
    London, upon a central pier or post.</p>

  <p>There are no traces of any mural chamber of any kind.</p>

  <p>The history of this tower, the character of its casings, the thickness
    of its walls, and the round-headed figure of such arches as remain,
    point to the Norman, or commencement of the early English, period.
    Nevertheless, it is in plan very unlike the usual Norman structures,
    and the buttresses, clearly original, are characteristic of a very
    much later period. If it be Norman or transitional, it is very late
    indeed in the style; as late as the reign of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, but it must be
    confessed that the buttresses are much more in harmony with the date of
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></p>

  <p>The tower stands near the centre of a roughly-circular platform, about
    38 yards diameter, slightly raised above the marsh, and surrounded by
    a ditch. Beyond this ditch there is, on the north-east front another
    enclosure with its ditch, and the canal seems to have been carried
    through something of the same character. All this looks as though there
    had been an earlier fortification of earth and timber, possibly the
    seat of the Saxon Odo, of whom nothing is known or surmised but his
    name.</p>

  <p>There are no traces of any other masonry than the tower, and if it
    stood alone this would account for the otherwise marvellous exploit of
    the castle having been held out by thirteen men for many days against
    the Dauphin‚Äôs army. Of course, the extent of wall which so small a
    garrison could defend would be very limited; but with a tower such as
    Odiham, well-victualled, and a fireproof door, an army, especially
    unprovided with mining tools or military engines, as with an invading
    force would not be improbable, could do but little. Nevertheless, some
    of the records relative to the castle indicate other buildings besides
    the tower, though all traces of them are now gone.</p>

  <p>Odiham has no history before the time of Domesday. That it was the
    seat of a Saxon lord is to be inferred from its name, though some
    authorities repudiate ‚ÄúOdo‚Äù and his ‚ÄúHame,‚Äù and substitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span> for him
    Woodyham, Oodyham, Odiham, an etymology, no doubt, applicable enough to
    the district.</p>

  <p>In Domesday, King William is recorded as holding Odiham in demesne;
    Earl Harold had held it. It is twice mentioned in that record, and was
    in the hundreds of Edefele and Bermesplet, though a hundred of Odiham
    is also named. Nothing is said of a castle, nor does the name of the
    Bishop of Winchester, to whom it has usually been attributed, occur,
    either then or afterwards, in connexion with the lordship, borough, or
    castle. Among the royal tenants occur certain ‚Äú<span lang="la">Taini regis</span>,‚Äù who were
    represented in the reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> by the ‚Äú<span lang="la">Homines et sokemanni
    regis</span>,‚Äù who then had common of pasture in Odiham.</p>

  <p>Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> held Odiham. In the first year of his reign certain payments
    are entered upon the Pipe Rolls of the Exchequer connected with it.
    Roger Fitz-Renfrid accounted for 20<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> for a cowhouse or vaccary there;
    William de Bend for 100<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>; and the sheriff accounted for 12<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for land
    held by Richard de Rollos. The town also fined 20<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> for a murder.</p>

  <p>Odiham is frequently mentioned on the same rolls in the reign of John,
    who was there nineteen times in nine years, for at least forty days
    in all. In 3 John, William de Bend is probably represented by Adam de
    Benderges, who appears with Richard de Rollos.</p>

  <p>5 John. The men of Odiham had a charter concerning the manor, and they
    held the vill in fee farm at a fine of 100 marks or ¬£35. 4<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> rent.</p>

  <p>6 John, 1204. King John was here on the 28th July. Probably he had a
    palace here, for such there certainly was a little later at Odiham, and
    it is said to be represented by a farmhouse still known as ‚ÄúPalace‚Äù
    or ‚ÄúPlace Gate.‚Äù 11th March, Hugh Fitz-John was to have his corn at
    Odiham, then in the king‚Äôs hands, and (26th May, 8 John, 1206) John
    Fitz-Hugh was allowed in his rent the value of his chattels which the
    bailiff of Robert de Vipont had taken, saving the stock sold from the
    same manor for the king‚Äôs use by his orders.</p>

  <p>9 John, 1207. On the 23rd June the king was at Odiham; and on the 29th,
    John Fitz-Hugh was to take and hold the manor until the men there had
    paid the debt due to the king. 10th August, the same John was ordered
    to have 20 marcs from the king‚Äôs treasure for the works at Odiham;
    and 26th October, a new bed was ordered for Woodstock and another for
    Odiham, in which, no doubt, King John slept when there in December for
    three days. There also was an order for payment for making the ditches
    there at the king‚Äôs command (Close Roll, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 94 b). In 11 John, ¬£50 was
    ordered for works there. In February, May, and October, of the same
    year, 1210, John was at Odiham; in 14 John, 1212, he went from Lambeth
    to Odiham, and arriving on Sunday, 6th May, tested documents there.
    On Monday, 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> were paid for the hire of three carts, travelling two
    days and resting one, conveying the wardrobe from Lambeth; also 13<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
    to Ferling the huntsman and Thos. de Porkericiis, with the hounds, for
    their expenses and sleeping one night on the road.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span> John then left, but
    returned to Odiham on the 10th. While absent on the 8th at Freemantell,
    he paid 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> for the heads of six Welshmen,‚Äîghastly trophies sent
    to him. On the 10th, 5<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> were paid for cords bought at Winchester
    to string the cross-bows, besides expenses for hiring carts. John
    was seven days at Odiham in the May of this year, and afterwards in
    December. On 25th May, he paid 5<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> to Stephen de Guildford for a wolf
    caught by his master‚Äôs dogs at Freemantell.</p>

  <p>15 John, 1214. Money had been spent by John Fitz-Hugh on repairs of the
    king‚Äôs castles of Windsor and Odiham. The king was at the latter place
    in January.</p>

  <p>Magna Charta was tested 15th June, 1215, 17 John. In the preceding May
    the king was at Odiham, from the 21st to the 25th, and from the 28th
    to the 30th, seven days. On the 29th, he addressed the letter to Pope
    Innocent, in which he pleaded the contumacy of the barons as the reason
    why he could not go to the Holy Land. On the same day the castle of
    Devizes was ordered to be repaired, and Hugh de Beauchamp‚Äôs lands were
    to be taken possession of if he was with the rebels. From the 31st of
    May to the 3rd of June, the king was at Windsor. On 4th June, he was
    at Odiham, whence he went to Winchester and was there from the 5th to
    the 8th. He thence paid a hasty visit to Merton, but was at Odiham on
    the 9th, it is said, with seven knights only. On the 11th, he was at
    Windsor, and there remained, visiting Runnymede, from thence to grant
    the charter, and returning to Windsor till the 21st, when he was again
    at Runnymede. And so to and fro till the 26th, when he was at Odiham
    for a day. In that year there was also a charge for putting garrisons
    into Odiham and other castles.</p>

  <p>At this time John seems to have been preparing for the struggle by
    collecting what he had portable of value. The prior of Reading brought
    to him at Odiham, on the 26th June, a silver cabinet and an ivory
    cabinet with precious stones and reliques, a gold cup given him by
    the Pope, much silver and silver-gilt plate, various rolls of the
    royal chamber and of the Exchequer and his seal, all which had been
    deposited in Reading Abbey. On the following day he was at Winchester,
    and there received by Adam, the cellarer of Merton, more plate and
    jewels, sapphires, balas rubies, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, which had been in keeping of the
    convent there, and again on the same day a very much larger quantity
    also of plate and jewels, brought by Michael, a canon of Waltham, from
    the custody of the house there. The details of all these valuables are
    given at length on the Patent Rolls. From Winchester he went to various
    places in Wiltshire and the south of England.</p>

  <p>In the following year, 1216, 17 John, the king was at Odiham for the
    last time for five days in April, and on the 15th ordered twenty tuns
    (‚Äúdolia‚Äù) of his prisage wines to be sent there from Southampton. He
    issued thence an immense number of instruments, and finally left for
    Farnham on the 18th. On 21st April, the manor of Odiham was to be
    transferred by Bartholomew Peche to the seneschal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span> Engelram de Cygoyn,
    or his attorney, who seems to have been John Fitz-Hugh, to whom it was
    again transferred on the 29th. The transfer, however, was confined to
    the manor, for by a mandate of the 31st of May, directing seisin to be
    given to Fitz-Hugh, the castle was specially retained in the king‚Äôs
    hands.</p>

  <p>How strong the place was appears from the resistance it opposed in
    this year to the Dauphin Louis and the invading army. Marlborough, a
    very strong castle, had surrendered, when the French appeared before
    Odiham. The tower, says Wendover, was held by three knights and ten
    soldiers, who were besieged in form. On the third day when such engines
    as were with the army were in place, and an assault had been made and
    failed, the garrison sallied out and captured a number equal to their
    own as prisoners. After eight, or, as some accounts say, fifteen, days,
    the thirteen surrendered on terms, retaining their horses and arms
    and their liberty. Wendover says the tower belonged to the Bishop of
    Winchester, but all the evidence seems to show that neither the castle
    nor domain were ever alienated from the Crown.</p>

  <p>The first mention of Odiham in the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> is an order to
    de Cygoyn to allow Bartholomew de Peche to hold the rents of the vill
    for his sustenance in the king‚Äôs service (18th April, 1 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    1217). John Fitz-Hugh appears to have been in opposition and to have
    been dispossessed, for on 12th August he returns to his fidelity,
    and is allowed seisin of the manor and hundred of Odiham. The great
    earl marshal‚Äôs policy was to pardon and reward all who gave in their
    adhesion to the new sovereign. The castle was kept up, even to storing
    the ditches with fish, for John de Venuz was ordered (4th April, 1222,
    6 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) to allow to de Cygoyn twenty breams from the king‚Äôs
    marsh of Woolmer for stocking ‚Äúour ditches at Odiham.‚Äù On 2nd May,
    1222, 6 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, two tuns ‚Äúdolia‚Äù) of the king‚Äôs prisage wines
    were ordered from Southampton to Odiham. 16th November, 1222, 7 Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the king had let the manor of Odiham to farm for ¬£50 per annum,
    but regard was to be had to the rights of the ‚ÄúMen of Odiham.‚Äù 15th
    January, 1224, 8 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who holds
    the castle of Odiham, is directed to give up to Engelram de Cygoyn all
    his chattels and farming stock at the castle (Close Roll, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 581); and
    again, on 20th February, the constable of Odiham is directed to permit
    Engelram to remove all his chattels, stock, mares, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, from the park
    of Odiham, and what he bought with his own money. This done, the king
    seems to have taken to farming on his own account, for on 23rd February
    following, the treasurer is directed to pay to Walter de Kirkeham and
    Walter de Brackel ¬£100 to defray their expenses, and to Ralph Brito
    50 marks for the purchase of oxen for the king‚Äôs ploughs at Windsor
    and Odiham, and for seed for the lands there. Further, on the 5th of
    May, by virtue of an order directing the distribution of wine from
    Southampton to certain of the royal residences, a tun (‚Äúdolium‚Äù) of
    spiced wine was sent to Odiham. On 4th June, in the place of Henry de
    Feslegh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> deceased, Gilbert de la Dene is appointed a verderer in the
    forest of Odiham, and is to take the usual oath.</p>

  <p>In 18 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> the royal forests of Windsor and Odiham were committed
    to the care of Engelram de Cygoyn‚Äîthen a very old servant of the Crown,
    and (20 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) he had also the park of Odiham. In 21 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    Alianor, Countess of Pembroke, the king‚Äôs sister, had the castle,
    and afterwards (33 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>), as Countess of Leicester, the manor.
    Meantime, however (28 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>), her husband, Simon de Montfort, held
    the park as the king‚Äôs tenant. In the same year, de Cygoyn had a writ
    of ‚Äúallocate‚Äù for ¬£40, due to the king for two years‚Äô rent of the manor
    of Odiham; also in the same year, however, de Cygoyn was dead, and the
    sheriff was to receive from his executors all his ploughs and stock,
    and to deliver them to de Montfort.</p>

  <p>In 30 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Richard le Male held the manor. The Bishop of Bath
    and Wells had a grant of three acres of land out of Odiham to augment
    the park of Dogmersfield. In 34 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, John, the representative of
    the de Beninges family, long connected with Odiham, had been outlawed,
    and inquiry was directed as to what he held in chief there, which
    appears to have been three virgates. In 35 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, William de
    Synago had a grant of Stapelegh in the parish of Odiham, and Gilbert
    de Eversley appears among the tenants, as (38 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) does William
    Villiers for two acres.</p>

  <p>It appears from a document of this reign, printed by Rymer, that upon
    William, the son of Durandus Nanus (the dwarf), proposing to become a
    monk, the king allowed his land to pass to his cousin Margaret, wife
    of Alexander de Barentin. The land lay in Warnburn (Warnborough) and
    Odiham, and had been purchased by Durandus ‚Äú<span lang="la">de suffacio</span>‚Äù in the time
    of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> with the king‚Äôs consent. The land carried with it certain
    rights of herbage, cutting firewood, enclosing within hedges, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, and
    the whole was evidently held direct from the Crown.</p>

  <p>The chief interest of Odiham ceases with the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Edward
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> was much engaged in the north and west, and the value of fortresses
    in the interior of England was small under a prince whose sway no
    Englishman ventured to contest. His visits to Odiham were but few.
    The park or forest seems to have been kept up, but only as a place of
    diversion, and the castle probably was allowed to fall into decay.</p>

  <p>2nd September, 1274, 2 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, the king was at Odiham. In the third
    year of the reign, John de London, the king‚Äôs escheator, was to hold
    the castle during pleasure. He probably did not hold it long, for (10
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>) it was committed to Nicholas le Gras in succession to Ralph
    de Sandewych, and in 12 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> Hugh le Despenser had it. In 27
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the castle, park, town, and hundred of Odiham were included
    in the ample jointure settled on Queen Margaret, and described as
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Castrum et villa de Odeham et appruamentum [emolument] parci ibidem</span>‚Äù;
    or, in another schedule, ‚ÄúThe castle and vill, with the park and
    hundred and appurtenances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span> in the county of Hants.‚Äù In 33 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>,
    John de Beauchamp of Fyfhed held the manor.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> appears to have seen little of Odiham. In 5 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> the
    castle, which Queen Margaret had, was committed to Robert le Ewer
    during pleasure. In 9 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Robert atte Burgh had licence to
    enfeoff for Stapelegh Manor and Odiham Manor with suit of court, and a
    document of this date throws some light on the extent of the hundred
    of Odiham, which, it appears, included the vills of Odiham, Greywell
    (now Grewell), Monks Hartley, Helvethan (now Elvetham), Wynchesfelde,
    Dogmersfelde, Bynteworth (now Bentworth), Brocham (now Burkham),
    Lassham, Shaldene (now Shaldon), Weston-Patrik, Horefeld, and Lys‚Äîthe
    two last only not having been identified, unless Lys be the present
    chapelry of Lyss-Turney. Of all these, Odiham only belonged to the
    king. Next year (10 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>) Thomas de Warblyngton held the manor,
    and (12 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>) Ewer again held the castle, manor, vill, hundred,
    and park. The change was perpetual‚Äîinspired probably by perpetual
    distrust. In 13 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Hugh le Despenser, junior, held the castle
    and manor, and (15 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>) the former was again committed to Ewer.
    In this year the king‚Äôs circumstances probably led him to look to his
    strong places, for William de Kyngeston, clerk, is made receiver and
    keeper of provisions, stores, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, within the castle. In 17 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    Margery de Burgh held the castle and suit of court, as had (18 Edward
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>) John de Loxle and Constantia, his wife. In this year is an order
    to repair the king‚Äôs houses within Odiham Castle.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> seems to have turned Odiham to account as a place for
    breeding horses, and he kept up the castle. At his accession, John de
    Meriet and Maria his wife had the manor, and (4 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) John de
    Mohun had it, and it was in the hands of Joan, widow of John, 6 Henry
    <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> The custody of the castle was then in John Wodelok‚Äîhe paying for
    it ¬£60 per annum, and Nicholas de la Beche had the reversion after
    the queen‚Äôs death. In 5 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the king committed to Master
    William Mareschal the care of the great horses, and the supervision
    of the royal stud in the park at Odiham. The king himself was there
    October 25th. In 7 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Sir Bernard Brocas had a grant of
    the lordship for life. In 14 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Richard de Rokeland was
    keeper of the colts (‚Äú<span lang="la">pullanorum</span>‚Äù) in the king‚Äôs park at Odiham. In
    1346 (19‚Äì20 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) the battle of Nevill‚Äôs Cross was fought and
    King David Bruce was taken prisoner and committed to Odiham, where he
    stayed the better part of fifteen years. In 25 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, John atte
    Berwe held twelve acres in Odiham of the castle of Winchester, and
    William Talemache and others held four virgates of land there; and (33
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>) the sheriff is to provide oats, litter, and carriage for
    the support of the royal stud in the parish of Odiham, and there is a
    specified allowance for grooms, their robes, and their shoes. In 38
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the people of Odiham had been making free with the boards
    and timber purchased for the king‚Äôs work at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span> park. Five years later
    (43 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>), Walter Walsh holds the castle, vill, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, providing
    carpenter, park-keeper, and tiler for the repair of the houses outside
    and inside the castle, except the covering of the great tower and the
    working stone for the castle walls. He was also to feed the beasts in
    the park. In 46 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Elizabeth, wife of James de Wyndesor, held
    the manor.</p>

  <p>It appears from a record (2 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>) that Odiham contained places
    called Shepcote, Smethes, Romeles, and Dunton. We read also of the
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">campus de Odiham</span>‚Äù‚Äîprobably the common field. In 5 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Henry
    Esturmy held the manor‚Äîprobably the son of a man of that name who
    had it 33 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> In 15 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Alianore, wife of William
    Fremelesworth, has Le Potte and other lands in the parish.</p>

  <p>The castle does not seem to have attracted the notice of royalty during
    the reigns of Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> or <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> In the former reign Lord Beaumont had
    it for life, probably after the death of Joan de Mohun. The domain
    was still held by the Crown. In 19‚Äì23 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, a jury affirms that
    within the king‚Äôs manor of Odiham was a house called ‚Äúle Shippe,‚Äù which
    Joan, Queen of England, held in dower. Also, in 1450 (28 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>),
    the lordship, manor, and hundred of Odiham, for which ¬£21. 7<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 3<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> is
    paid by John Basket, Esq., form an item in the royal civil list; and in
    1454 (32 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>) the ‚Äú<span lang="la">Castrum, dominium, manerium, et hundredum de
    Odyham</span>,‚Äù form a part of the jointure settled on Queen Margaret, who,
    indeed, seems to have had a previous settlement (22 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>). Later
    in the reign (35 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>) William Warbleton has a grant in fee of the
    office of constable of Odiham Castle and park.</p>

  <p>In 1467‚Äì8 (7 &amp; 8 Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>), Odiham again was included in a royal
    jointure in favour of the queen of that prince.</p>

  <p>In 1 Richard <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the king took advantage of his brief power to
    appoint Richard Hansard constable and porter of the castle, parker
    and warrener of the lordship, and steward for life. Whatever might
    be the arrangements as to its mesne lords, the principal officers
    seem to have been always appointed by the Crown, and in the Act of
    Resumption of 1485 (1 Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>) is a saving clause in favour of the
    right of Nicholas and John Gaynesford to the offices of steward of the
    manor, constable and porter of the castle, and keeper of the park and
    warren‚Äîall held for their lives. The interest of the Crown was not
    finally extinguished until the reign of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, who alienated the whole.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>OSWALDESTRE.</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE hundred of Oswestry, though but of moderate extent, represents a
    tract of country which was for centuries a field of contest between the
    Britons and the men of Mercia, the Welsh and the English; for it was
    placed within the old Welsh district of Powys-Fadog, in the centre of
    the English march, and itself a marcher lordship. Its changes of name
    have been numerous, adopted as either language prevailed, or as any
    event occurred which seemed to the party in possession worthy to be
    commemorated.</p>

  <p>The earliest known name of the district is ‚ÄúMaesdir,‚Äù compounded
    of the Welsh <i lang="cy">maes</i>, a meadow, and <i lang="cy">tir</i>, land, which in
    the hands of the English, and, no doubt, upon becoming the seat of
    a <i lang="cy">burh</i>, or strong place, became Maesbury, and afterwards
    Maserfield, an unconscious but not uncommon reduplication of the same
    idea in the two languages. It was so called when here was fought the
    great battle between the Christian Oswald and the pagan Penda, about
    <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 642, in which Oswald fell; and his members are said to
    have been suspended to a cross or tree, in remembrance of which the
    place was long afterwards known as ‚ÄúCroes Oswald‚Äù and ‚ÄúOswaldestre,‚Äù‚Äîa
    not very probable etymology. No doubt the former name really indicated
    a cross erected in memory of the Christian king; and the latter,
    also part Welsh and part English, meant ‚ÄúOswald‚Äôs strong place.‚Äù The
    old Welsh <i lang="cy">maes</i> possessed much vitality, and may be recognised
    in ‚ÄúMersete,‚Äù the name of the hundred in Domesday, and probably in
    ‚ÄúMeresburie,‚Äù the name of the manor.</p>

  <p>The next change was consequent upon the erection of a handsome Norman
    church, the precursor of the present structure, when Oswaldestre became
    Blanc-Minster, or, in the language of the records, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Album Monasterium</span>.‚Äù
    Later on, however, as Oswald‚Äôs fame as a martyr gained ground, his
    name took the ascendency, and both town and hundred became known as
    Oswestry. The church was probably transferred from the Saxon foundation
    of Maesbury.</p>

  <p>The oldest work of man in the district is, no doubt, a British
    entrenchment placed on high ground a little north of Oswestry, and
    known as ‚ÄúH√™n Ddinas,‚Äù the old fortress, and which in later days has
    been called, for no sufficient reason, Old Oswestry. ‚ÄúH√™n Ddinas,‚Äù
    however, though the British, did not become the Mercian centre; this
    was probably in the first instance at Maesbury‚Äîa name found about 3
    miles south of Oswestry‚Äîbut, so far as is known, not connected with any
    earthwork, the usual mark of an early residence. This evidence is found
    on a large scale at Oswestry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span> which, therefore, there is reason to
    suppose was the English centre at least as early as the tenth century.</p>

  <p>The contention for the possession of the district does not seem to have
    commenced in the Roman times,‚Äîat least there are no Roman remains at or
    very near to H√™n Ddinas. The Welsh assert that, before the departure of
    the legions, the district was held by Cunedda Wledig, a prince of the
    Strathclyde Britons, 328‚Äì89, who gave it to his son. However this may
    have been, it would seem that in the seventh century the Cymric Britons
    had retired from H√™n Ddinas, and it had become part of the Mercian
    territory, so that Penda (635‚Äì55) held it, and fought the battle of
    Maserfield against the Northumbrian Oswald. This was a short time
    before the Mercians accepted Christianity. That the English held the
    district in the latter half of the eighth century is evident from its
    position within the Dyke of Offa (759‚Äì94); but as it is just outside
    of, or slightly intersected by, Wat‚Äôs Dyke, generally regarded as a few
    years earlier than that of Offa, it may be that the possession was at
    that time but recently settled. No doubt, after the construction of the
    greater dyke, the boundary, though often transgressed by either people,
    on the whole, in ordinary times, served its purpose, and established
    what the English at least came to regard as a right. The greatest, and
    before the arrival of the Normans the last, Welsh incursion was that of
    Griffith ap Llewelyn in the eleventh century, in alliance with Algar,
    the rebel Earl of Mercia. The result of their frequent and severe
    attacks was to lay waste the whole country, which, like Irchenfield in
    Herefordshire, so remained, and is so recorded in Domesday. The long
    period of English occupation is marked here, as all along the border,
    by frequent and strong earthworks in the fashion employed by Edward the
    Elder and √Üthelflaed in the tenth century, of which those at Oswestry
    and Whittington are among the chief; and those of West Felton, Aston,
    and Belan Banks, though smaller, are said to be of a similar pattern.
    Maesbury was, no doubt, at one time the <em>caput</em> of the English
    lordship; but it is evident, from the fashions and dimensions even of
    the poor remains of the earthwork at Oswestry, that it became the chief
    place at least as early as the commencement of the tenth century, and
    so remained, although not actually designated in Domesday.</p>

  <p>The Domesday hundred of Mersete and the later of Oswestry are very
    nearly identical, the addition being Ruyton, and the subtractions,
    Cynllaeth and Edeyrnion. Mersete extended from Weston-Rhyn, on the
    Morlais brook, in the north, to Melverley, at the junction of the
    Vyrnwy with the Severn, on the south; and from, or a little beyond, the
    Cynllaeth brook on the west, to Wykey on the Perry, to the east; about
    12 miles each way.</p>

  <p>Domesday calls Meresberie the <em>caput</em> of the lordship; but this,
    though a corruption of Maesbury, must be taken to indicate Oswestry.
    In it were five berewicks which are not specified, but which evidently
    included about twenty-four manors, of which nearly all bear English
    names. Two centuries later an inquest was taken, which gives the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
    lordship as composed of two parts, Oswestry proper and the Welshery.
    In the latter was included nearly the whole of the hundred, five
    manors, Weston and Coton (now Weston Cotton), Mesbury or Maesbury,
    Middleton, and Treveleth or Treflach. Of vills there were very many:
    Blodnorvawr, now Cefn-Blodwell, Blodowanan or Blodwell, Brongarth, Bren
    or Bryn, Clanordaffe or Glyn-yr-Afon, Crucket or Crickheath, Dudleston,
    Fenches and Juston (now lost), Kahercohon or Carrechova, Radioners
    or Rhandir, Swine or Sweeny, Tibeton (now lost), Travereleuche or
    Trefar-Clawdd, Treveltholnel or Treprenal, Trevenen or Trefonen, Weston
    or Weston-Rhyn, Wigeton or Wigginton, and Yston, now Ifton-Rhyn. The
    lord‚Äôs advowsons were the chapel of the Castle of Blanc-Minster, and
    the churches of Blodwell and Llanmenagh or Llan-y-Mynech. In this
    latter parish, though in an island of Denbighshire, was the celebrated
    Castle of Carreghova. This township, however, was a later addition to
    the hundred, and never belonged to its lords. Osbaston seems at one
    time to have been in the lordship. In it was Knockyn, the celebrated
    castle of the Lords Strange, a fief held indirectly of Oswestry. There
    was also a castle at Kinnerley, also in the lordship.</p>

  <p>Mersete, in the reign of the Confessor, and probably much earlier,
    was a royal domain, and under the names of the hundred of Mersete and
    manor of Maesbury was included in the grant by the Conqueror in 1071,
    on the forfeiture of Morcar and Edwin, to Earl Roger of Montgomery, who
    sub-granted it to Warin the Bald, his sheriff, and second in command,
    who held seventy manors in Shropshire, and by the earl‚Äôs niece Arnieria
    had a son Hugh. Warin died 1085, just before Domesday was compiled,
    and the shrievalty was given to Rainald de Bailleul, who married his
    widow, and built a castle. The entry under Meresberie is, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Ibi fecit
    Rainaldus Castellum Luure</span>,‚Äù which is explained as Luvre or ‚Äú<span lang="fr">l‚Äô≈íuvre</span>‚Äù,
    the work <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of the district. It is clear, however,
    that, as usual, Rainald‚Äôs castle was upon an earlier foundation, and
    not improbably was only an adaptation of existing works. Rainald dwelt
    at Oswestry, and either he or Warin granted its church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Oswald,
    with the tithes of the town, then for the first time mentioned, to
    Shrewsbury Abbey. It is uncertain on what tenure Rainald held his
    office, but it seems to have been held for a short time by his stepson,
    Hugh, son of Warin, till his early death; and on Hugh‚Äôs death, it was
    to Alan FitzFlaald, the ancestor of the succeeding lords, that the
    shrievalty and the fief were granted a little before the death of the
    Conqueror.</p>

  <p>The Welsh claim to have recovered and held the lordship for a space
    about this time, and state that it was given, as part of Powys-Fadog,
    by Meredith ap Bleddyn to his nephew, or son, Owen, who destroyed
    Rainald‚Äôs castle and rebuilt it in 1148; and that the tower, in memory
    of Meredith, was called Tre-Fred. However this may be, the Welsh
    occupation must have been very brief, and Alan must have recovered
    possession. At this time the house of Montgomery had, in England,
    become extinct, and Oswestry was held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span> of the Crown direct, as a
    marcher lordship, by the tenure of the defence and maintenance of the
    castle and the defence of the march.</p>

  <p>Mr. Eyton, the extent of whose information concerning the early history
    of Shropshire is only equalled by its accuracy, has thrown great
    light upon the descent of this Alan, whom he shows with more than
    probability to have been the son of Fleance, and grandson of Banquo,
    Thane of Lochaber, killed about 1048‚Äì53. Fleance, or Flaald, seems to
    have married Gwenta, daughter of Griffith ap Llewelyn, Prince of North
    Wales, by Aldith, daughter of Algar Earl of Mercia. Alan, who was dead
    in 1114, was unquestionably direct ancestor of the houses of Fitz-Alan
    of Oswaldestre, and of the royal house of Stewart.</p>

  <p>Alan FitzFlaald, lord of Oswaldestre, was father of I, William; 2,
    Walter, steward of Scotland, who died 1177, having married Eschina,
    daughter of Thomas de Londoniis, ‚Äú<span lang="la">hostiarius</span>‚Äù or ‚Äúdurward‚Äù to the King
    of Scotland. He was father of ‚ÄúAlanus Dapifer,‚Äù whose great-grandson,
    Walter, who died about 1320, married Marjory Bruce, and had Robert
    Stewart, King of Scotland.</p>

  <p>William Fitz-Alan, the head of the house, born about 1105, and who
    died 1160, acquired with Isabel de Say, his second wife, the lordship
    of Clun, which long remained united with Oswaldestre, in the person of
    their descendants, the FitzAlans, Earls of Arundel, and afterwards by
    the female line in the Howards.</p>

  <p>On the death of Thomas Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, in the reign of
    Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>, a curious question arose. He died childless, and his sisters,
    Joan, Lady Bergavenny, Elizabeth, Duchess of Norfolk, Margaret, Lady
    Lenthall, and Alice, Lady Powis, became his heirs general; but his heir
    male was John Fitz-Alan, called Arundel, Lord Maltravers. The Duke of
    Norfolk, John Mowbray, claimed the earldom in right of his mother; but
    when the earldom was adjudged to Lord Maltravers, he was allowed the
    baronies of Clun and Oswaldestre with it, nor did the duke claim them.
    So also when Earl John‚Äôs descendant, Humphrey, Earl of Arundel, Lord
    Maltravers, Clun, and Oswaldestre, died childless, 16 Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, the
    baronies were not claimed by Amicia, Lady Ormond, his sister and heir
    general, but passed to William Fitz-Alan, with the earldom, as heir male.</p>

  <p>A good deal of constitutional, or rather peerage, lore has been
    exercised upon these two baronies, which were borne among the long
    train of titles which at various times have accrued to the houses of
    Arundel and Howard, and so appear upon the garter plates of Thomas,
    Earl of Arundel, in 1611, and of Henry, Duke of Norfolk, in 1685,
    with other and Parliamentary baronies. Nevertheless, these do not
    appear to be like Fitz-Alan, Mowbray, Greystoke, and the rest, really
    Parliamentary baronies, but land baronies only, which strictly should
    only be appended to the name of the possessors of these manors.
    However, after their alienation, Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, heir
    general of the FitzAlans, was, by Act of Parliament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> 1627, created
    Baron Fitz-Alan and Lord of Clun and Oswaldestre‚Äîin right of which,
    and of that date, and under the then limitation only, these titles are
    borne by the Dukes of Norfolk, his descendants.</p>

  <h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>

  <p>The visible remains of this ancient fortress, so celebrated in border
    story, are very scanty, and are confined to the central mound, and
    to some fragments of the rude but substantial keep which was placed
    upon it. The castle stood on ground rather higher than, and on the
    north-western edge of, the town, completely commanding it; and it
    is only of late years that its site has been nearly surrounded by
    buildings. The church is about half a mile distant to the south, the
    town intervening between the two. From the mound, the view to the
    east and south is very extensive; to the west it is shut in by the
    wooded heights of the Denbighshire border, crowned by Offa‚Äôs Dyke, at
    a distance of about two miles. To the north, a mile or so distant, is
    the detached hill and camp of H√™n Dinas, or Old Oswestry, which is in
    part obscured by the still nearer but lower eminence of Llwyn. No water
    enters into the landscape, nor is there any considerable stream near at
    hand. Wat‚Äôs Dyke lies close to the east.</p>

  <p>The castle mound, though standing on high ground, is wholly artificial,
    and rather oval at its summit, which is about 60 feet by 100 feet. It
    is about 30 feet high, and perhaps 200 feet diameter at its present
    base. On its table top are some fragments of masonry, composed of large
    rolled boulders, laid in a thick bed of mortar; very rude but very
    strong work. One fragment, which in places is about 8 feet thick, is
    9 feet or 10 feet high; and near it are two other large masses, one
    of which at least is overthrown. The keep was of the shell type, and
    probably polygonal. The slopes are covered with bushes, much obscuring
    the surface, but there seems to be a further trace of masonry on the
    south-west side. The moat, out of which the mound rose, has been
    completely filled up, and all trace of the outer ward, its ditches,
    banks, or buildings, has been utterly removed. Nothing is known of a
    well. The entrance was probably on the south-west side. Gallowtree
    bank‚Äîa name preserved in the southern suburb‚Äîpreserves the memory of
    the lord‚Äôs power, as does Oswald‚Äôs well of the ecclesiastical legend.</p>

  <p>It is probable that the masonry remaining is the work of William
    Fitz-Alan, who, after 1155, confirmed a previous gift of the church of
    Oswestry to Shrewsbury Abbey. He died 1160, in which year the Pipe roll
    designates Oswestry as ‚ÄúBlanc-Minster.‚Äù On his death, Guy L‚ÄôEstrange
    became custos of the Castles of Clun, Ruthyn, and Blanc-Minster, and
    works were in progress at the latter. The livery allowed for the
    garrison was ¬£18. 5<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> per annum. In July, 1165, Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> was encamped
    near Oswestry, but his advance was checked by the Ceiriog river, on
    which he retired to Chester.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span></p>

  <p>Guy L‚ÄôEstrange continued to be custos of the Fitz-Alan estates and
    castles until 1175, during which time very large sums were expended
    by the Crown upon Oswestry, apparently about ¬£2,000. A well cost ¬£5.
    8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>, palisades 40<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> and ¬£2. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> A house was built within the walls.
    The regular garrison was a knight, two porters, two watchmen, and
    twenty men-at-arms, costing ¬£48. 13<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> per annum. In 1188, William
    Fitz-Alan received Archbishop Baldwin and Giraldus in the castle. On
    his death, in 1210, King John stepped in, and Robert de Vipont was
    in charge in 1212, and in 1213 and 1214 John Mareschal and Thomas
    de Erdington, who had purchased the wardship during the minority of
    William Fitz-Alan, who, however, died under age at Clun in 1215. In
    1216, King John was before Clun, and (August 16) burned the town of
    Oswestry, and attacked the castle, but probably without success. In
    1226, Oswestry was named for the place of conference between Llewellyn
    and the lords marchers, but the king, distrusting John Fitz-Alan,
    sent Hubert de Hoese with nine knights to attend it. In 1240, John
    Fitz-Alan‚Äôs death placed the castle again in the care of the Crown.</p>

  <p>In 1257, Oswestry was again named for the meeting of a Welsh and
    English commission, and John Fitz-Alan, the new lord, had license to
    levy customs dues for five years, to pay for a wall round the town.
    At his death, in 1267, the castle was valued at ¬£44. 12<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 5¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> per
    annum, and mention is made of the ‚Äúwalcheria‚Äù or Welshery. The wall
    probably proceeded slowly, for, in 1283, King Edward issued a patent,
    licensing the bailiffs to levy customs for twenty years, to complete
    the wall. Probably this was in consequence of an attack by the Welsh,
    who actually held the town for a short time. In 1302, on the death of
    Richard, Earl of Arundel, it was found that he held Oswestry Castle and
    its lands by the tenure of two and a half knights‚Äô fees. There were one
    hundred and forty acres of demesne land and four water-mills, but the
    castle was worth nothing; and its maintenance cost ¬£10 per annum. The
    mills were Bailey, Weston, Cotton, and Cadogan.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="PENMARK_CASTLE">PENMARK CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">PENMARK CASTLE is about a mile east of Fonmon, and two, three, and four
    miles from the castles of East Orchard, Barry, and Wenvoe.</p>

  <p>It was originally built by Sir Gilbert de Umfreville, soon after the
    conquest of Glamorgan, but the present ruins are scarcely older than
    the thirteenth century. It is probably of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, with some trifling additions of later date;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span> but it exhibits
    no traces either of a Norman keep or of any of the usual Perpendicular
    or Tudor additions. It is, and has been for some centuries, a complete ruin.</p>

  <p>The castle stands along the brow of a steep bank, about 100 feet above
    the meads of the Duffryn brook, which, with its marshy banks, formed an
    excellent defence on the north or Welsh front. It is composed of two courts.</p>

  <p>The inner court was oblong, about 70 yards by 50, of irregular figure,
    with a curtain upon the north side along the hedge of the bank, part of
    which, at each end, remains. On the south side the wall is gone, but
    its line is marked by its interior moat which, extending from the bank
    at one end to that on the other, formed the defence on the east, west,
    and southern fronts.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_352">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_352.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">PENMARK CASTLE</div>
  </div>

  <p>At the eastern end the wall remains, about 10 feet high on the outside.
    Inside is a mass of earth, no doubt covering ruins. At the north-east
    angle a circular depression resembles the foundations of a tower.</p>

  <p>The west end is most perfect. Here is a curtain about 12 feet high,
    the rampart walk of which remains, with traces of an open stair to
    the battlements. At the south end the wall returns square; and here
    was probably a plain gateway towards the church. At its north end the
    north-west angle of the court is capped by a tower semi-circular to the
    field, but angular towards the court. It has two loops and a fireplace
    on the ground floor, and appended to it on the north side is a square
    building of two floors, containing a garderobe in each floor. This is
    later than the tower. Also on the west <span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>wall, near the tower, is a
    hollow buttress containing two garderobes. The tower opens into the court.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The outer court includes the inner one on the east, south, and west
    sides, terminating at each flank on the steep bank.</p>

  <p>It contains the moat of the inner court, and was itself contained
    within a moat and wall, which probably included the church. Along the
    west face the wall may be traced to its termination in a flanking
    tower, evidently built for a pigeon-house.</p>

  <p>The position of the castle is bold and striking, and although a mere
    ruin, and without the usual accessories of ivy and trees, it has a fine
    appearance from the north.</p>

  <p>In common with most of the strongholds of the district, it is reputed
    to have been ruined by Owain Glyndwr.</p>

  <p>From the castle a road descends obliquely towards the mill, placed
    about half a mile up the stream.</p>

  <p>West of the castle is a considerable table-land, defended by two
    valleys on its north and west; an excellent place for a display of any
    cavalry that might be included in the garrison.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CASTLE_OF_PENRICE_IN_GOWER">THE CASTLE OF PENRICE, IN GOWER.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE castle of Penrice, or, as it was anciently called, Penrees, in West
    Gower, in the county of Glamorgan, is inferior only to Caerphilly,
    Cardiff, and Coyty, in the area contained within its walls, and is
    second to none in its strong, commanding, and picturesque position.
    Penrice stands at the bottom of Oxwich Bay, a mile within the shore,
    and about 150 feet above the sea. It occupies the rocky crest of a
    steep slope of greensward, at the base of which is a small lake, and
    beyond this a sort of lagoon communicates with the bay, here fringed by
    a line of sand-hills.</p>

  <p>The castle, though high, is backed on the north-east by the long and
    still higher ridge of Cefn Bryn, about half a mile distant. It stands
    upon the south-eastern end of a platform formed by the crop edges of
    the mountain limestone, which here is almost vertical, having been
    lifted up by the old red sandstone of Cefn Bryn. On the south and east
    the castle is defended naturally by a cliff ranging from 10 feet to 40
    feet in height; on the west the ground is broken and strong; on the
    north it is level, or nearly so; and this, naturally the weakest side,
    has been converted by works into the strongest and principal front of
    the place.</p>

  <p>The position and outline of the fortress have been governed by the
    disposition of the ground; the general design is simple, but is by
    no means of one date, and to the original structure there have been
    considerable additions. In plan the castle is composed of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> principal
    court, or bailey, of irregular figure, and about 60 yards north-east
    and south-west by 80 yards east and west. Three sides are curtains
    only; the fourth, or northern, is composed of the gatehouse and main
    buildings, or <i lang="fr">corps de logis</i>, and a large drum-tower with its
    appendages. The curtain skirts the edge of the precipice on the east
    and south sides. It ranges from 30 feet to 40 feet in height outside,
    and is about 25 feet within, and from 8 feet to 9 feet thick. It is
    strengthened outside by a number of half-round buttresses, of about
    12 feet diameter; these are solid, and have no projection within;
    they rise to the height of, or a little above, the walls, and form
    small flanking places of arms upon the ramparts. Of these buttresses
    there are none on the east, two on the south, and one on the west
    face; there is also one larger and loftier, but still solid, capping
    the south-western angle. There is besides a buttress tower near the
    south-east angle, of larger dimensions, and hollow; but this, in
    its present form at least, is probably a late addition built for a
    dovecote, as which it is still fitted up. The wall near this tower has
    been broken through and rebuilt, and again broken through to make space
    for a rectangular building, one angle of which is seen outside the line
    of the curtain; the rampart wall or battlement remains, and, though
    more or less ruined, is original. The merlons are about four times the
    breadth of the embrasures, and each is pierced with a loop; the rear
    wall remains.</p>

  <p>The north, or upper, side of the court is occupied by the main
    buildings and front of the castle, extending about 70 yards. At
    the east end is the gatehouse, at the west the drum-tower and its
    appendages. Between these two was a large square mural tower, placed
    in the middle of the front. Westward, between this and the drum, was
    no doubt the hall; eastward, a single curtain connected it with the
    gatehouse. The gatehouse seems to have been an addition to the curtain
    wall; it contains a central passage and two lateral chambers, which
    occupy two flanking towers of bold projection towards the north or
    exterior front; these are neither rectangular nor half-round, but more
    near to the latter figure, the angles having been rounded off. The
    floors were all of wood. There is but one groove, and that of very
    rude construction, for a portcullis, which defended the outer gate;
    and there seems to have been a drawbridge which let down between the
    flanking towers, probably over a pit, for there are no traces of a
    regular ditch.</p>

  <p>The drum-tower caps the north-west angle of the castle, and projects
    into the court. Its clear diameter is about 36 feet, the walls being
    8 feet thick, and the space within 20 feet across. It is of three
    floors; the basement is entered from the hall side; the first floor
    by two doors, one of which seems originally to have been a window. Of
    these doors, one opened from the hall, and one from an appendage on the
    south-east; there is also a loop towards the court, and a small vaulted
    chamber and garderobe on the east or outer side, perhaps an addition.
    The upper floor of the tower is remarkable; it has no entrance
    whatever, and no opening in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> walls; it must have been reached by a
    trap-door. The floors were all of timber.</p>

  <p>On the south-east side of this tower is a concentric addition, a sort
    of chemise, or rather chemisette, covering less than a quarter of its
    circumference, and projecting into the court; it is entered by a door
    from below the hall, and is lighted by two loops towards the court;
    it ends abruptly by a square wall. There was an upper floor opening
    into the hall and into the first floor of the drum, and there is a
    curious curved opening in the jamb of the lower door, evidently for a
    squint, with a rebate for a wooden shutter. On the north, or exterior
    side of the drum has been added a rectangular building of three
    stories, with fireplaces and chambers for garderobes. This building
    projects and forms the end of the north front, facing somewhat towards
    the north-west. From it a subordinate building, also rectangular,
    and containing garderobes, projects towards the west. The space
    between this group of buildings and the central square mural tower
    was contained between two walls, one still remaining, which is also
    the wall of the court, and another now destroyed, which formed the
    exterior defence on this side. As the square tower is also destroyed
    to its foundations, the manner in which the space was occupied can
    only be inferred by the openings in the remaining wall. Probably there
    was here, on the first floor, a hall and below it smaller rooms,
    perhaps cellars; there is, however, a door opening on the ground
    floor through the wall into a very small building projecting into the
    court, and which appears to have had two lateral and one end or south
    longer window. This may have been a chapel, but its axis, without any
    necessity of position, is nearly north and south. Within the court,
    attached to its east wall, remains a gable end, which, no doubt,
    belonged to a great barn, storehouse, or barrack; it was not a hall, as
    it had no large windows.</p>

  <p>The ruins of the castle, though very considerable, are so devoid of
    ashlar and ornamental work, and the masonry throughout is so uniformly
    of a rude and inferior character, that it is exceedingly difficult to
    arrive at any certain conclusions as to the extent of the original
    building, or the order of construction of the parts now remaining.
    All that can be inferred with absolute certainty is that the round
    tower and the contiguous east curtain are the oldest extant parts,
    and, though without bond, nearly of the same date; that the north-west
    lodgings are much later than either; that on the north front were
    other lodgings now destroyed, and that the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall of the
    court, including the gatehouse, are additions to the original building,
    converting what was at first an exterior curtain into an interior wall
    looking into the enclosure.</p>

  <p>The curtain next east of the tower looks older than the tower, but this
    is probably not the case. The tower was more probably the original
    building, and the whole of it. It would be a refuge in case of attack,
    either from the Welsh or from pirates, capable of holding out until
    the garrisons of Pennard, Llandremor, Webley, or Llwchwr, or those
    more distant of Swansea and Oystermouth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span> could bring up assistance.
    The tower is probably of very late Norman date, in the transition or
    pointed style. The curtain eastward was probably the first addition to
    the tower, and is the remnant of the rectangular appendage upon its
    north-eastern side. This curtain has been much cut into, and contains
    several later openings; but the door on the ground floor next to the
    tower is evidently original, and of early English date. It now leads
    into the enclosure of the chemisette, but was obviously once an outer
    door, and possibly the main entrance to the rectangular building. The
    court was probably next enclosed, and the concentric building, or
    chemisette, added to the round tower, either as a prison or a cellar,
    the door leading into it being the old main entrance above mentioned.
    The gatehouse and the north-west tower are somewhat later. Recently
    three stones, evidently parts of a window or door-jamb, have been dug
    up near the round tower; these show a simple half-round bead moulding,
    six inches diameter, and are evidently parts of a Norman jamb, perhaps
    of the lower and pointed doorway of the round tower. The north-west
    tower has a small trefoil-headed window in the third floor, which may
    be of Decorated date, though the building has rather a Perpendicular
    aspect. The masonry generally is of a very rough character; the round
    tower windows within had coigns of ashlar, but the gatehouse is of very
    inferior workmanship, even the portcullis groove being in rubble.</p>

  <p>This is a very curious ruin. A round tower of this early date is a
    very rare feature; the chemisette may be compared to the more perfect
    envelope at Tretower and Launceston, but it is evidently an addition.
    The dimensions are nearly those of Bronllys, which is, however, rather
    later, and of far superior work. It is singular that the original
    castle should have been placed so far from the edge of the cliff
    which constituted a part of its later defences. The excavations now
    in progress may yet throw a light upon the precise age of some of the
    parts. It is something to have found mouldings of the Norman period.</p>

  <p>The only parts absolutely destroyed belong to the north front, where
    the wall has certainly been blown down by gunpowder, probably during
    the occupation of Gower by Cromwell.</p>

  <p>This is not the only stronghold within the parish and manor of Penrice.
    About half a mile south-west of the castle, and west of, and very near
    to, the parish church, is a circular earthwork, composed of a single
    mound, with an exterior ditch, and an entrance on the north-west side.
    The diameter of the interior space may be 100 feet, and the mound from
    6 to 10 feet high. This is a very perfect, and evidently a very early
    work, and no doubt was stockaded with timber.</p>

  <p>The adjacent church, though much altered in recent times, has a Norman
    wall and arch, masked with plaster, between the nave and the chancel,
    and a remarkable south porch of early Decorated and a south door of
    early English date. Outside the south door of the church and in the
    porch, on the right on entering, is a water stoup, hollowed out in a
    sort of stone seat. The upper part of the tower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span> and a small north
    transept are said to have been rebuilt in the last century.</p>

  <p>The church stands upon a strong position, superior in many respects to
    that selected for the castle. The adjacent church of Nicholaston has a
    rude coupled east window of early English date.</p>

  <p>The castle, the ruins of which have been described, was for many
    generations the seat of a considerable Gower family, who no doubt
    derived their surname from their estate, therein differing from
    several of their neighbours, the owners of Nicholaston, Reynoldston,
    Leysanston, and Scurlage, whose names were bestowed upon and are
    preserved in those manors. Either custom was here common, and there are
    several examples of each in the Vale of Glamorgan.</p>

  <p>No doubt the lords of Penrice were followers of the Bellomonts and
    early Norman settlers in Gower, where they probably erected, before
    the close of the twelfth century, that part of the castle to which
    the lately-discovered Norman fragments may be assigned. The castle
    descended by a Penrice heiress to the Mansels, and is at this time the
    property of their descendant, Mr. Talbot.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="PENRITH_CASTLE_CUMBERLAND">PENRITH CASTLE, CUMBERLAND.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">PENRITH CASTLE stands upon a slight elevation of old red sandstone
    gravel, about a furlong from, and from 50 feet to 70 feet above,
    the church and the old town of Penrith, and a few yards east of the
    modern railway station. Originally and always a simple structure of no
    particular military strength or architectural merit, its remains are
    now scanty, and chiefly remarkable for the excellence of their material
    and workmanship, and well known from their position in full view of one
    of the great highways of the country.</p>

  <p>The castle is in plan rectangular, 130 feet north and south by 153 feet
    east and west. It is composed of a stout and lofty curtain-wall, within
    and against which were built the rooms occupied by the garrison, and
    outside is an artificial and dry ditch, also rectangular in outline,
    and rather peculiar in the space left between it and the castle wall.
    On the west side this ditch has been removed in the formation of a deep
    road leading from the town to the station. On the south it remains,
    and beyond it are some excavations, which appear to be old, but are
    not very intelligible. On the east side the ditch is very perfect.
    About 9 yards intervene between its scarp and the foot of the curtain
    wall; and beyond, crowning the counterscarp, is rather a high bank,
    advantageously placed for those who intended to attack the wall with
    the weapons and engines of the Middle Ages. On the north front is a
    considerable platform, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span> half the area of the castle, and on the
    same level. This is defended towards the town by a natural slope,
    made somewhat steeper by art, but the ditch is continued in the rear
    of this, round the north-east angle, just west of which is a roadway
    indicating the approach to the place. This approach was flanked by the
    north-east angle of the platform, and the ground beyond the ditch.</p>

  <p>The earthworks on this quarter are so sharp and fresh that they seem
    to have been deepened and strengthened to resist a modern attack from
    this quarter; and in that case the bank outside the east ditch may have
    been thrown up to protect the base of the curtain from being breached
    by cannon. Possibly the intention was to resist the Pretender‚Äôs army in 1745.</p>

  <p>The curtain, of which the ditch is the outwork, is about 30 feet high
    and 5 feet thick. It is built of blocks of the red sandstone of the
    district, of a deep colour and handsome appearance. These are squared,
    and laid in courses. The wall appears, wholly or in part, to have been
    crowned by a corbel-table, of moderate projection, upon which rested
    the parapets. At some special points these corbels are bolder, and form
    machicolations, but more commonly their object was to add 6 inches in
    breadth to the rampart walk.</p>

  <p>Along the east, and on the adjacent part of the north and south
    sides, the curtain is tolerably perfect. On the west side are some
    foundations, and a fragment of wall of full height. At the south-east
    angle a square buttress, original, of about 3 feet broad by 3 feet 6
    inches projection, is set diagonally, and caps the angle. In the middle
    of the east wall is a similar buttress, but set square. These have
    no bases or setts-off, and rise to the parapets. At the north-east
    angle seems to have been a bartisan, or square turret, projected upon
    corbels; the wall is quite plain below. The other two angles are gone;
    but the foundations show no trace of mural towers. Grose‚Äôs plan, though
    very incorrect, may be taken to show that late in the last century the
    walls were tolerably perfect; and that in the centre of the south wall
    and at the south-west angle were buttresses similar to those described above.</p>

  <p>All traces of the gateway are gone; but the earthwork shows it to have
    been on the north front, rather near the east end. West of this some
    traces of windows seem to indicate the site of the hall, and part of a
    large half-round barrel-vault, abutting against the remains of the west
    wall, seems to have belonged to its substructure. In the east wall,
    near its summit, are two large window openings, about 5 feet broad.
    The tracery is gone; but the arch of the recesses is flat segmental,
    strengthened by two plain bold ribs.</p>

  <p>There is no trace of any keep or detached central building. The head
    of a flat-topped window of two lights, trefoiled, has been dug up and
    preserved. It seems to be early Perpendicular. The general plan of
    the building and what remains of its vault and arches, point to the
    Decorated period, during which both the round-headed and the flat
    segmental arch were largely used in this district. What remains appears
    to be of one date. The Ordnance sheet lviii. 4. 24. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>contains a plan
    of this castle to a scale of 10¬∑56 feet to the mile, or ¬π‚ÅÑ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ.</p>

    <div class="attl">Wyman &amp; Sons, G·µó. Queen S·µó. London.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In describing the building, it has been found convenient to call the
    tower face the north, but really it fronts more to the north-east.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested, from the rectangular plan of the earthworks, and
    from the prevalence of Roman remains in the district, that the castle
    occupies the site of a Roman encampment, and that its material, said
    by some to have been taken from Mayburgh, was derived from some Roman
    building. This latter suggestion is, no doubt, perfectly possible.
    Certainly the material was not taken from Mayburgh, which never could
    have supplied ashlar in large quantities.</p>

  <p>It is certain that there was no castle here during the early Norman
    times, or while the manor was the heritage of the kings of Scotland.
    From them it came to John Baliol, and was confiscated with his other
    English possessions late in the thirteenth century. The Neviles of
    Raby then held it. Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had the castle and
    manor, and seems to have been often here. He probably made any pure
    Perpendicular additions of which evidence may remain.</p>

  <p>There are extant two licences, one to crenellate the town of Penrith,
    20 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>; and the other, 22 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, to William de
    Strickland, with permission to make a mantlet of stone and lime, and to
    crenellate it. Probably the present castle is the mantlet referred to.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="PEVENSEY_CASTLE_SUSSEX">PEVENSEY CASTLE, SUSSEX.</h2>
  </div>

  <p>PEVENSEY is, in some respects, the most interesting place in the south
    of England. Not only is it closely associated with English history
    during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but its ancient and present
    names, and a part of its material remains in masonry and earthworks,
    connect it closely with the British, Roman, and early English
    occupation of our island.</p>

  <p>It was, without doubt, the chief place in the great forest of Anderida,
    which, in remote times, extended over the south of Sussex and the
    Weald of Kent, and of which the not infrequent remains are seen in the
    very numerous and wild parks found in these districts. The British
    name, both of forest and town, is preserved in its Roman form, and the
    site of the latter is still indicated by its Roman walls and towers,
    which, like those of Porchester, have been incorporated into a later
    fortress. The Romans probably left Anderida in good repair. One of the
    chief strongholds of the ‚Äú<span lang="la">Comes littoris Saxonici</span>‚Äù was not likely to
    have been neglected, and it appears, from the Saxon Chronicle, that
    the Britons were well aware of its value, and held it against their
    piratical invaders with fierce but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span> unavailing valour. Late in the
    fifth century it was besieged and taken by √Ülle and Cissa and their
    followers, and every Briton within it was put to the sword.</p>

  <p>Andredes-ceaster, or Andreceaster, from a Roman and British, became an
    English fortress, and, by slow degrees, the Forest of Andredes-weald
    became encroached upon by cultivation. The change of masters also
    brought a change of name, and the island or ‚Äúeye‚Äù in the marsh is
    supposed to have become the property of ‚ÄúPeofn,‚Äù whence its present
    name is thought to be derived.</p>

  <p>Under the English rule, the divisions and names denoting property were
    gradually introduced, and Pevensey became the chief town of a Rape,
    an honour it shared with Chichester, Arundel, Bramber, Hastings, and
    Lewes, in each of which the town was distinguished by early earthworks,
    and at Chichester by Roman walls. Each of these Rapes had its town
    and fortress, and each town was placed upon a river. That of Pevensey
    rises in the wooded ridge about Penshurst and Dallington by a number of
    streamlets which meander athwart the marshy level of Pevensey, until a
    little above the castle they form what is still known as the old Haven,
    and which was in use in the twelfth century. As late as 1317 a grant
    by Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> mentions the marshes as overflowed by the sea, and as in
    no man‚Äôs tenure. The castle then stood on the margin of the sea, from
    which it is now more than a mile distant, and the whole area of the
    level, many square miles in extent, seems to have been an impracticable
    morass, covering the fortress towards the south and east, and in some
    degree to the north. The knoll must so have presented itself to Julius
    C√¶sar, if, as generally supposed, he here landed, and so, with the
    addition of the Roman walls, it was certainly seen by √Ülle and his
    followers, and 500 years later by Duke William when he landed between
    Eastbourne and Hastings, and selected the higher ground to the east
    of that castle for his march inland to give battle. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Mare transivit</span>,‚Äù
    says the Bayeux tapestry, ‚Äú<span lang="la">et venit ad Pevens√¶</span>,‚Äù and the chronicle
    of Battle says he landed ‚Äúprope castrum Pevensel dictum,‚Äù whence the
    soldiery went to seek victuals at Hastings. Here, then, it was, beneath
    these very walls, that the Conqueror took seisin of his yet unconquered kingdom.</p>

  <p>Pevensey, under the Normans, became once more a place of consequence,
    and one of the havens through which the sovereigns kept up their
    communications with Normandy. It was hence that the king embarked on
    his return to Normandy in 1067. William granted it to his half-brother
    of Moretaine, who is said to have built a castle there. What he
    actually built is unknown, and the only existing masonry that can
    possibly be of his date is the broken superstructure of one, or perhaps
    two, Roman towers, and some rude repairs executed on the face of one
    of them. But whatever he did he held, and continued to hold the Roman
    castle till his death, and he so held it against William Rufus, in
    1088, being supported and encouraged by Bishop Odo of Bayeux, and
    by the hope that Duke Robert would come to their relief from beyond
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span> sea. This hope was fallacious. Rufus having stormed the mound
    of Tonbridge, laid siege to Pevensey. The garrison was brave, the
    earl-bishop and his brother count were skilful generals, the walls were
    high and strong, and for six weeks the king, at the head of a numerous
    army, assailed the place in vain. A tardy force sent, not led, by Duke
    Robert, strove to land beneath the castle wall, but, though the king‚Äôs
    English soldiers were thus placed between the double attack from the
    castle and the ships, they overcame and, for the most part, slew the
    invaders. The castle was surrendered, and Odo, transmitted under a
    guard to Rochester, contrived to enter that castle, and to encourage
    its garrison to hold out.</p>

  <p>Pevensey next comes under notice in 1101 as the muster-place of the
    army led by Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> to repel the expected invasion of Duke Robert.
    He was so far successful that the invaders were driven to land at
    Porchester. Either under Earl William of Moretaine, who was taken
    at Tenchbrai and lost his lands, or under his successor, Gilbert de
    l‚ÄôAigle, the lordship or Lewy of Pevensey was erected into an Honour,
    and finally became the Honour of the Eagle, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Honor de Aquila</span>.‚Äù In
    1144, the castle was attacked by Stephen, and defended by Gilbert de
    Clare, then holding it for the Empress, to whose son, Henry, it had
    been granted by Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> It next came to King Stephen, and about 1216
    became the property, under the Crown, of William de Warren, and after
    various confiscations and restorations was finally lost to the De
    Aquila family in the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> John, Earl Warren, took refuge
    here in 1264, after the Mise of Lewes, and in the following year it was
    held by Peter of Savoy for the king against the younger De Montfort.
    Very little of the present medi√¶val masonry could have been standing
    during these various sieges. The strength of the place must have then
    mainly depended upon the Roman exterior wall, furnished, no doubt, with
    a medi√¶val parapet, and dominated by the early English mound, with
    probably a shell keep of timber or masonry upon it.</p>

  <p>About 1269 it fell into the hands of Prince Edward, and remained awhile
    in the Crown. In 1309 it was in a ruinous condition, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Confractum et
    male custoditum</span>,‚Äù Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> having declined to repair it. It must
    have been soon after this, judging from the evidence of the existing
    masonry, that the present additions were made, that is, either at the
    close of the thirteenth or very early in the fourteenth century. The
    towers are attributed to Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, in 1309.</p>

  <p>Pevensey, ‚Äú<span lang="fr">La Ville et la Lewee de Peuense</span>,‚Äù was included in the
    extensive grants made by Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> to John of Gaunt, under whom
    and the Duchy of Lancaster the Pelhams became hereditary constables.
    In 1399, Lady Pelham distinguished herself by holding the castle for
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> against the combined <em>posse</em> of the counties of
    Kent, Sussex, and Surrey. After this event it was mainly used as a
    state prison. Edmund, Duke of York, was confined here in 1405, and in
    his will bears testimony to his good treatment; and here also were
    imprisoned James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> of Scotland in 1414, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> 1419 Joan of Navarre,
    the last queen of Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> In 1650, the castle had a narrow escape
    from the claws of the Parliament, the materials having been actually
    sold for building purposes.</p>

  <p>The history of the building, though aided by passages in the public
    records, is mainly to be established by the study of the material
    remains. Those of the Roman period have fallen under the searching and
    very accurate notice of Mr. Roach Smith; the present paper deals mainly
    with the medi√¶val additions both in earthworks and masonry.</p>

  <h3>DESCRIPTION.</h3>

  <p>The Roman fortress is in plan a rounded oblong, 220 yards north-east
    and south-west by 115 yards, and contains from 8¬Ω acres to 9 acres. It
    is included within a wall strengthened by towers, and here, as at Lyme,
    the outline of the plan was evidently governed by that of the ground on
    which the castle stands, and which rises 8 feet to 10 feet above the
    sea level and that of the surrounding marsh or meadow. The wall is from
    10 feet to 11 feet thick throughout, and at this time from 20 feet to
    30 feet high. The length in circuit is about 580 yards. At the bend of
    the enclosure, towards the south-west, is the main entrance, preserving
    very nearly its original form. Two half-round towers, 28 feet apart,
    and 20 feet diameter, with produced flat sides, giving them a depth of
    30 feet, and 30 feet high, project 20 feet from the curtain, and were
    connected by a cross wall, of which only the foundation remains, and in
    which was the outer gateway. These towers are not quite parallel, but
    their longer axes radiate slightly outwards. They are solid and have
    no internal projection, but from each of them a wall ran backwards 18
    feet, terminating in a cross wall, in which was the second gateway, the
    foundations of which show that the base had an opening of 9 feet. This
    rectangular gatehouse must have resembled those of Porchester, and,
    like those, had evidently been altered to suit the Norman entrance, of
    which there remains one jamb of the outer gateway.</p>

  <p>Besides the towers flanking the entrance are eleven others upon the
    curtain wall. These also are solid, of the height and age of the
    curtain, and without internal projection. They vary from 14 feet to 20
    feet in breadth, and from 14 feet to 16 feet projection from the wall.
    They stand at irregular distances of from 14 yards to 35 yards. Besides
    the thirteen standing towers, there are two displaced and broken down,
    and the fragments of two others, making seventeen in all. They are
    closest along the north-west and north fronts, where the ground outside
    is highest. Towards the south and east there are but few, the shallow,
    muddy sea and the marsh being found a sufficient protection. Besides
    the main entrance there were three posterns, of which that to the
    north-east is still in use. That to the north is broken down, but its
    remains show it to have passed obliquely, on a slight curve, through
    the wall. The southern postern was probably a water-gate. In the south
    wall the mouth of a drain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span> about 18 inches square, and opening towards
    the sea, has been laid open. Although the wall is for the most part
    thickly covered with ivy, it is pretty evident that in parts it is
    still capped by a later battlement, and one of the northern towers,
    originally 32 feet high, bears a superstructure of 18 feet, which, from
    a window in its side, appears to be of the Norman period.</p>

  <p>The wall has been breached on the north front for 65 yards, and its
    mass, thrown forwards, still encumbers the ground outside. To the
    south is a much longer breach, at least of 200 yards. This seems to
    have been produced by a slip of the soil, by which the foundations
    have been moved forward bodily for several feet. At the east end also
    the wall has been broken down, but here its fragments, which are of
    considerable bulk, are mixed up with others of later date in wild, but
    not absolutely inextricable, confusion. Most of the north wall has
    been picked into to a considerable depth, at the ground level, but
    the foundation remains uninjured. This is said to be the work of the
    purchaser of the ruins in 1650, but may possibly be the work of some
    early assailants, though these are more likely to have worked below the
    surface of the earth, and to have inserted props of wood beneath the
    base of the masonry, which, when set on fire, would have caused the
    destruction of the whole superincumbent mass. No gunpowder has here
    been employed.</p>

  <p>It is evident that there was formerly a ditch at the foot of the wall
    on the south front, full of water, where, indeed, it may still be
    traced. Along the north, west, and east fronts, the wall is bordered
    by a road, to make which the ditch, probably never very wide or deep,
    has been filled up. There can be no question as to the authors of the
    exterior <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, both wall and towers. They are all of one, or
    very nearly one, date, and distinctly Roman, and, which is not always
    the case, the towers are bonded into the walls. The substance of the
    masonry is very rudely-coursed flint-rubble, chiefly composed of flints
    and pebbles from the adjacent sea-beach, mixed with angular fragments
    of stone, the whole held together by mortar very freely employed. This
    mortar is remarkably white in colour, and contains numerous small
    pebbles, little if any broken tile, and a preponderance of sand. On the
    whole the mortar has set firmly, and holds well together the rather
    heterogeneous mass of materials. The face of the work, both inside and
    outside, is composed mainly of squared stones from Eastbourne or Beachy
    Head. They are generally about 6 inches by 4 inches on the face, but
    sometimes as large as 12 inches by 6 inches. The lowest courses at the
    ground-level are composed of darker and far larger stones, and in the
    wall above are occasional double bands of tile, and sometimes of stone
    nearly of the colour of tile. A good deal of the facing at the lower
    part of the wall has been stripped off, but inside this stripping is
    confined to the part of the wall just above the ground-level, which is
    raised artificially higher than the level of the natural soil. In some
    places this addition is high enough to convert the lower part of the
    masonry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span> into a retaining wall. It has been thought that the earth thus
    employed was derived from the inner ditch, an early English work. It
    may be so, but more probably the contents of this ditch went to form
    the mound, and it is possible that the raised soil may be derived from
    the ditches of a British camp preceding the Roman occupation.</p>

  <p>The Romans, who constructed the outer walls, seem to have been content
    with a single line of defence; but the Northmen treated the whole area
    after a different fashion. Within the area, at its eastern end, a mound
    was thrown up, table-topped, and about 30 feet high; this, though
    within the area, was upon its margin, and rested against the eastern
    wall. The material for the mound seems to have been derived from a
    ditch which surrounded about two-thirds of its circumference, extending
    from wall to wall, and which thus isolated it from the remainder of the
    Roman area. This ditch has been filled up, probably to give space, but
    its line is still marked by a slight depression in the soil. By this
    means a strong place would be formed very nearly in accordance with the
    early English practice, having a mound or bank, with its proper ditch,
    and an appended court. The only peculiarity would be that the court
    was walled, and thus the ditch of the mound would be traversed by the
    masonry, and the outer side of the mound supported by it.</p>

  <p>The Normans, who at once saw the value and took possession of Pevensey,
    probably were for a time content with the Roman walls as they stood,
    and with the palisaded citadel of the mound. At least, there is no
    certain trace of any very early Norman masonry. Indeed, the only
    masonry of Norman date at all now to be seen is a fragment of wall with
    a window, the remains of a superstructure upon one of the northern
    towers, and some patchwork in flints, and a few courses of stone
    laid herring-bone fashion, by which the face of another of the Roman
    towers has been repaired. Had the Normans of the eleventh or twelfth
    centuries constructed any eastern walls, gatehouses, or mural towers
    within the court, some trace of them would probably remain. The chapel,
    indeed, judging from its dimensions, was Norman, and the base of the
    font decidedly so; and it is possible that the shapeless fragments of
    rubble masonry which encumber the top and slopes of the mound may be
    of the same, that is, of late Norman, date. In truth, the castle, as
    the Normans found it, was a very strong place. The walls only needed
    a battlement, and even if this were surmounted, the entrenched and
    palisaded mound would be perfectly defensible so long as provisions
    held out.</p>

  <p>At this time the Roman <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> contains the remains of a strong
    and tolerably perfect medi√¶val castle. This, as usual in such cases,
    takes the form of an addition to the defences of the mound, shutting
    it off as a citadel from the rest of the works. Advantage was taken of
    the broad and deep ditch extending from the east to the south wall,
    210 yards in length, curved westwards or outwards, and which shut off
    the mound, and a part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span> the great area, and thus formed an inner
    ward, of about an acre and a quarter, containing the mound or keep. The
    ditch, which was probably supplied with water from the sea at its south
    end, gives off a branch northwards towards the Roman tower, called the
    watch-tower, and this cuts off the north-east corner of the ground,
    which thus forms a sort of small middle ward between the forks of the
    ditch. Behind the ditch is a curtain wall, near the centre of which is
    a gatehouse of some pretensions, and three large drum-towers, of which
    two flank the gatehouse, and one is placed to the north of it.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse points to the west, opposite to that of the Roman area,
    now the outer ward, at a distance of 184 yards. In front of it are
    the two solid piers of the drawbridge, 14 feet wide, and approached
    from without between curved wing walls. The piers were faced with
    ashlar, now stripped off. The space between them is 12 feet, and may
    have been 10 feet The gatehouse is composed of two half-round towers,
    produced backwards to contain the entrance passage. Outside, these
    towers somewhat resemble those of the Roman or outer gate, which may
    have served as their pattern. Their loops are of unusual length, one
    being 15 feet long. The vents of two garderobes are seen, opening flush
    with the wall. One seems to be the lower end of a loop. They contain a
    basement, a ground, and an upper floor, looped towards the field, not
    vaulted, and duly provided with garderobes. The north tower, faced with
    sound, though rather open-jointed, ashlar, is still standing, though
    mutilated. In its ground floor is a fireplace. The south tower is
    quite broken down. The entrance passage is tolerably perfect, although
    the gateway at each end is gone, as is the upper chamber for working
    the portcullis, of which part of the grooves remain. The passage,
    12 feet broad and 35 feet long, was vaulted with a segmental vault,
    strengthened with plain broad chamfered ribs, now broken away, and in
    the vault, a little behind the portcullis, is a large square central
    hole or ‚Äú<span lang="fr">meurtri√®re</span>‚Äù for the defence of the passage. In either wall
    is an arcade of two arches, a larger and a smaller, low pointed. The
    larger are closed, the smaller pierced by doors opening into the ground
    floors of the gatehouse.</p>

  <p>Flanking the gatehouse, at a distance of 33 yards north and 54 yards
    south, are two grand round towers, each capping an angle of the
    curtain. The north curtain has a base or plinth slightly battering. The
    wall is vertical. There is no cordon between them. The north-west tower
    is 30 feet diameter, and has a basement, ground, and upper floor. The
    basement, though below the inner ward level, is on the level of the
    ground outside. It is arcaded, having six arches in its rounded sides,
    and one in its flat end or gorge. These arches have a drip of the
    double-scroll pattern, and between each pair springs a moulded rib, and
    one from each of the two right angles, eight in all. They are broken
    away, but their profile is seen, and the plan of the vault may be
    inferred. The entrance to this chamber is by a straight staircase from
    the inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span> ward, and at the foot of the stairs is a lobby on the left
    or west side leading to a postern doorway placed at the junction of the
    tower with the curtain. In the gorge wall is a fireplace, the hood of
    which seems to have been of timber. It is difficult to understand what
    this chamber can have been intended for, with its ornate details and a
    fireplace, and yet half under ground.</p>

  <p>The ground floor is entered from the inner ward by a separate entrance,
    in the right or east wall of which an opening passes into an oblong
    mural chamber, vaulted, and contained within the curtain. This chamber
    has a water drain, and above it, in the wall, three bold corbels, and
    above these a small segmental-headed doorway, now blocked up. This is
    a very peculiar arrangement, and it looks as though there had been a
    wooden structure, perhaps a garderobe, bracketed out upon the face of
    the wall, over the ditch, at about 10 feet from the ground. The upper
    floor of the tower was entered from the battlements, the tower rising
    above the wall. Only the basement floor was vaulted. Each stage is
    lighted, or rather ventilated, by loops towards the field.</p>

  <p>The southern flanking tower is nearly upon the pattern of that last
    described, save that the basement is not arcaded, and none of the
    floors vaulted.</p>

  <p>The third tower, in the north wall, 36 yards from the north-west
    flanker, is of the same pattern, with the same exceptions. The
    staircase into the basement has a side door opening upon a postern
    in the east wall, with a segmental head, and from the ground-floor
    entrance there opens, westwards, a long mural chamber, the counterpart
    of that described as attached to the north-west flanker, having
    also brackets and corbels, and a small door in the wall, 10 feet
    above the ground, as though for a timber garderobe. These are all
    the regular towers, but in the south wall, where a tower might be
    expected, is a postern, which pierces the wall at its junction with
    the Roman wall, and outside and in front of it is a fragment of a
    Roman tower, which has slipped forwards a few yards, and forms a sort
    of bulwark concealing and protecting the postern. It is evident that
    the displacement of the tower is older than the Norman period, and
    was taken advantage of by the later builder. In the north wall of
    this inner ward, beneath the north and north-west towers, is a large
    fireplace, perhaps that of a hall. The kitchen was probably in the
    north-west tower, and the large mural drain was connected with it.</p>

  <p>The mound, which occupied the east end of the castle and carried the
    keep, remains tolerably perfect, though much encumbered with ruins,
    produced evidently by gunpowder. Against its east side, and supporting
    the mound, is a Roman tower, which was worked into the keep, its solid
    top being battlemented. The mound has a spur of earth towards the
    north, probably connecting it with the north wall, but nothing definite
    can at present be ascertained, though the foundations upon it, if laid
    open, would probably disclose something.</p>

  <p>As the medi√¶val castle is placed within the eastern end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span> Roman
    area, its eastern side osculated with the Roman boundary, which is
    here common to both areas. About four-fifths of the enclosing wall of
    the castle is medi√¶val, but the remainder, that towards the east, is
    Roman, which is thus common to both fortresses. Commencing at the south
    postern, where the two walls are in contact, to the great disadvantage
    of the masonry of later date, the Roman wall extends, partially propped
    up by a later buttress, until it reaches a Roman tower that connected
    it with the keep mound. Beyond this, passing southward and eastward,
    to where the medi√¶val wall springs from the Roman <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, the
    Roman wall has been left to support the mound, but about 6 feet in
    front of it a medi√¶val wall, 9 feet thick, has been built, probably to
    afford more space above, and to assist in supporting the earthwork. The
    castle has been attacked on this side, or else those who dismantled
    it, thinking this the strongest part, have mined and blown it up, for
    the glacis for many yards is covered with enormous masses of masonry,
    which have evidently been displaced by gunpowder exploded in large
    quantities. At one part, abutting upon the Roman tower, the two walls
    are seen. About 20 feet of the medi√¶val wall, 9 feet thick and 10 feet
    high, stands undisturbed, though above this height its superstructure
    has been blown off. Behind it is the Roman wall of about the same
    height, not only reduced in height by the explosion, but tilted
    forward. This is what has happened in this quarter, and the history of
    it is clear, even in the midst of so great a confusion.</p>

  <p>Within the medi√¶val or inner ward an excavation shows the position and
    plan of the chapel, with a nave 40 feet by 16 feet 8 inches broad,
    and chancel of 12 feet 8 inches by 11 feet 6 inches. A fragment of
    the font has been preserved. The chapel is, no doubt, of Norman date,
    and older, therefore, than the castle in its present form. There is
    also a rude pillar piscina, such as is now and then found in Norman
    buildings. There are one or two in Glamorganshire. The free chapel in
    the castle is mentioned in the grant of John of Gaunt. The well also
    has been discovered at the foot of the mound. It is cylindrical, 7 feet
    diameter, and lined with ashlar to a depth of 52 feet, below which it
    is square and lined with timber.</p>

  <p>The Roman works at Pevensey have been explored and examined, as already
    stated, by Mr. Roach Smith. Unfortunately, the medi√¶val castle has been
    less fortunate, and has not been accurately described. A short but
    complete and brilliant description of Pevensey, and a notice of the
    part it played in the campaign of 1066, will be found in Mr. Freeman‚Äôs
    ‚ÄúNorman Conquest.‚Äù It also plays a conspicuous part in his recent life
    of the Red King.</p>

      <h2 class="nobreak" id="PICKERING_CASTLE_YORKSHIRE">PICKERING CASTLE, YORKSHIRE.</h2>
    </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE castle and town of Pickering stand upon the southern edge of the
    moors of north-eastern Yorkshire, where the upland subsides into a
    broad tract of meadow, which, under the names of Carr, Ing, Marisch,
    and Bottom, extends southwards nearly to Malton, and east and west from
    near Scarborough to a little short of Helmsley. This is the district
    known as the Lythe or Vale of Pickering, of which the castle was the
    chief seat.</p>

  <p>One of the principal passes into the Lythe from the north is that now
    occupied by the Malton and Whitby Railway, and down which flows the
    Pickering Beck, a tributary (through the Costa Beck) of the Rye and the
    Derwent. The pass is rather a ravine than a valley, and is deep, rocky,
    narrow, and winding. The castle occupies a rocky knoll near where the
    pass opens out into the plain, and stands a few yards east of, and 100
    feet or more above, the stream, on either bank of which is built the
    town, below and under the immediate protection of the castle.</p>

  <p>The position is upon a rocky headland, about 70 feet or 80 feet above
    the town, and jutting out sharply towards the north and west into the
    valley. Thus two sides, covering nearly half the area, are naturally
    strong. Towards the south and west the ground rises gently, attaining
    to the height of 200 feet and even 300 feet, at distances of a quarter
    of a mile to two miles. On these sides, therefore, the defence is
    artificial, and composed of a deep and broad ditch, which opens out
    upon the valley at each of its ends. It is quite dry, and from its
    position and level was probably always so: a part of it, indeed,
    carried the way up to the postern.</p>

  <p>The area thus defended falls somewhat towards the west. It is
    pear-shaped, the stalk being towards the south-west. Its cross
    dimensions are about 500 feet by 350 feet. It is contained within a
    curtain wall of considerable height and strength towards the town
    front, and having upon its southern half four towers. Upon the
    northern half were formerly two, both of which have disappeared. The
    keep and the inner gatehouse belong to both divisions, being upon the
    line common to both. Within the general area, and rather near to its
    north-eastern or larger end, is a conical flat-topped mound, wholly
    artificial, and surrounded by a circular ditch, of which a part towards
    the east is quarried out of the rock. Upon this mound stood the keep,
    and from it, on nearly opposite sides, sprung the cross curtain which
    traversed the area in almost its greatest diameter, and, with the keep,
    divided it into two nearly equal wards, to the north and the south.
    On the outer or the southern front of this wall is a deep and wide
    ditch, which extends from the ditch of the mound each way towards the
    <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, the eastern limb opening into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span> outer ditch, and
    the western upon the face of the low cliff. Each of these openings is,
    however, traversed by the main curtain. Upon the southern and longer
    limb of the cross-curtain is the inner gateway, leading from one ward
    to the other, and opposite to the outer gate, which is on the southern front.</p>

  <p>The four mural towers already mentioned are all in the southern ward.
    They are, Mill Tower, Rosamond‚Äôs, the Devil‚Äôs Tower, and the Gate
    Tower. Devil‚Äôs Tower contains a postern. Besides the keep, Leland
    mentions three towers in the north ward. Of these the inner gate was
    one, and the other two probably capped the two angles of that ward. The
    domestic buildings in Leland‚Äôs time were of timber, and are gone. There
    remains a chapel, desecrated, and of which the existing building is of
    very doubtful date.</p>

  <p>The mound is 76 feet diameter at the flat top, about 70 feet high,
    and at its base in the bottom of the surrounding ditch about 220 feet
    diameter.</p>

  <p>The keep, which is placed upon its summit, was a shell of masonry, 6
    feet to 7 feet thick; within it is circular; and outside, in part at
    least, polygonal; and was perhaps originally a nonagon, with sides of
    24 feet. Of this shell there remain two fragments, on nearly opposite
    sides of the area, one 35 feet long, and containing two loops, the
    other 24 feet, and containing a loop and a half. These are at the
    ground level. They are 6 feet high and of 3 inches opening, dove-tailed
    at the lower end, and having a short cross member. Each is placed in
    a round-headed recess of 6 feet opening, and splayed. The fragments
    are about 18 feet high, and may have been 20 feet to the rampart walk.
    Outside, the wall rises from a low plain plinth. The wall is of rude,
    roughly-coursed rubble, with ashlar dressings and quoins at the two
    angles that remain. There is a ledge or walk of about 2 feet broad
    outside the wall.</p>

  <p>From opposite sides of the mound spring the cross curtains, at a very
    obtuse angle, so that a trifle more of the base of the mound belongs
    to the south than to the north ward. These curtains are 7 feet thick,
    and are built upon the slope and across the ditch of the mound, being
    at the deepest about 70 feet high. At present they cease at the top
    edge of the mound, and do not seem to have been any higher, save by
    a parapet, or to have abutted against the keep. This is what appears
    at Tickhill and Tamworth. No doubt the parapet was continued against
    the keep wall, and there may have been a postern, as at Hawarden,
    where, however, the wall itself abuts upon the keep. The eastern limb
    is tolerably perfect as far as the counterscarp of the ditch. It is
    then broken down for some feet, but finally is seen to have abutted
    upon the outer curtain, close to the Devil‚Äôs Tower. The other, or
    western limb, extends to the inner gate tower. Towards the junction the
    curtain is somewhat thickened and very lofty. Here a straight flight of
    steps ascends from the rampart walk to a second rampart higher up, so
    that there are two rows of loops, the upper being in the battlement.
    Possibly there was a wooden gallery here to give breadth to the upper
    rampart.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

  <p>The gate tower, at which the curtain ends, was not a gatehouse, but a
    tower by the side of the gateway, but having no communication with it,
    as at Cardiff and Ogmore. This tower is 21 feet broad by 16 feet deep,
    and had a basement and two stories. The gateway, of which it formed
    the eastern side, was probably a mere opening in the curtain. The
    further side is gone, but the tower side shows no marks of vaulting or
    portcullis, and has but one rebate for the doors. Here was a drawbridge
    of 6 feet span, of which the counter-pier remains. From the gateway
    the cross curtain was continued until it abutted on the west curtain.
    All this part is gone, or nearly so. In front of the cross curtain is
    a ditch, crossed by the outer curtain at each end, and running into
    the ditch of the mound, as has already been mentioned. It is from this
    ditch that opens internally the postern of the Devil‚Äôs Tower. This
    cross curtain is of rough masonry, and at the least its lower part may
    very well be Norman work.</p>

  <p>Of the towers in the outer ward, the first to be noted is the Mill
    Tower. This caps the eastern angle of the castle. It is 31 feet 6
    inches square, with walls 10 feet thick. It has a basement and two
    upper stories, all once floored with timber. It is built of excellent
    ashlar. The basement chamber is at the ward level, but 20 feet or
    more above the ditch. It is 11 feet 6 inches square, and entered by
    an acutely-pointed doorway from the inner face. In its outer face is
    rather a singular loop. A shoulder-headed recess, 4 feet 3 inches
    broad, and 5 feet deep, converges upon a loop of 4 inches opening,
    the sides of which are parallel for 5 feet. On the splay of the loop,
    in the scanty light of it, some prisoner has carved a circle with
    figures. Outside, in the west wall, is the mouth of a small drain from
    this chamber, which was evidently a prison. The first floor is at the
    level of the rampart walk of the outer curtain, and is entered thence
    by means of an external stone stair, sheltered by a parapet, 6 feet 6
    inches high. The doorway has an equilateral head, with deep mouldings,
    beaded angles, and a passage ribbed transversely. The chamber is 15
    feet 6 inches square. In the west wall is a garderobe chamber, 2 feet
    6 inches broad by 10 feet long, looped, and with an external shoot,
    flush with the wall. In the south wall is an equilateral arched
    recess, with a ribbed barrel-vault and stone seats, and in it a
    two-light flat-topped window, trefoiled. In the east wall is a plain,
    square-headed fireplace, and a door, also square-headed, opening into a
    well-stair, which ascends hence to the battlements and the upper floor.
    This stair is contained within a triangular projection from the tower.
    It ends above under a ribbed and domed covering.</p>

  <p>Rosamond‚Äôs Tower caps the south-west angle of the curtain. It is of
    ashlar, 22 feet broad by 24 feet deep, and has no internal projection.
    The floors were of timber. It has a basement about 5 feet above the
    court level, and a first and second floor. The basement, entered from
    the ward, is 10 feet by 8 feet, and has a single loop. The gorge wall,
    at the rampart level, is pierced by a gallery to carry the rampart
    walk. The gallery descends and rises again 4 feet, the first floor,
    being so much below the rampart level. This floor seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span> also to have
    been entered by an exterior stair built over the lower doorway.</p>

  <p>The Devil‚Äôs, or Postern Tower, that north-east of the keep, is
    rectangular and of ashlar, and has exterior projection only. It is 22
    feet broad by 27 feet deep. The basement is vaulted, and pierced by a
    postern passage. The inner door, pointed, opens in the bottom of the
    ditch of the cross curtain; it is now nearly buried. The outer door
    is walled up. It is pointed, of 3 feet 6 inches opening, and placed
    in a square-headed recess, 6 inches deep, 5 feet broad by 10 feet
    high, intended to lodge the bridge when up. At the foot of this door,
    outside, in two large stones, are two holes, 6 inches diameter and 18
    inches deep, which contained the wooden axle of the drawbridge. Above
    is a central chain-hole for working the bridge. The chain must have
    carried a yoke, or sort of splinter-bar, 4 feet or 5 feet long, with
    lateral chains fastened to the sides of the platform, such as was used
    at Raglan and is still in use at the castle of Verona. This bridge must
    have had a special pit, since the way to it, inside and outside, lay
    along the bottom of the regular ditches. Above the door is a cruciform
    loop, and above that a plain one. The approach to this postern lay from
    the meadow north of the castle, up the mouth of the ditch of the place.
    The first floor of this tower is entered by a round-headed, Decorated
    door, with exterior steps, through a mural passage, 3 feet broad and
    20 feet long, at one end of which is a garderobe. The front floor is
    8 feet by 12 feet, with a cruciform loop. The second floor is entered
    from the rampart. The gorge wall coincides with the curtain, and is
    pierced to carry the rampart walk. Projecting from the curtain, close
    south of the tower, is a very handsome chamfered bracket, pierced as
    the shaft of a garderobe, and worthy of more noble service.</p>

  <p>About 12 feet north of the tower, at the junction of the cross and main
    curtain, is a rectangular turret, about 12 feet square, and pierced
    for the passage of the rampart walk. Its use seems to be to break the
    communication between the ramparts of the cross and main curtains.</p>

  <p>The outer Gateway Tower, which stands on the south or town front,
    between Rosamond‚Äôs and the Mill Tower, in general construction seems of
    the date of the inner gate. Strictly speaking, it is not a gatehouse.
    The curtain is broken and turns outwards, forming two parallel walls, 7
    feet thick and 20 feet projection. They are 12 feet apart, and between
    them lies the entrance. In the line of the curtain this passage is
    crossed by an acute arch, 2 feet thick, the springing 15 feet high,
    and above this the curtain rises to 50 feet, forming a sort of screen,
    giving the appearance of a tower over the gate. The flanking walls,
    about 20 feet high, form a sort of barbican, and no doubt protected
    the drawbridge. A door above opened upon these battlements. The work
    is poor; there is no portcullis or portal vault. The entrance is quite
    unworthy of the castle.</p>

  <p>Returning to the inner ward, no doubt the three towers mentioned by
    Leland were the inner gate tower, and two upon the two angles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span> of the
    ward; but these are gone; though probably, if the turf and brambles
    were removed, the foundations would be seen.</p>

  <p>The Norman doorway may have opened into one of these towers. At present
    it fronts a recess in the curtain 6 feet broad, barrel vaulted; and 6
    feet high to the <em>abacus</em> or string which marks the springing.
    The doorway was flanked by two nook shafts, now gone, standing upon
    square plinths, and with fluted capitals. The architrave is highly
    ornate, having a beaded angle with a moulding of pointed arches
    repeated. This looks like rather late Norman, and is the only bit of
    work in the castle distinctly referable to that period. The drip, if
    ever there was one, is gone. There is no rebate or trace of a door.
    The adjacent curtain is low and ruinous. Here are several corbels, as
    though to support a lean-to range of buildings. Near this door is a
    small building, which looks modern, with four old lancets inserted,
    and a door which seems copied from an older one. This is said to be
    the chapel of the castle which Leland saw, and which was served by one
    chantry priest. Grose calls it a small, mean building, with some old
    pews in it. It is now a potato store.</p>

  <p>Pickering Castle represents one great type of Anglo-Norman
    fortress‚Äîthat is, a castle of Norman masonry upon an English earthwork,
    for the present walls, if not Norman, are unquestionably laid upon
    Norman lines. Here the mound does not, as is more usual, form a part of
    the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, but is concentric, though placed out of centre,
    like the earthwork at Barwick in Elmete.</p>

  <p>No doubt the earthworks were taken possession of and walled, either
    late in the eleventh or early in the twelfth century, in the Norman
    period, and the mass of the curtains, with the keep and the Norman
    door, are probably remains of this work. But the whole fortress was
    rebuilt in the Decorated period, the mural towers added, the curtains
    raised, and the place rendered stronger. It is difficult to decide on
    the age of the gateways. They may be Norman or they may be of the time
    of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, probably the former.</p>

  <p>The domestic buildings are said to have been of timber. They are gone.
    There is no known well. The castle mill was upon the river a little
    below the castle. The ditch along the south and west has been nearly
    filled up; beyond it is a hollow way leading down to the river, which
    may be old, and intended as a second line of defence.</p>

  <p>It is stated in Domesday that, in the time of King Edward, Pickering
    (Pickeringa) belonged to Earl Morcar. It was then held by the king,
    with four <em>berewicks</em>, or appended manors, and some chapelries
    or spiritual dependencies of the parish church. The castle and its
    territory seem never to have been alienated from the Norman crown. The
    Pipe Roll of 31 Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> mentions that Robert de Widville rendered
    account for the ‚Äúcensus rents of the forest of Pickering.‚Äù In 31
    Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> pannage was accounted for from the forest; and in 1 Richard
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, rents were accounted for by William Boie and Alan Fitz-Geoffrey,
    probably the same who occurs in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>same year as Alan de Pikering.
    In 33 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> the men of Pickering were assessed in a <em>donum</em>
    towards a royal expedition, a tax which was from time to time repeated.
    In 9 Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> mention is made of the wapentake and town of Pickering;
    and in 11 John, a settlement was ordered of the boundaries between the
    king‚Äôs forest of Pickering and N. de Stuteville‚Äôs forest.</p>

    <div class="caption">PICKERING CASTLE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>King John was here in February, 1201; August, 1208; and March, 1210;
    each time for a day.</p>

  <p>In 45 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> the castle was held by Hugh le Bigod against the
    king, with Scarborough, which castle he was monished under the Bull of
    Alexander <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> to surrender.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> granted Pickering to his son, Edmund Earl of Lancaster,
    about which time mention is made of the manor, fee, and forestry of
    Pickering. In 13 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> the earl had confirmation of the manor,
    castle, and forest. On the execution and attainder of Earl Thomas,
    Henry Earl of Northumberland had charge of the castle, but on the fall
    of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, Earl Henry recovered it. When Henry of Lancaster landed
    at Ravensburn in 1399, he marched on and retook Pickering, then held
    for the king.</p>

  <p>King Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> was prisoner here before his removal to Pontefract.</p>

  <p>Peck enumerates Pickering among the royal castles, and says there was
    a steward of the lordship, a constable of the castle, a master of the
    game, and a rider of the forest.</p>

  <p>Pickering was held for the king in the parliamentary struggles, and
    breached on the west point, and dismantled. It seems never to have
    been permanently alienated from the royal demesnes. The Crown held it
    from the Conquest until it was granted by Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> to the Earl of
    Lancaster, since which its history is that of the estates of the Duchy
    of Lancaster, of which it still forms a part.</p>

  <p>With Pickering Castle should be mentioned a very curious, though
    nameless and but little known earthwork in its immediate neighbourhood.
    This is not even laid down as an earthwork in the Ordnance Map, usually
    so accurate, though marked as the site of a station. It is placed upon
    the highest part of a round, grassy hill, with easy slopes, which rises
    upon the western or right bank of the Beck or river of Pickering,
    about 200 feet above the water, and opposite to, and a little lower
    down than, the castle. The position is good, it is clear of the ravine
    which opens out just above the town and castle, and from it is a rich
    and extensive view, especially to the south and west, over Rysdale and
    towards Helmsley. The labour bestowed upon the work is light compared
    with that expended upon the earthworks of the castle, though the mound
    is the leading feature of both, and attests their common Saxon or early
    English origin.</p>

  <p>A central mound, 90 feet in diameter at the top and 20 feet high,
    is girt by a ditch, out of which it rises, and upon the outer edge
    of which is a low bank. The summit of the mound is level, but is
    surrounded by a light, circular bank, which probably was heaped up
    to cover the lower edge of the timber defence or residence, which
    no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span> doubt was here placed. The entrance seems to have been on the
    south-east side, where are marks of a way across the outer bank, and
    perhaps of a causeway over the ditch. The hill is enclosed, and part
    of it under the plough, so that no traces of any exterior or appended
    enclosures are visible. The work, though its general outline is to be
    traced with certainty, is much lowered, and its details weakened and
    rendered obscure by time and weather. It is, however, an earthwork of
    the same general class with Laughton, Barwick, Castleton, and others
    similar to them in Yorkshire and elsewhere, and, with them, it deserves
    attention. Possibly it is earlier than the castle mound of Pickering,
    and probably was abandoned when that was thrown up; perhaps when
    the wealth and power of the owner enabled him to found the lythe or
    lordship of Pickering.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CASTLE_OF_PONTEFRACT_YORKSHIRE">THE CASTLE OF PONTEFRACT, YORKSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">‚ÄúOUR HISTORIES,‚Äù says Swift, ‚Äúare full of Pomfret Castle;‚Äù and although
    this has long ceased to be the case, and Pomfret be now famous but
    for cakes and the cultivation of the root employed in the soothing of
    catarrh and the adulteration of railway coffee, it was once a very
    famous, and is still a very interesting, place.</p>

  <p>Whence came the name of Pontefract, and when and where its bridge was
    broken down, are questions over which antiquaries have long stumbled,
    seeing that the Aire, the only stream of the district needing to be
    traversed by a bridge, is two miles from the town and quite out of its girth.</p>

  <p>It appears from Norman charters that the name of the place was Kirkby,
    a name, no doubt, bestowed upon it when church and hamlet were
    founded as a Christian settlement, in the old days when King Oswald
    of Northumbria embraced the new faith, an event probably commemorated
    by the cross which gave name to the wapentake still known of Oswald‚Äôs
    or Osgod‚Äôs Cross. Kirkby, however, is not named in Domesday, though
    probably even then a burgh. It is evidently included in the manor of
    Tateshall, or Tanshelf, which belonged to the king, and appended to
    which was the soke of Manesthorp, Barnebi, and Silchestone. Tateshall
    formed, and still forms, a part of the town of Pontefract.</p>

  <p>No doubt this is the ‚ÄúTaddenes Scylf,‚Äù where, in 947, King Eadred
    received the fealty of Archbishop Wulfstan and the Northumbrian Witan,
    as recorded, with their speedy breach of it, in the Anglo-Saxon
    chronicle. The place must even then have been of importance, and there
    can be but little doubt that the Witan met on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span> the site of the later
    castle. Also it continued to be an important place, for at the Conquest
    it was a demesne of the Crown, and is recorded in Domesday as rated
    at ¬£20., having three mills, and containing a hospital for the poor.
    Domesday, no doubt, means Pontefract Castle, when it records that,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Omnis tornour sedet infra metam castelli Ilberti secundum primam
    mensuram et secundum novissimam mensuram sedet extra</span>.‚Äù <em>Meta</em>
    is here clearly the castle garth or boundary of its immediate lands,
    not the military <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> or curtain about the position, with
    respect to which no measurement could be in error, nor is it the
    Castelry, which was a much larger area.</p>

  <p>The parish of Pontefract, which is large, is composed of six townships,
    of which one is Pontefract proper. The parish is one of twenty
    composing the wapentake or hundred.</p>

  <p>Leland, who calls the fortress ‚ÄúSnorre Castle,‚Äù says that before
    the Conquest it belonged to Richard Aschenald, and then to Ailric,
    Sweine, and Adam, his son, grandson, and great grandson. This last had
    two daughters, married to Alex. de Crevequer and Adam de Montbegon.
    Dodsworth calls Aschenald, Aske, still a great Yorkshire name, and
    points out, what indeed is still very evident, that the Norman works
    stood in part on an artificial hill, on which no doubt stood the house
    of the English lord, dispossessed by the Conqueror.</p>

  <p>Ailric is a real person, and a Domesday landowner, and before the
    Conquest held many manors. Sweine was his son, and inherited, and gave
    a church and chapel to the monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs Church at Pontefract.
    Ailric held his lands, much reduced, under the Norman grantee, as did
    Sweine, and his son Adam Fitz Sweine, who founded Bretton Priory, and
    died about 1158, having been a very considerable person. Charters by
    both Sweine and Adam are found in the Pontefract cartulary.</p>

  <p>William <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> was at Castleford on the Aire in the winter of 1069, and as
    he stayed there three weeks he probably found the means of inspecting
    so strong a place as the English House at Kirkby, and when he granted
    the district to Ilbert de Lacy it may reasonably be supposed that he
    followed his usual practice of directing a castle to be built.</p>

  <p>Mr. Freeman suggests that the name of Pontefract may have arisen
    from some incident connected with this passage of the Aire; others
    have thought that, like Richmond and Montgomery, it was an imported
    name. Ordericus, however, as Mr. Freeman remarks, refers to it as
    <em>Fractus-Pons</em>, not <em>Pons-Fractus</em>, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Rex ... pr√¶peditur ad
    fracti pontis vada</span>,‚Äù as though the words were in a state of transition
    from a description to a proper name. The change of name certainly was
    adopted slowly, for while an early charter by Robert de Lacy, the
    second lord, has the passage, ‚Äú<span lang="la">de dominio suo de Kirkbi</span>,‚Äù a later one
    has ‚Äú<span lang="la">Deo et S·µó‚Å± Johanni et Monachis meis de Pontefract</span>,‚Äù while Hugh
    de Lanval, the intrusive lord, at least as late as 1120, employs the
    older name. Robert of Castleford, a good local authority, writing about
    a century after the event, says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span> the name commemorates the escape of
    a multitude of people from drowning, when a bridge broke down beneath
    them. There is, however, no river within two miles of Pontefract
    capable of drowning a multitude.</p>

  <p>Camden derives the name from the breaking down of a bridge or causeway
    that traversed the marshy valley still called the Wash, the springs of
    which rise close north-west of the castle and cross its approach from
    Knottingley, at Bubwith Houses, where, in the time of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, John
    Bubwith held lands <i lang="la">juxta veterem pontem de Pontefract</i>, about a
    quarter of a mile from the castle, which, indeed, proves the existence
    of a bridge, though not of a broken one. How water came to be here
    collected will be explained when the defences of the castle are treated
    of. Perhaps the real truth of the matter may lie in the suggestion
    of Hopkinson, that the castle was called after a place of that name
    belonging to De Lacy in Normandy.</p>

  <p>A few marks of Roman occupation have been discovered here, and but
    few. Legeolium, the station of the district, seems to have been at
    Castleford, three miles distant.</p>

  <p>But whatever may have been the origin of the fortress, or of its
    evidently pre-Norman earthworks, its recorded history commences
    with Ilbert de Lacy, to whom William granted Knottingley, a large
    portion of the wapentake, and other lands, including about 150
    manors, chiefly in the West Riding,‚Äîwhere they fill seven pages of
    Domesday-book,‚ÄîNottingham, and Lincoln, of which those in Yorkshire
    were erected into an Honour, whereof Pontefract, the strongest and
    most important place, became naturally the chief seat. Ilbert, though
    no doubt of near kin to the Herefordshire Lord of Ewyas and Holm-Lacy,
    was a different person. He is thought to have built Pontefract Castle
    before 1080, commencing it probably in consequence of the visit of the
    Conqueror, in 1069. If Sir H. Ellis be right, and the castle then built
    be that alluded to by the Domesday entry, it was speedily completed.
    Ilbert also endowed the chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement within the castle, which,
    in some form or other, long survived. He lived into the reign of Rufus,
    from whom he had a confirmation of his grants. By his wife, Hawise, he
    left Robert and Hugh.</p>

  <p>Robert de Lacy, called, from his birthplace, ‚Äúof Pontefract,‚Äù claims to
    have built Clitheroe, which has, indeed, been attributed to his second
    son. He also had a confirmation from Rufus. By Maud, his wife, he had
    Ilbert, who, with his father, on the death of Rufus, joined Curthose
    against Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and fought at Tenchbrai. Both were banished, and
    Robert was disseized of Pontefract in favour of William Transversus,
    and then of Hugh de la Val, or Lanval, who held it to the reign of
    Stephen. Robert finally regained the Honour, but King Henry claimed
    2,000 marcs, and de la Val had ¬£150. for the demesne lands, and 20
    knights‚Äô fees, which are entered in the Liber Niger in 1165 as held ‚Äú<span lang="la">de
    veteri feodo Pontisfracti</span>.‚Äù Robert confirmed some of de la Val‚Äôs grants
    to Nostel, and founded the Cluniac Priory of Pontefract.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

  <p>Ilbert de Lacy, next Lord of the Honour, fought at Northallerton, and
    was a zealous supporter of Stephen, on whose death he adhered to Henry
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> He married Alice, daughter of Gilbert de Gant, but died childless.</p>

  <p>Henry de Lacy, next brother, succeeded. To him is attributed the later
    Norman work in the castle. He appears in the Liber Niger as holding
    60 fees. Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> confirmed him in the Honour of Pontefract, and the
    other English and the Norman possessions of his family. 12 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> he
    was assessed upon 79¬Ω fees. He was a considerable church benefactor,
    and gave <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John‚Äôs Church and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas‚Äôs Hospital, both in
    Pontefract, to the priory there. He founded Kirkstall.</p>

  <p>Robert de Lacy, his son, and successor to the Honour, was present at
    the coronation of Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> He died childless in 1193.</p>

  <p>The heir, according to Dugdale, and in violation of an accepted rule
    of inheritance, was Albreda de Lizures, Robert‚Äôs uterine sister. Mr.
    Hunter, however, in his preface to the Pipe-roll of 31 Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> has
    shown that in all probability Albreda was the daughter of Robert
    de Lizures by a sister of Ilbert de Lacy, second of this name, and
    therefore Robert‚Äôs cousin, and heir of the full blood. This point
    is important as setting aside what has been regarded as a singular
    exception to an accepted law. Albreda married Richard FitzEustace,
    Constable of Chester.</p>

  <p>John, their son, who died before his mother, Lord of Pontefract and
    Constable of Chester, abandoned his House of Halton, took the name and
    arms of de Lacy, and died 1179, having married Alice de Vere.</p>

  <p>Roger de Lacy, son and heir. 5 Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> he received from his
    grandmother the Lacy lands. He visited the Holy Land with his father
    in King Richard‚Äôs train. 7 Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> he paid 2,000 marcs to have
    livery of the Honour of Pontefract, excepting the castle, which the
    king retained in his own hands, and to which he paid at least ten
    visits between 1205 and 1216. 1 John, he reopened the question of the
    de la Val 20 fees, for livery of which he paid 500 marcs; and 4 John,
    1203, the king addressed a letter to the tenants directing them to
    acknowledge Roger de Lacy as their lord. Though John continued to hold
    the Castle, he employed Roger in various important offices, and made
    him governor of the strong fortress of Ch√¢teau-Gaillard, on the Seine,
    in which he stood a very famous siege, only giving way when short of
    food, and deserted by the king. 13 John he paid scutage upon 47¬æ fees
    of his own land, besides others which he held in wardship. He seems to
    have been the baron who, in the absence of regular soldiers, led the
    Chester minstrels to the relief of Earl Ranulph, when surrounded by
    the Welsh. He was a great soldier, and an openhanded benefactor to the
    church, and deserved the line with which the monks of Hanlau began his epitaph:‚Äî</p>

  <p class="noindent">Earl Roger died a young man in 1211. He had married Maud de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span> Clare,

    Honour was in the king‚Äôs hands, and he seems to have made free with its
    revenues; for in 1213 he directed 300 marcs from its issues to be spent
    on the works at Corfe Castle.</p>

  <p>John de Lacy had seizin 20 September, 1213, and paid John 7,000
    marcs for livery of the Honour, less the castles of Pontefract and
    Durrington, which the king kept, and for the expenses of keeping which
    Peter FitzHerbert had an order on the Exchequer. John, who is styled
    in the writ John de Chester, joined the Barons against King John, and
    was duly excommunicated by the Pope. He married Margaret, co-heir of
    Saer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, by Hawise, Countess of Lincoln and
    co-heir of Ranulph, Earl of Chester and Lincoln. Early in the reign of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1232, on the death of Earl Ranulph, Hawise seems to have
    made over her earldom to her daughter‚Äôs husband, who bore the title
    till his death, in 1240.</p>

  <p>Edmund de Lacy, the son of Earl John and Margaret, was, by the
    contrivance of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, married to one of his foreign kinsfolk,
    Alice, daughter of the Marquis de Saluces. He inherited Pontefract, but
    did not assume the title of Lincoln, as he did not outlive his mother.
    He died 42 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1258, having built the House of the White
    Friars, near the Barbican, at Pontefract.</p>

  <p>Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, his son, was the greatest of his race.
    He married the heiress of Longspee, and in her right became Earl of
    Salisbury. He was in ward to the king, and in 1272 was knighted and
    made Governor of Knaresborough Castle. He walled the town of Denbigh,
    and commenced the Castle, which he is said to have left unfinished
    because his only surviving son was drowned in a draw-well in the Red
    Tower there. His other son had been killed by a fall from a tower at
    Pontefract.</p>

  <p>Having thus no son, Earl Henry surrendered his estates to the king,
    who regranted them, 28th December, 21 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, to him for life, with
    remainder to Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, and the heirs of his body.
    28 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Queen Margaret was a visitor at Pontefract Castle, and
    during a short hunting excursion to Brotherton, was there brought to
    bed suddenly of Thomas, called from his birthplace. It is said that the
    house in which she took refuge, with 20 acres of land, was enclosed in
    a wall and ditched, and granted by the tenure of keeping the wall in
    repair. Earl Henry died at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn, 1310, leaving a daughter,
    Alice, who married Thomas, eldest son and successor of Edmund Earl of
    Lancaster.</p>

  <p>Thomas Plantagenet, Earl of Lancaster, and, either by his wife Alice,
    or by his father‚Äôs grant, Earl of Lincoln, and Lord of Pontefract,
    succeeded. He was much at the castle, and probably refaced the lower
    part of the keep, built Swillington Tower, and no doubt some of the
    structures the bases of which remain in the main ward. He also in 1315
    built Dunstanborough, and added Lancaster‚Äôs Buildings to Kenilworth.
    Earl Thomas‚Äôs history is well known. From Boroughbridge Field he was
    taken to Pontefract Castle, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span> occupied by the weak and vindictive
    king. He was imprisoned in Swillington Tower, tried and condemned
    in the great hall, and, in 1322, executed on the hill which still
    bears his canonised name, a mile to the north-east. He was buried
    in the Priory. The patent creating Harcla, one of his captors, Earl
    of Carlisle, was dated from the castle, three days after the earl‚Äôs
    execution.</p>

  <p>Countess Alice, whose character was unhappily not so impregnable as
    her castle, married, secondly, Eubolo L‚ÄôEstrange, who died 9 Edw. <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    Her third husband was Hugh de Fresnes, called Earl of Lincoln. There
    was a fourth, earlier in the list, whose claims are doubtful. Alice
    died 1348, but Pontefract and the other possessions had already passed,
    under the regrant, to her husband‚Äôs brother.</p>

  <p>Henry Plantagenet, Earl of Lancaster, succeeded to his brother‚Äôs honour
    in 1324, and died 1345. Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> probably retained the castle. He
    was here in 1328. By Maud Chaworth Earl Henry had another Henry.</p>

  <p>Henry Plantagenet (Tort-col, or of Grismond), Earl of Derby, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, and,
    in 1351, Duke of Lancaster. He died 1361. Blanch, his second daughter
    by Isabel Beaumont, and co-heir, inherited Pontefract Castle and Honour.</p>

  <p>John Plantagenet, of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, married the heiress and
    became Lord of Pontefract. He resided much at Pontefract, and restored
    the works. When threatened by Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> he victualled and put the
    castle into a state of defence. 12 Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> he obtained by charter
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">jura regalia</span>‚Äù within the honour. Parts of the half-covered basements
    in the main ward appear to be of his time. He died 1399.</p>

  <p>Henry Plantagenet, of Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, afterwards Henry
    <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, son and heir, succeeded, being then in exile. Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, by
    confiscating the estates, provoked reprisals, which led to his own
    deposition. Pontefract Castle became his first prison, and the scene of
    his supposed murder. Since that event the castle has been vested in the
    Crown. Richard Scrope, archbishop of York, was here condemned to death
    in 1405, and at that time Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> was much here, putting down the
    Northern insurrections. Many of his instruments are hence dated between
    1405 and 1408.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>, much occupied with foreign wars, and having peace at home,
    had no occasion to make use of Pontefract, which seems to have been
    neglected in its military capacity; but here Charles, Duke of Orleans,
    taken at Agincourt, and James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> of Scotland, were long confined, both
    accomplished men and given to literature.</p>

  <p>With the civil dissensions that came under Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, the castle became
    again of importance. The Duke of Exeter, taken from sanctuary after
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alban‚Äôs, was here imprisoned; and in 1460, after the battle of
    Wakefield, Edward here took post, with his army encamped around. It
    was under the walls of the castle that Warwick killed his horse before
    the soldiers, saying, ‚ÄúLet him flee that flee will; I stay by him who
    stays by me.‚Äù It was in accordance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> this declaration that the king
    advanced from Pontefract next day, and defeated the Lancastrians at
    Towton. Edward‚Äôs father, Richard, Duke of York, and his brother, the
    Earl of Rutland, slain at Wakefield, had been buried at Pontefract. He
    now added his father‚Äôs head to his body, and removed the whole from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    John‚Äôs Church to Fotheringay. During Edward‚Äôs reverses and absence in
    Holland, the Lancastrians used Pontefract as a military prison.</p>

  <p>In 1463, Edward was again at Pontefract, and in 1478, when he was
    escorted thither in great state, and remained a week.</p>

  <p>The bloody celebrity of Pontefract was increased during the ascendancy
    of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who sent hither Rivers, Grey, Vaughan,
    and Hawse, to be executed without form of trial. Soon after his
    accession he erected the town into a municipal borough.</p>

  <p>The castle rose again briefly into notice in 1536, when Aske and the
    insurgents of the Pilgrimage of Grace appeared before it, and forced
    its surrender by Lord Darcy and the Archbishop of York, with more than
    a presumption of treachery. Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> was here in 1540. Two years
    later, Sir Henry Savile, as governor, had charge of several Scottish
    prisoners taken at Solway Moss.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth, towards the close of her reign, repaired the castle, and
    rebuilt the chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement within it. King James was here in
    1603, and made the castle and honour a part of the dower of his queen.
    He repeated his visit in 1616, and viewed the newly-established college
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement, within the castle. King Charles was here in 1625, soon
    after his accession.</p>

  <p>Pontefract was once more to become a place of military importance.
    Once the centre of the baronage of the north, it was now to appear
    as the rallying-place of the great aristocracy of Yorkshire, and of
    the Royal party. In 1642, when Charles lifted his standard at York,
    Pontefract Castle was garrisoned by a very strong force of local gentry
    and volunteers, with the gallant Sir William Lowther, of Swillington,
    as governor. Their courage was soon to be tried. After Marston Moor
    and the surrender of York, Sir T. Fairfax appeared before the castle,
    and in December, 1644, commenced its siege. The main attack seems to
    have been directed upon the north-west angle, where the Pix Tower was
    battered, and fell, bringing down part of the adjacent curtain with it.
    The enemy, however, did not storm, and the breach was made good with
    earth. Mines were then tried, and one was sprung near the King‚Äôs Tower,
    at the south-east angle. These were met by counter mines, for which the
    ground, a soft rock, was very favourable. Very many shafts were sunk
    near the walls in the main ward, and, no doubt, are still in existence.
    Both attack and defence were carried on with great spirit, but at last
    stores began to fail, and matters looked ill for the garrison. They
    were reduced to extremity when, on the 1st of March, Sir M. Langdale
    arrived with 2,000 men from Oxford, and forced Lambert to raise the
    siege, while he victualled and reinforced the garrison.</p>

  <p>The Parliament, however, was now in the ascendant, and in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span> days
    their forces were recruited, and again appeared before the place.</p>

  <p>This time regular trenches were opened, batteries thrown up, and a
    complete line of circumvallation laid out. This was of an oval figure,
    completely inclosing the castle and its outworks. The contained area,
    from the head of Micklegate by Knollys‚Äôs Hospital on the west, to
    Monk-hill near New Hall on the east, was 900 yards; and from Baghill
    on the south, to the middle of the Abbot‚Äôs Closes on the north, 700
    yards, and about 3,000 yards in girth. Upon this line, which in
    parts commanded the castle, were thrown up twelve regular places of
    arms, redans, or batteries, besides fl√®ches and lighter works on the
    intermediate curtains to beat off the frequent sallies of the garrison.
    General Sands commanded, and General Overton was governor of the town.
    New Hall, a large mansion of the Talbots, to the east of the castle and
    outside the lines, was entrenched, and occupied by Sir John Savile. The
    garrison held Swillington Tower, the tower of the great church, and
    Neville‚Äôs Mount, a cavalier thrown up by them within the barbican, and
    carrying a large iron gun. These advanced works were of great service,
    as they both retarded the siege works and protected the repeated
    sallies from the garrison.</p>

  <p>The trenches were opened in March, but it was the 24th of May before a
    battery was opened upon the keep. General Poyntz then took the command
    of the attack. It was, however, late in May before the church-tower
    was battered down, and the post, therefore, abandoned. Notwithstanding
    the disastrous news of Naseby, Lowther continued to hold out, and it
    was not until July 20th, after four months of siege, without further
    supply of stores or ammunition, and without a chance of relief, that he
    surrendered upon excellent terms. The fall of Pontefract was followed
    in three days by that of Sandal Castle, within signal of its towers.</p>

  <p>The Parliament spared Pontefract on account of its strength, and put in
    General Cottrell, with a garrison. The Royalists, however, were still
    strong in the district, and June 6th, 1648, it was recovered by the
    treason of Morrice, a renegade, but a man of courage. A garrison was
    quickly collected, and the castle became once more a Royalist centre.</p>

  <p>A third siege thus became necessary, and such was the strength of the
    place that, even discouraged as the Royalists were, it promised to be a
    troublesome one. General Rainsborough, who was appointed, met his death
    before taking the command, which fell at first to Sir H. Cholmley.
    Cromwell himself was present for a time, and a work on the north front
    bore his name. He left Lambert in command. Meantime, the king‚Äôs death
    had broken up the party; and ultimate success being impossible, the
    governor, Morrice, listened to terms. He himself and some others were
    excepted by name. The difficulty thus created was ingeniously evaded.
    The excepted persons being reduced to three, they were walled up in
    one of the subterranean chambers, well provided with food and air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
    and Lambert was made to believe that they had escaped. The place was
    then surrendered, Lambert entered March 24th, 1649, and as he did not
    retain the place, the three culprits got away safely. Parliament now
    ordered the castle to be demolished, and the only record of the details
    of its parts is that preserved in the schedule of its destruction. The
    materials‚Äîtimber, lead, glass, and iron, sold for ¬£1,779. 17<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, of
    which ¬£777. 4<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was the cost of demolition, ¬£1,000 was paid to the
    town, and the balance of ¬£2. 12<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> went to the Commonwealth. This
    last creditor, however, received afterwards some arrears amounting to
    ¬£145. 11<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 7<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, and so, in an account of profit and loss, was wound
    up the history of one of the strongest and greatest fortresses in the
    North.</p>

  <h3>DESCRIPTION.</h3>

  <p>The position and dimensions of the castle were worthy of the great
    barons by whom it was constructed, and far too noble for the events
    with which its name is associated. North-east of, and one-third of
    a mile from, the market-cross of Pontefract, there is seen a very
    remarkable table of rock, oval in form, the sides of which are in
    part a steep slope and in part a cliff of from 30 feet to 40 feet
    high, rising out of a talus, which, on the north, south, and eastern
    faces, descends into two deep natural valleys, which unite on the
    north-eastern front. At the south-west end is also a natural depression
    dividing the rock from the town, and which has been deepened somewhat
    by art, as has the cliff been scarped and, where necessary, revetted,
    so that the general result was the production of an almost impregnable
    stronghold. This description, however, requires, as regards the east
    front, some little addition. Here, immediately beyond the wall, is a
    ditch nearly all artificial, and beyond it a nearly level area, beyond
    which, again, is the natural valley. As it was necessary to cover the
    ground, it was walled and converted into what was called the barbican,
    but was really a double ward outside the castle, covering its main
    entrance. The castle was thus composed of the main ward, occupying the
    table-rock, and the outer and inner barbicans covering its south-east
    front and entrance.</p>

  <p>The main ward occupies the whole summit of the rock. It is in plan an
    irregular oval, 150 yards north-east and south-west, and 103 yards
    in its cross diameter. Of this area a segment at the south-west end,
    37 yards deep or on the ‚Äúsagitta,‚Äù is occupied by a raised platform
    containing the keep and remains of various buildings, and a smaller
    segment at the north-east end is occupied by the bases of other
    buildings, including the chapel. If the arrangement be likened to the
    deck of a ship, the keep end will be the poop, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, the other end the
    forecastle, and the large intermediate space the waist.</p>

  <p>The present appearance of the north-eastern platform is a bank of
    earth, irregular, and about 20 feet above the area level. In plan
    it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span> is rather semilunar, and is evidently composed of the basements
    and ruins of buildings, the soft red sandstone of which readily
    becomes converted into soil. The face towards the ward, standing
    from 2 feet to 6 feet high, shows the base mouldings and plinth of a
    range of buildings that rose from the main ward level, and seems to
    have included a polygonal tower or turret. All that is visible is of
    excellent ashlar, with stones of large size, and the workmanship is
    mainly in the Perpendicular style. In the rear, along the edge of a
    cliff, is the curtain-wall, part of which is a revetment filling up the
    irregularities of the rock. This platform is returned a few yards along
    the east front against the curtain, and there is seen the basement of
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement‚Äôs Chapel, more than once rebuilt since its first Norman
    foundation.</p>

  <p>The curtain along the crest, where the cliff is high, seems to have
    been a mere parapet. On the north-east point, where there is only a
    slope, the curtain is very lofty, and of prodigious thickness; much is
    broken away, but what remains shows it to have been 15 feet thick, at
    its base and 11 feet at 24 feet high. The main gate was in the curtain
    near the south end. It seems, from the drawings, to have been covered
    by a small square tower, the exterior and interior portals not being
    opposite.</p>

  <p>The main interest of the castle attaches to its south-western platform.
    This is about 20 feet above the main ward, and at its southern angle
    there is raised upon it a conical mound, flat-topped, and rising about
    as high again.</p>

  <p>Towards the main ward this platform is supported by a revetment wall
    from 12 feet to 14 feet high, of good rough ashlar, of large stones,
    having a base of 4 feet, and above this a plinth of about 4 feet
    more, the two offsets being plain chamfers. This, no doubt, carried a
    curtain wall. In the wall, near its centre, is a broad-arched recess,
    called ‚Äúthe King‚Äôs Seat,‚Äù probably from a tradition that Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>
    sat there, which is probable enough. At the north end the platform is
    returned about 25 yards along the west curtain. Various indications
    show that this platform was covered with buildings, most of which, like
    the retaining wall, were of Norman date, and of which the basements
    remain, though much covered up. Of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, or curtain-wall
    that supports the outer face of this platform, only the lower 30 feet,
    or revetment, remains. This commences some way down the slope, and is
    prodigiously strong, and built against the rock. At the south-west
    angle was the Treasurer‚Äôs or Pix Tower, the ruins of which still
    encumber the slope. Passing southward, the wall rises and becomes more
    perfect. In its exterior base, about 30 feet below the rampart, is a
    Norman postern, very perfect, and which probably was in the base of the
    old Red Tower. Then, behind, and on the level with the top of the wall,
    are remains of early buildings. One presents the end of a round-headed
    vault of about 16 feet span, of rude rubble, but springing from good
    ashlar walls, and having a later-inserted window. This is called ‚ÄúKing
    Richard‚Äôs Prison.‚Äù Near this is a rectangular shaft, 8 feet by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span> 4
    feet, but which, a few feet down, is increased to eight feet square, a
    round-headed arch supporting the upper half. It is now about 40 feet
    deep, and dry. It is called a well, but is more probably the shaft of a
    garderobe.</p>

  <p>Beyond this rises the mound, the top of which is circular, and about
    20 yards across, and 40 feet to 50 feet above the main ward, and much
    more above the exterior base of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of which it forms
    a part. Those who formed the mound no doubt gave it a natural slope
    all round, and placed their structure on its top, and, making it a
    part of their line of defence, carried the general palisade to its
    summit from either side. The Normans, on taking possession, proceeded
    in a different way. They cut the soft rock, forming the core of the
    mound, on the outer sides, into the figure of a three-quarter round
    mural tower, and then faced it with a very solid wall, so that though
    really a solid bastion, it had all the appearance of a magnificent
    half-engaged round tower, 70 feet diameter. When this segmental bastion
    had been carried to a height of 50 feet or 60 feet, that is, to the
    level of the top of the mound, the wall was continued all round, and
    the cylinder completed, so that the mound was crowned by a regular
    shell keep of 60 feet diameter, and probably 25 feet high, which was
    really, what its substructure only seemed to be,‚Äîa tower of masonry.
    As the rock was of irregular figure, this process was repeated, and a
    second smaller bastion was formed to the north, and probably a third.
    Leland speaks of the donjon as composed of three large and three small
    roundlets; of these only two now remain. These grand bastions still
    form the finest part of the castle, standing high above the road
    from the railway station into the town, upon the crest of a steep
    slope. They are faced with large blocks of sandstone, of excellent
    open-jointed ashlar work, with a bold set-off at the base. Advantage
    was taken of the soft character of the rock to excavate the interior
    into cells and staircases, some of which are still open. In the large
    bastion, at its exterior base, near a covering angle, a shoulder-headed
    doorway, a postern, opens into a round-headed passage, partly cut in
    the rock, and partly vaulted. From this one way leads into a mural
    chamber; another up a steep flight of steps, cut in the rock, but
    having a series of shoulder-headed hanging arches to support the roof.
    At a height of 30 feet this stair leads to an open gallery above,
    commanding the postern, and from this again ascends, covered, to the
    base of the keep proper. Boothroyd gives three other excavations,
    one of which contained the well mentioned by Leland. Besides these
    the remaining fragments of the keep proper contained the base of
    a well-stair, probably ascending to the battlements, and a shaft,
    probably from a garderobe about that level.</p>

  <p>The main entrance to the castle was a few yards east of the keep, in
    the south curtain. From the gate a narrow stair ran up the curtain into
    the keep, and is still seen. Another, on the other side, still descends
    from the keep towards King Richard‚Äôs prison.</p>

  <p>From the keep a spur wall descends the slope, and was intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span> to
    cover the approach, as at Hawarden and Coningsborough. It evidently
    crossed the ditch, and formed part of the barbican. Thus the keep could
    be reached rapidly and directly by three ways, all narrow and well
    defended,‚Äîone from the outside by a postern, another from the main
    gate, and a third from the west ramparts. In substance the masonry and
    arrangement of this keep is clearly Norman, but the whole has been
    refitted, and no doubt refaced in the Perpendicular period.</p>

  <p>Mention must be made of a very curious and early excavation in the main
    ward. On the surface, a few feet from the king‚Äôs seat, a flight of
    rock-cut steps descends nearly north-west, and at 70 feet distant is
    the mouth of a square shaft, lighting the passage below. Descending,
    thirty-three steps lead steeply down a gallery, 4 feet broad, with
    a hanging roof. A little way down, on the right, are traces of a
    cylindrical staircase, no doubt the original way in, but now destroyed,
    with the tower, in the base of which it no doubt was contained. At
    the foot of the stairs is a plain round-headed door-case, apparently
    of late Norman date. Beyond this the stairs recommence, and ten steps
    lower the descent ceases and the passage forks, a short branch running
    north, and another, a trifle longer, east. Before the fork, part of the
    passage is vaulted in fine-jointed ashlar, with two plain round-headed
    ribs. In the wall, on the right, is a round-headed recess for a lamp,
    and the commencement of another passage, also round-headed, but left
    as a mere recess. Above the fork opens the shaft, here seen to be a
    truncated pyramid, about 6 feet by 12 feet, and 30 feet deep. At the
    fork the salient is occupied by two small oblong cells, with pointed
    roofs. They communicate with each other and the passages by narrow
    lancet doorways. The excavation is now called the magazine, and no
    doubt was so used at the siege; but it is of Norman and early English
    date, and probably was intended for a cellar. The arrangements of the
    cells are scarcely suitable for a prison. The present entrance is
    clearly an addition, opened when the well staircase was disused.</p>

  <p>There remain some exterior points to be noticed. Leaving the keep by
    its postern, and going north-west along the foot of the west face, the
    wall is seen evidently to be Norman, and near the centre of this front
    is the original Norman postern. There are upon the face of the wall two
    broad shallow pilaster strips, 8 feet broad by 6 inches projection,
    between which is a plain round-headed relieving arch, and below it a
    segmental-headed doorway, of 4 feet opening, without portcullis, but
    with a rebate for a door, and holes for two stout bars. This opens
    into a straight vaulted passage, about 5 feet broad, lofty, also
    round-headed, of excellent ashlar, and clearly Norman. It runs about
    15 feet, and is then choked up. It possibly ends in a well-stair, and
    might readily be excavated. In later, probably Perpendicular times,
    this postern has been disused, and the door converted into a loop, and
    blocked with the usual window-steps within.</p>

  <p>Following the base of the cliff along the north front, it is seen to
    have been carefully made good with masonry; and at the north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>-west
    angle, under what was Queen‚Äôs Tower, a large rift in the rock has been
    lined with ashlar, and spanned by a round-headed arch in good masonry.
    It looks like a large cavalry postern, but is merely a recess. At the
    foot of the talus on the west front, and about 180 yards outside the
    wall, are the remains of Swillington Tower, an outwork built by Thomas
    Earl of Lancaster, and in which he is said to have been imprisoned.
    About half of the basement remains. The tower was 46 feet square, with
    walls 10 feet 6 inches thick. It was intended to command the approach
    from the north, and was of great use during the siege as a flanking
    defence. Doubtless a double wall connected it with the main ward; but
    of this there is no trace.</p>

  <p>It would seem that at Pontefract, as at many inland castles, a dam was
    thrown across a valley below the place, and thus provision made for
    defence and for the working of a mill. This seems to have been the case
    here below the northern front. The valley was converted into a lake,
    employed to feed two mills, of one of which traces remained in 1806,
    and the other, the lower mill, was removed in 1766, when the dam was
    levelled, and the pool converted into a meadow. Bubwith Bridge, no
    doubt, crossed this pool, at what is still called ‚Äúthe Wash.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Nearly all traces of the Barbican are gone, but its memory and site
    are preserved in Barbican House, Row, and Garden, and there remains a
    fragment, probably of the lower gate, between Ass Hill and the Castle
    chain. There were two approaches, one from the town and one from the
    great church, which met in the outer ward of the Barbican. In front of
    the north entrance there still remains a good but late Tudor House,
    into the front of which has been inserted a grand old stone heater
    shield, bearing the three lions of England and a label of three points,
    carved in bold relief, a relic probably of the royal occupation of the
    castle. The style of the shield is early, and the blazon points to the
    eldest son of a king of England, before Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> introduced the
    lilies of France.</p>

  <p>Boothroyd‚Äôs bird‚Äôs-eye view gives a general notion of the castle before
    it was destroyed. There were eight mural towers,‚Äîthe Keep, the Red
    Tower, the Treasurer‚Äôs or Pix Tower, Swillington Tower in advance of
    the wall, the Queen‚Äôs Tower, the King‚Äôs Tower, Constable‚Äôs Tower, and
    the Gatehouse. All, save the keep, were rectangular, perhaps Norman. Of
    these only the keep and the ruins of Pix Tower are traceable: the rest,
    with the great hall, kitchens, and lodgings, were carefully removed by
    the Parliamentary contractor, though probably a few pounds spent in
    excavation would still show the basements, and establish a general plan.</p>

  <p>Looking to the general evidence afforded by the remains of this castle,
    it is clear that it was a strong place in pre-Norman times; those who
    fortified it placing the mound at what was naturally its weakest point.</p>

  <p>The greater part of the remaining masonry is Norman, and not improbably
    early. The <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall, the buildings connected with it on the
    west platform, the rear wall of the platform, the old postern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span> the
    interior of the keep, and the magazine, all seem to be in substance
    Norman. Of the early English and Decorated periods very slight traces
    are left visible; but it is clear that under the House of Lancaster,
    in the Perpendicular period, much was added. Probably, the buildings
    on the north-east platform were constructed. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement‚Äôs Chapel was
    rebuilt, Swillington Tower added, the keep refaced, and much done in
    repairing the chambers and staircases within.</p>

  <p>Boothroyd, whose history, with all its imperfections, should be
    mentioned with respect, gives a copy of the account rendered for
    the destruction of the works, a plan of the siege operations, and a
    bird‚Äôs-eye view of the castle.</p>

  <p>Ruined as is the place, and for many years reduced to be a mere garden
    of liquorice, enough remains to interest very deeply those who are
    conversant with our ancient military structures, and especially such
    of them as are of Saxon or English foundation, and have been recast to
    suit the Norman fashions of defence.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH England is rich in Roman remains, and full of material traces
    of the all-pervading energy of that race of conquerors and colonists,
    such remains are chiefly roads, encampments, foundations of domestic
    buildings, and less frequently of fortresses or military works in
    masonry. Of these latter the chief are Burgh, Caerleon, Caerwent,
    Caistor, Pevensey, Richborough, and Silchester; parts of Colchester,
    Lincoln, Wroxeter, and York, and a few traces at Chester and Leicester.
    But of these, not inconsiderable remains, none are to be compared for
    completeness of preservation, and but few for extent of area, with Porchester.</p>

  <p>That Porchester is a Roman work is unquestionable, though this
    certainty is not derived from its early history, of which little has
    been preserved, but from the evidence afforded by its plan, materials,
    and workmanship, confirmed in some measure by the relation of its walls
    to the additions of the Norman period; also, an undoubted Roman way
    connects Porchester with Venta Belgarum or Winchester.</p>

  <p>This celebrated fortress is built upon a low point of land which
    projects into the inner or northern part of Portsmouth Harbour,
    dividing that spacious and secluded inlet into two heads, and
    expressing in its name both its position and its character. It is
    placed about 3 miles above the narrow entrance which, flanked by the
    towns of Portsmouth and Gosport, is the passage from the larger and
    exterior roadstead of Spithead.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In its present and tolerably perfect condition, Porchester is a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>walled enclosure, square or nearly so, containing within its area
    close upon 9 acres. The investing walls measure, by the larger Ordnance
    survey, 210 yards north and south, and 207 yards east and west. They
    range from 15 feet to 40 feet high, and from 6 feet to 10 feet thick.
    They were supported outside by four mural bastions on each face, and
    one at each angle, in all twenty, of which six have at various times
    been removed, two from the east, one from the north and from the west,
    and two from the north-west and south-east angles. Those bastions
    which remain are half-round, 19 feet to 20 feet in diameter, and have
    slightly prolonged and flattened sides. The angle bastions are of the
    same pattern. That to the north-west was removed to make way for the
    keep; that to the south-east has fallen, undermined by the sea. The two
    remaining are open at the gorge, as are the two upon the east front.
    The rest are closed, and probably all were originally so, for the
    interior work is very rough indeed, and seems intended to have been
    concealed with earth and rubbish, as was often the fashion in Roman
    bastions. Probably some of those now open have been cleared out by the
    Norman architect, to make use of the interior, but the gorge wall of
    one of those to the south has recently given way, and the interior is
    seen rough as the Roman builders left it. These bastions at present,
    with one exception, rise no higher than the curtain, no doubt their
    original condition, but it seems probable that the Normans raised a
    story upon them, and thus converted them into mural towers. They stand
    from 41 yards to 42 yards apart, from centre to centre, the distances
    being slightly unequal. On the west face the two bastions flanking the
    gate are 48 yards asunder.</p>

  <p>The walls are built mainly of flint nodules, laid in courses with as
    thick or even thicker, beds of mortar. Occasionally are seen single
    and double flat courses of red tiles and tile-stone, and sometimes of
    herring-bone work, characteristic peculiarities, especially strongly
    marked in the bastions. The work seems late in the Roman period. The
    walls have been patched with Caen stone, and by later builders with
    coursed flint, and more recently with brick. Here and there the parapet
    may be Norman, but this can scarcely be the case with much of it, which
    must have been frequently renewed. The two missing bastions to the
    east, to judge by the patching up, were probably gone when the Normans
    took possession. One on the west face was evidently standing in the
    Perpendicular period; that at the south-east angle fell but a few years
    ago. There is still an east and west, a water and a land gateway, nor
    do there appear to have been more in the Roman period.</p>

  <p>The east face is washed by the sea, here a good defence, because too
    shallow for boats, and too deep for land operations. On this face the
    curtain is especially high, reaching 40 feet, and at the base of its
    parapet is a row of small holes, as though to carry a timber gallery or
    <i lang="la">br√©tasche</i>, no doubt a post-Norman addition. Between the south
    face and the sea there intervenes a triangular strip of flat land, at
    its widest end 60 yards broad. To command this, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span> protect the foot
    of the wall, a berm or platform of earth has been thrown up against the
    wall, about 6 feet high and 24 feet broad, in front of which is a light
    ditch, prolonged westward to the advanced ditch to check any approach
    round the angle of the place. The curtain here is about 30 feet high.</p>

  <p>On the north front the margin of land is much broader, and is cut
    off by a deep and broad ditch communicating with the sea, and which
    turns the north-west angle, and extends along the west or main front
    nearly as far as the great gate; it would seem that originally this
    ditch covered the whole front, and extended onward to the sea, but the
    drawbridge of the gate has been replaced by a causeway, and the further
    traces of the ditch are but faint, as it has been filled up south of
    the causeway with some care.</p>

  <p>In addition to these special defences the whole work is covered by
    a deep ditch with a high interior bank of earth, which has been cut
    from sea to sea right across the tongue on which the castle stands.
    This is about 300 yards in length, and from 50 yards to 100 yards to
    the west of or in advance of the west front, forming a broken curve
    with its salient near the centre. In outline it is rude, and as it
    bears no trace of masonry was probably stockaded. The notch for the
    entrance is placed considerably to the north of the main gate, so that
    the approach was oblique and exposed to be enfiladed from the castle.
    This work looks rather like an English addition before the arrival of
    the Normans. There is no trace of any rectangular camp or earthwork of
    earlier date than the walls. They are built upon the natural ground,
    and there is little or no difference between the interior and exterior
    level. In what condition the Romans left, or their successors found,
    the works which have thus been described, is not known. So convenient
    an enclosure, so well posted, could scarcely have been neglected by
    any people. In Domesday, ‚ÄúPorcestre‚Äù is a manor, and is the subject
    of a long and rather detailed entry. Mention is made of a ‚Äúhalla,‚Äù or
    mansion-house, or hall, but none of the castle. It had possibly been
    disused as a fortress, though probably then and long before a parish,
    with a church within its girth.</p>

  <p>The Normans were for a time content with the existing wall; for it was
    not till about 1133 that Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> here founded a priory for Augustine
    canons, and built the small and plain, but very complete, Church of
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, which was also the parish church, and most of which remains
    uninjured. Probably a little before this, judging from the internal
    evidence of the buildings, he proceeded to convert the Roman into a
    Norman fortress. This was effected by placing a rectangular keep at
    the north-west angle, about 10 feet in advance of the line of wall,
    removing for this purpose about 60 feet of the adjacent curtain on
    each face, and the capping bastion of the angle. The projection of the
    keep is mainly inwards. It seems to rest upon the natural soil, at
    that corner slightly elevated. It has been thought to stand upon an
    artificial knoll, but more probably its base has been banked round by
    the earth removed from the ditch, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span> is here both deep and broad.
    The keep required defence from the large interior court, as well as
    from the field. To afford this, and also to divide the castle from the
    church, Henry further enclosed a base-court, of about 67 yards east
    and west, by 47 yards north and south, or about one-fourteenth of the
    whole area, in which detached space the keep stood, and of which the
    great curtain formed the north and west sides. The entrance was in the
    south face, near the south-east angle, and this inner wall was covered
    by a wet ditch, fed by a culvert in the north curtain from the exterior
    tidal ditch, and which completed the isolation of the inner from the
    outer ward.</p>

  <p>The church was placed in the south-east corner of the outer ward,
    diagonally opposite to the new ward, to which its enclosure
    corresponded. The conventual buildings stood against the church on
    the south side, and extended to the Roman curtain, which bears marks
    of Norman alteration. At Caister, in Norfolk, where the parish church
    stands within a similar enclosure, it occupies the south-west angle.
    The wall which, it is probable, cut off the monastery from the rest of
    the outer ward, is gone. The western or landward gatehouse of the outer
    ward was remodelled after the Norman fashion, but the eastern or water
    gate was left unaltered.</p>

  <p>The keep answers to the usual conditions of such structures. It
    measures at its exterior base 65 feet north and south, by 52 feet
    east and west; and was, as originally built, about 55 feet, and as
    completed, 100 feet high. On its west front three broad pilaster
    strips, of slight projection, rise from the ground, independently of
    the plinth, to rather above half the present height of the tower. On
    the north front the arrangement is the same, save that the lower half
    of the pilaster to the east is united with the wall of the forebuilding
    that covered the entrance to the keep, on the east face. The south
    face has only two pilasters, that in the centre being omitted. The
    east face is again different; here the basement is covered by the
    forebuilding, and there is but one pilaster, at the north end. These
    pilasters in the north, west, and south faces, rise plain to the
    second-floor level, where both wall and pilasters are reduced by a
    set-off. The wall is not again reduced, but the pilasters have two or
    three rapid sets-off before they die into the wall. Near that was the
    base level of the original parapet. The angles are solid,‚Äîthat is,
    without nooks. The two pilasters covering the south-west angle have a
    slightly bolder projection than the rest, and contain a well-stair,
    the head of which opens in a low turret. There are no turrets nor
    trace of them at the other three angles. They were the natural finish
    of the pilasters covering the angles, and as these are not carried to
    the summit it is possible that the usual turrets were also omitted.
    The present battlement is probably in substance of Decorated date. The
    north and south parapets are horizontal, but those to the east and
    west rise to the centre so as to form a very low-pitched gable, a very
    unusual outline in such a building, and for which there is nothing in
    the arrangement of the roof to account. The exterior of the keep is
    very free from ornament. The only exception is a string-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>course about
    12 feet above the base on the west wall, which has on its under side
    a billet moulding of great delicacy. This string is confined to this
    face, and to the wall, being stopped by the pilasters.</p>

  <p>The material of the keep, inside and out, is chiefly of Caen stone
    ashlar for facing, with hearting of chalk flints. The stones are from
    4 inches to 6 inches square on the face; high up they are perhaps a
    little larger, but there is little difference between the original work
    and the additions. The stones of the parapet are still larger, and
    seem, from the accounts, to have come from the Isle of Wight.</p>

  <p>The walls at the base average about 11 feet thick, and at the first
    floor about 7 feet. At the summit they are about 6 feet, the reduction
    in thickness being thus unusually small. The interior is divided
    throughout by a cross wall running east and west, from 5 feet to 3
    feet 6 inches thick. It has a basement and four floors. The entrance
    was in the first floor, and a spiral stair, the only one, occupied the
    south-west angle and rose from the first floor, and it may be from the
    base, to the battlements, communicating with, probably, each floor,
    by doors, of which all but one are walled up. In the south-east angle
    was the pipe of the well, with similar communications. The floors
    throughout were of timber, the beams resting in holes in the wall. The
    interior sets-off, reducing the thickness of the wall, are irregular.</p>

  <p>The two basement chambers are not quite equal, the southern being
    the larger. They are about 12 feet high, each has a loop in its west
    end and two in the north and south walls, six in all; these are of 6
    inches opening, round-headed, and placed in splays of an hour-glass
    section, having recesses inside and out of 2 feet opening. The door to
    the well-pipe is visible, though blocked, but that to the stair seems
    to have been closed and obliterated. Each of these chambers is vaulted
    with a low-pointed barrel, running east and west, and stiffened by six
    very deep slender ribs, with hollow chamfers. These have been cut away
    from the vault, but the gable ribs remain attached to the wall, and
    sections of the others are seen at their springings. This work looks
    early Perpendicular, or, perhaps, a little earlier. It is excellent,
    and much too good for a cellar, though no doubt intended specially
    for the custody of the royal prisage wines, which formed a part of
    the revenue, and were often stored here. There is a door between the
    vaults, near the west end of the cross-wall, and an outer door in the
    east wall of the south vault, which latter was probably opened when the
    vaults were turned, and the spiral stair closed. This, however, may be
    an original door opening from the basement into a dungeon in the base
    of the forebuilding, or it may have been connected with an outer door
    in the forebuilding itself. It is difficult to be sure on this point.</p>

  <p>The first floor is also of two chambers, 43 feet long, and 21 feet
    and 18 feet 6 inches broad. These floors contain the two state-rooms,
    which, to the timber ceiling, were 24 feet high. In the north and south
    walls are, in each two windows, round-headed, of 2 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span> opening, of
    hour-glass section, with splays of 3 feet opening outside, and 5 feet
    inside. The sill of the recess is 4 feet above the floor, and the
    recess 12 feet high. Its angles are occupied by a bold bead or engaged
    shaft, with bases and foliated caps, whence the bead is carried round
    the head. Besides these four windows, in each west end is another, of
    the same character, but with recesses 20 feet high, and without beaded
    angles. The two south windows were probably walled up when the exterior
    smaller hall was added, and light ceased to be an object in the keep.
    In the north chamber the west window is also closed. The doors to the
    well-shaft and the stair have been closed in modern times. In the cross
    wall is a large modern breach. The old door was near the west end;
    also, in the south-west angle of the north room, a door opened into a
    small garderobe in the west wall. This is partially bricked up, but the
    loop is seen in the central pilaster, outside. The main entrance of
    the castle is on this floor, in the east wall of the south chamber. It
    is round-headed, of 4 feet 6 inches opening, perfectly plain, without
    chamfer or rebate, which, no doubt, has been cut off. It is evidently
    original. There are two doors in the east wall of the north chamber,
    but they are modern openings.</p>

  <p>The second floor, 13 feet high, was the attic of the original building,
    and a mere series of lofts. The roof was very singular. Over the
    cross wall was a central ridge, and over the middle of each chamber a
    valley or gutter, from which the roofs rose to the outer walls. As a
    lean-to, there was, therefore, in the cross section, a central triangle
    divided by the cross wall, and on each side a half-triangle, formed
    by the outer wall; and in each of the four half gables thus formed
    in the east and west walls was a small round-headed window, eight in
    all. The windows remain, as does the stone weather-table, by which the
    section of the early roof is indicated. The roofs were steep, and,
    therefore, no use could be made of them as a platform for machines of
    defence or for storing missiles. In the cross wall, here 3 feet thick,
    is a tall, very plain, round-headed door, of 2 feet 6 inches opening,
    communicating between the halves of the division of the central roof.
    The south loft was reached by the well-stair, but how the three
    northern lofts were reached does not appear. In the north chamber,
    under the southernmost of the two east windows, are traces of a door,
    which no doubt led to the battlements of the forebuilding, covering
    the main door, as seen at Scarborough and Richmond, and elsewhere. The
    arrangement of the original roof resembles that of Helmsley, a very
    late keep, which also has been raised.</p>

  <p>Soon after the completion of this roof, and within the Norman period,
    it was decided to raise the keep two stages, by which means the roof
    attics were converted into a regular second floor. Something of this
    kind was done at Richmond and at Bridgenorth.</p>

  <p>The third floor, then built, is 18 feet high. It is quite plain,
    without an opening in the cross wall, and with one small window in each
    west wall. How the north chamber was entered is not known.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> The present
    floor is from 3 feet to 4 feet above the original one. The next is the
    fourth or upper floor, about 15 feet high, with a cross wall 3 feet 6
    inches thick, of rough rubble, while the outer walls are of ashlar on
    both faces. The south chamber has four windows; those in the south wall
    of two lights, flat-headed, but under a full-centred arch of relief
    outside, and within placed in a recess, also full-centred, of 5 feet 6
    inches opening. All these are quite plain. There is a similar window
    in the east end. The west end window is of similar pattern, but with
    a single light; and of the north chamber, two windows in the north
    side and one in each end are also of one light. In the east wall of
    this chamber a small door opens by an L-shaped mural passage turning
    the north-east angle into a garderobe, having a loop in the east wall,
    and a vent opening directly outwards on the face of the north wall. At
    Brougham is a similar arrangement for an oratory. In the south jamb
    of the west window of the south room a small oven has been excavated.
    As this could not be reached from the old floor level, it is probably
    very modern. Whether the well-pipe is brought up through the new work
    does not appear, nor is there any trace of an original opening from
    the turnpike stair, though probably there was one. The door in the
    cross-wall, of 4 feet 6 inches opening and full-centred, is placed near
    the west end. This has a rebate, so that the door opened into the north
    chamber, and was bolted on that side.</p>

  <p>The original roof of the Norman addition was flat, as shown by a bold
    weather-table carried round the walls; but the actual present roof is
    exactly the reverse of that described below, there being a central
    and two side gutters, and a ridge over the centre of each chamber,
    an equally impracticable roof for a defensive platform. The flat or
    nearly flat roof much resembled that now upon the White Tower, London.
    The parapet can be examined from the top. The embrasures are at long
    intervals, and 4 feet 6 inches deep by 2 feet 3 inches opening. No
    traces of angle turrets are seen save at the stair-head, and that is
    but a small affair. No fireplace has been discovered in the keep, and
    only two mural chambers, both very small, for garderobes. The absence
    of ornament or of any very well marked state room with mural closets,
    is probably due to the construction at the same time with the keep of
    more convenient domestic buildings in the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The forebuilding was part of the original design of the keep, of the
    lower part of which it is a prolongation, of the same breadth, and 25
    feet deep, eastward. Its walls, as thick as those of the keep, also
    contained two chambers, divided by a cross wall, east and west. The
    northern chamber is now filled up, and possibly always was so. The
    southern chamber seems originally to have had no outlet, and if used as
    a dungeon or cellar, it was probably reached by a trap in the timber
    floor.</p>

  <p>The first floor of this structure, at the level of the same floor of
    the keep, was divided also into two chambers, between which was a
    passage, which led from an outer stair to the door of the keep. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
    north chamber has been defiled by use as a dust-house and garderobe
    for modern prisoners in the keep; but an elegant oriel window in the
    late Perpendicular style inserted into its north wall shows that it has
    been a room of some pretension. The south chamber was the chapel of the
    keep. In its west wall, the wall of the keep, is a large full-centred
    recess, about 11 feet broad and 2 feet deep, for a seat, and in the
    south wall remains half a Norman window, which originally opened into
    the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The original roof of the forebuilding had rather a high pitch, of
    which, over the chapel, the weather-table remains. This was superseded
    by a higher roof, but at a very low pitch, suitable for lead. The top
    of both roofs reached nearly to the level of the floor of the second
    story of the keep. The battlements of this accessory tower were 15 feet
    to 20 feet below those of the original keep. The approach to the first
    floor of the forebuilding was by an exterior staircase of twenty-six
    steps, placed against its east wall, so as to reach the outer door
    about the centre of the building, and leading on also to the north
    curtain. The present staircase is modern, but a careful examination
    will show Norman remains about its base. It would seem that when the
    keep was raised it was decided to make a door in the south wall of the
    forebuilding into the space below the chapel. When this was done the
    wall was thickened on the outside. The door still remains, but opens no
    longer into the open court, but into the basement of a later building.
    Part of the added facing has fallen off, and the old wall is seen,
    with a billeted string corresponding to that upon the keep. In later
    times a Perpendicular window has been opened in the chapel wall above,
    and a second Perpendicular door into the space below. This is the door
    which has over it the arms of Queen Elizabeth in stone, and which was
    probably made by some earlier monarch to admit the wine-tuns into the
    vaults of the keep.</p>

  <p>The inner ward is still bounded to the east and south by the original
    Norman wall of Caen stone, 6 feet thick. The original domestic
    buildings were ranged along the south side to the west of the entrance,
    as traces of the original walling still show. At the south-eastern
    angle was a large rectangular tower, of 23 feet breadth by 25 feet
    projection, placed diagonally,‚Äînot a usual Norman arrangement. The
    walls are 6 feet thick, and the gorge is open. It was of two stages,
    the basement being one, had timber floors, and was, no doubt, like the
    middle gatehouse of the Tower of London, boarded in the rear. The two
    exterior angles are hollow, or nooked, though without shafts. The upper
    floor was lighted by three narrow, round-headed loops.</p>

  <p>Whatever may have been, in Norman times, the extent of the offices, at
    present these buildings cover three sides of the court, that to the
    north being open. Near the centre of the court was a well, and in the
    north wall, close to the steps of the keep, a small postern; at the
    north-east angle, partly on the two curtains, is a rectangular tower
    of great strength, about 26 feet by 30 feet, with walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span> 6 feet thick.
    Its basement seems to have been used as the great kitchen, though not
    originally constructed for that purpose. The upper floor is on the
    level of, and entered from, the north curtain; its north and east walls
    are pierced by a mural gallery, 3 feet broad, with two loops to the
    north and three to the east. There is also on that side a door opening
    on the main curtain. From this floor a well-stair, near the north-west
    corner, ascends to the battlements. The base of this tower seems
    Norman, but the upper floor and battlements are early Perpendicular.</p>

  <p>Of the domestic buildings there is built against the keep and the
    west curtain the smaller hall, 18 feet broad by 30 feet long, one end
    abutting on the keep, the other on a retiring-room common to it with
    the great hall. It is of two floors, the lower on the ground level,
    having a handsome door and windows. The hall, with a timber floor and
    roof, occupies the upper floor. The fireplace is in the middle of the
    west side, let into the Roman curtain, which has been raised. In the
    east side are four windows looking into the ward, each of two lights
    divided by a transom, with cinquefoil heads.</p>

  <p>Set against the keep, and also abutting on this hall, is a building
    of two floors, the uppermost of which seems to have been a chapel,
    superseding that of the keep with which it communicated. It has an east
    window flanked by two diagonal buttresses. Opposite to this, against
    the curtain, is the great hall. This is 67 feet long by 28 feet broad,
    also of two floors, the basement having been probably a cellar. In
    its north wall are arches as for a buttery, and some remains of the
    original Norman walling, probably of an earlier hall. In the north side
    are four windows, three to the west and one to the east of the great
    door, in front of which is a handsome Perpendicular porch with vaulted
    roof, and steps leading up to the hall. From the porch a well-stair and
    short gallery led to the music-gallery at the east end of the hall,
    and at this end also, in the south wall, is the great fireplace. If
    this was the da√Øs end, the gallery must have been above it,‚Äînot a usual
    arrangement. The hall had a wooden floor and a low-pitched roof. The
    porch seems later than the hall. East of the hall are other smaller
    rooms, abutting against the wall which flanks the entrance-gate. Beyond
    this gateway the remainder of the south wall, and the whole of the
    east wall to the kitchen tower, are occupied by buildings of Tudor
    date,‚Äîmere shells, probably servants‚Äô lodgings, butteries, and rooms
    connected with the kitchen department. It is said there were buildings
    against the north curtain, but of such there is now no trace.</p>

  <p>How the ramparts of the west, south, and east walls of this ward were
    reached is uncertain. There is no way to them from the keep or from the
    kitchen tower. The north curtain is reached by a short stair from the
    forebuilding. This curtain is here 10 feet thick, and has a rampart
    walk 6 feet high, with a high parapet and rere-wall. One of the old
    Roman bastions occurs on this part of the curtain. It is solid below,
    and has been raised to contain a small chamber, the floor of which is a
    little below the rampart level, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span> which a door opens into it. There
    is also a good west window of two lights, cinquefoiled, opening on the
    rampart walk, and a small fireplace; altogether far too comfortable a
    post for any officer on duty. East of this bastion the hollow angle
    between it and the curtain is crossed by an oblique arch or squinch,
    of two rings of <i lang="la">voussoirs</i> of excellent Decorated work, which
    supports a small garderobe, such as is seen on Southampton walls and at
    Ludlow.</p>

  <p>There remains to be described the gatehouse, or entrance to this
    inner ward,‚Äîa very curious structure, of unusual length, and of three
    periods. First, approaching from the outside are two parallel walls,
    5 feet thick and 9 feet apart, from within the ends of which hung the
    drawbridge, apparently without any special arch or gateway. In one
    wall is a squint loop, commanding the approach from the great gateway
    of the outer ward. From the drawbridge a passage, at first of 9 feet,
    and then of 10 feet in width, and 15 feet long, ends in a portcullis
    and gateway, the whole 2 feet deep and 9 feet of opening. Beyond this
    the passage continues 10 feet broad for 17 feet. So far, the road was
    either open or roofed with timber, and all is of Perpendicular date.</p>

  <p>Next follows a remarkably fine archway of the Decorated period, deeply
    moulded and portcullised, with a rebate for a door. This leads into
    a sort of peristyle, 8 feet deep, vaulted and groined, with ribs
    and bosses, and ending in a second and rather lower portal. In this
    peristyle are two lateral doorways, of 3 feet broad, opening upon
    the scarp of the ditch between it and the curtain wall, just as at
    Hawarden, only there they open from a chamber on the counterscarp.
    The arch in which the peristyle ends is rebated for a door, but has
    no portcullis grooves. The Decorated work here ends, the portal being
    seen to mask the original Norman entrance. This is a perfect, plain,
    square-jambed Norman entrance archway, placed in the front and centre
    of the original gatehouse, which was a plain rectangular tower of 23
    feet projection from the curtain, and 28 feet broad. Entering, the way
    lies between two lofty walls, 19 feet apart, and which for 22 feet are
    those of the old Norman gatehouse, with two lateral loops raking the
    curtain. There was a timber floor above this passage. The walls are
    then continued 28 feet further, on the left being the rooms attached
    to the great hall, on the right those of Tudor date. Thus the entrance
    to this ward is about 100 feet long, defended by a drawbridge, a
    portcullis, and two sets of gates.</p>

  <p>The two gatehouses of the outer ward next require attention. The
    water-gate is, in substance, Roman. The gatehouse is 26 feet square,
    with walls 6 feet thick, having no projection outside the curtain. All
    is perfectly plain, without buttress, chamfered edge, or moulding.
    The way lies through two doorways, opposite each other, of 8 feet 6
    inches opening. The inner arch is built of white limestone, with a few
    blocks of blood-red iron sandstone. The <i lang="la">voussoirs</i> are heavy,
    and a single ring. The walls generally are of coursed flint rubble,
    very open jointed. In the Decorated period a sort of porch, of 20 feet
    projection by 12 feet in breadth, was added upon the outer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span> face, in
    the centre of which is an outer gateway, portcullised, and flanked by a
    pair of buttresses, placed diagonally. Over the gate is a small window,
    and in the side walls two loops raking the curtain. The old Roman
    doorway in the line of the curtain has also been altered and refaced
    in the Decorated period, and a rebate added for a door. The roof was
    of timber, and there was an upper floor, no doubt an addition. This
    was reached by a well-stair in the south-west angle, rebuilt for the
    purpose, and entered by an interior door.</p>

  <p>A study of the water-gate will throw much light upon what has been done
    at the land-gate, which was evidently built originally upon the same
    pattern. Here the Roman work was either pulled down and rebuilt of the
    same dimensions, or, which seems more probable, the Roman core has been
    preserved, and a Norman facing applied. The inner gate is perfectly
    plain, save that the arch springs from a simple Norman <em>abacus</em>,
    which is continued outside the wall as a string. The outer gateway has
    not even the <em>abacus</em>; but it is masked outside by a handsome
    Decorated portal, with a drop arch and good moulded jambs, and an
    exterior drip. There is no portcullis, and no middle gate. The space
    between the gates, a square of 14 feet, was vaulted over from four
    heavy corbels in the angles, from each of which sprang five ribs,
    two placed against the walls. There was a plain but hollow chamfer,
    and they met in a central open circle, and four half circles against
    the four walls, connected by four ridge-ribs. The whole is of late
    Decorated or early Perpendicular character.</p>

  <p>Here, also, an upper floor has been added, and remains pretty perfect.
    The chamber is barrel-vaulted, the axis being east and west, and
    strengthened by seven plain chamfered ribs, of which the springings
    remain; but the bodies of the ribs, with the vault, are gone. The
    vault seems to have been pointed, and looks Perpendicular. This room
    had windows over the gateways. It was reached by a straight staircase,
    placed in a projection parallel to the north wall, on the north side,
    and vaulted over. The stair-head opened on the left into the upper
    chamber, and on the right upon the curtain. There is another door on
    the south side of the chamber opening on the opposite curtain. This
    gatehouse has a perfect and very handsome parapet, with merlons and
    embrasures of equal size, and a bold moulding is carried round each.</p>

  <p>A few yards north of this gatehouse a small lancet doorway has been
    opened in the Roman curtain, probably as a postern. At present it is a
    mere rough hole; but it looks old, and had it been very modern it would
    have been lined with brick.</p>

  <p>The structural history of the castle is tolerably plainly written
    upon its walls. Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, probably before 1133, seems to have built
    the keep, and inclosed the inner ward, repaired the Roman curtain,
    rebuilt or restored the gatehouse, and placed a hall and other domestic
    buildings along the south side of the inner ward. It may be that Henry
    himself raised the keep before the works were completed, or this may
    have been done by Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, as late as 1160.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span></p>

  <p>In the Winchester volume of the ‚ÄúJournal of the Arch√¶ological
    Institute‚Äù is a paper by Mr. Hartshorne upon Porchester, which gives
    some curious particulars as to its government and repairs. From these
    it appears that in 1220 the roof of the keep was out of order, as the
    constable has four <i lang="it">carratas</i> of lead for its covering. This
    shows that the roof then upon it was the flat one indicated by the
    weather moulding. Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, who obtained in his second, third, and
    fourteenth years upwards of ¬£10 for tallages from the town or manor
    of Porchester, suffered the castle to fall into decay, and the return
    of a survey ordered by Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> in 1274 states that the buildings
    within the castle are old, out of repair, and unfit for habitation. A
    second report was made twenty years later, after a visit from Edward in
    person, and repairs were at once ordered, which were very extensive,
    and were continued through much of the reign of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> Mr.
    Hartshorne gives an analysis of an account of the clerk of the works
    here in 1321.</p>

  <p>After the receipts, which in this year were ¬£55. 0<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 0¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, the
    particulars of the expenditure are given in detail. First, the
    cost of the materials, then the wages of the people employed, the
    foundation-diggers or ‚Äú<span lang="la">fundatores</span>,‚Äù the masons or ‚Äú<span lang="la">cementarii</span>,‚Äù at
    4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> a day; their labourers or ‚Äú<span lang="la">servientes</span>‚Äù; the collectors of stones,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">colligentes lapidum</span>,‚Äù most of which were picked up on the beach, at
    6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> a day; throwers of sand, ‚Äú<span lang="la">jactantes zabulonis</span>,‚Äù at 2<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; carpenters,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">carpentarii</span>‚Äù; sawyers, ‚Äú<span lang="la">sarratores</span>,‚Äù at 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; fallers, ‚Äú<span lang="la">prostratores</span>‚Äù;
    bark peelers or ‚Äú<span lang="la">scapulatores</span>,‚Äù at 3¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; tilers, ‚Äú<span lang="la">latamores</span>‚Äù; plumbers,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">plumbatores</span>‚Äù; smiths, ‚Äú<span lang="la">fabri</span>‚Äù; labourers, ‚Äú<span lang="la">laboratores</span>,‚Äù <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr> A new
    lock and key for the east gate cost 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> William Giles, the tyler,
    had 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> a day, and Robert, his boy, 3<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, while covering the chamber
    of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> Two large hawsers, for lifting timber and stone to the
    top of the tower, cost 43<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>; thirty-two weldichboarde boards
    were purchased at Havante for 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> each. Thomas le Piper supplied 157
    stones at 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>, and their carriage from the Isle of Wight cost 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
    They were employed for the foundation of the bridge under the castle:
    probably that in front of the west gate. Peter de Pulford, as clerk and
    overlooker, had 12<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> a day. These works would be all in the Decorated
    style, varying in detail as the style advanced. The work at the top of
    the keep was probably the present parapet.</p>

  <p>About 12 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> the repairs were resumed. The Queen‚Äôs and
    Knighton‚Äôs chambers were repaired. A ‚Äúfausse wall‚Äù was ordered to be
    built, and a barbican with a <i lang="la">br√©tasche</i> and barriers: works
    evidently of timber, and probably in advance of the west gate.</p>

  <p>Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> resumed the works, and about 1396‚Äì7, just as the Decorated
    style was passing into the Perpendicular, seems to have pushed them
    forward with great activity. Mr. Hartshorne points out that the castle
    was supplied with stone from Bonchurch and South-Wick, with freestone
    from Bereston for doors, windows, and fireplaces; and with flint-stone
    and ‚Äúrag-platen-stone‚Äù from Binnerbeg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span> also in the island. Besides
    these were wainscot boards, Botineholt boards, for doors and windows,
    hearth tiles or ‚Äúhurthtighel,‚Äù Flemish tiles from Billingsgate, and
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">reretighel</span>‚Äù or fire-bricks, for the backs of fireplaces. This accounts
    for the early Perpendicular work found all over the castle. Probably
    that in the Tudor style was executed in the reign of Elizabeth,
    who seems to have given her name to the kitchen tower, probably in
    consequence of alterations made in it.</p>

  <p>The works in modern brick were executed during the present and past
    centuries, when the Crown held the castle on lease, and fitted it up
    as a prison; building barracks, now removed, in the great court. As
    early as 1761 there were Spanish and French prisoners of war here; in
    that year, it is said, 4,000. The Dutch prisoners taken at Camperdown
    were stowed here, and many French taken in war. It is said that at
    one time as many as 8,000 were lodged here. The castle has long been
    the property of the Thistlethwayte family. A couple of hundred pounds
    judiciously laid out on the keep would close its breaches, restore the
    old doorways and stairs, and replace the floors at their proper level.
    Some such moderate outlay would also do much to improve the inner ward.</p>

  <p>The history of Porchester is but scanty. Until comparatively modern
    times it was always in the hands of the Crown, and commanded by
    constables, whose names occur from time to time in the public records.
    King John, the most restless of monarchs, was here eighteen times
    between 1200 and 1214, in all for fifty-two days. Much mention is made
    of wine stored here; at one time there were thirty tuns. In 1205 the
    king sent an engineer and sixteen miners to stay here for twenty days,
    and the constable was to find twenty picked men to aid them. Also
    Stephen English, an artificer, was sent. This might be to dig the well
    in the inner ward; the keep well must have been dug when or before the
    keep was founded. Sheep are sent for the garrison, sixty at a time,
    and petraria and mangonels, and other military stores. The tenants who
    held by castle guard were warned. To the castle was attached a large
    demesne, and a forest, under the charge of the constable, the income
    from which was considerable.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> seems to have been here two or three times, and Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>
    more frequently, staying here for several days in 1324‚Äì5‚Äì6. Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>
    mustered his army here before his French wars, and kept up a strong
    garrison and good supplies of wheat and barley, and wine.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="RICHARDS_CASTLE_HEREFORDSHIRE">RICHARD‚ÄôS CASTLE, HEREFORDSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE site of Richard‚Äôs Castle, a well-known and very ancient fortress
    in the county of Hereford, but near to Ludlow and the borders of
    Shropshire, is distinguished by one of those remarkable works in earth
    which have hitherto, in topographical books, passed undescribed, or
    described only in such general terms as afford no aid to any sound
    inference as to the people or the period by whom or at which they
    were thrown up. And yet, if there were correct plans and precise
    descriptions of the earthworks of this country, it is probable that
    some sound general conclusions as to their origin would be arrived at.
    Many, probably most, are no doubt pre-historic, but still something
    of their history may, it is probable, be established by a careful
    consideration of the evidence which they themselves afford.</p>

  <p>Richard‚Äôs Castle is one of a series of works common on the Welsh border
    and the Middle Marshes. Such were Hereford and Worcester, in modern
    times despoiled of their mounds: Shrewsbury, still towering above the
    deep and rapid Severn: Tre-Faldwin or Montgomery, a single instance
    of a town and county bearing the name of the invader: Kilpeck and
    Ewias-Harold, already described: Builth, the extreme limit westward
    held for any time by the English: Cardiff, Caerleon, Wigmore, and
    Richard‚Äôs Castle.</p>

  <p>Richard‚Äôs Castle, fortress and parish, takes name from a certain
    Richard Fitz-Scrob, one of the Normans attached to the court of the
    Confessor, and who was quartered by that prince upon probably the most
    exposed district upon the Welsh frontier; a position commanding some of
    the richest and most regretted of the lands conquered by the English,
    and sure to be assailed frequently and in force.</p>

  <p>What invader originally threw up the magnificent earthwork which must
    have guided Fitz-Scrob in his choice of a residence, is not known, but
    from its summit is comprehended one of the noblest and most extensive
    prospects to be found even in a quarter of England very rich in
    pleasing combinations of wood and water, lofty hills and broad and
    fertile dales. As the new settler traversed the meads of the Severn,
    and left behind him the grassy meadows of the Team and the Lugg, and
    rode up the rising ground to the point where his own or his son‚Äôs
    devotion afterwards established a church, he must have blessed the fate
    that placed him amidst a country so rich, and in the possession of
    which the vast earthwork immediately before him would be an assurance
    of more than ordinary security.</p>

  <p>The advent of Fitz-Scrob must have been viewed with profound dislike
    from opposite quarters. In those days, on the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span> eve of the coming
    in of William, Gruffydd, the Welsh Prince, well knew how formidable a
    neighbour was a Norman knight; and the English, who were aware what
    engines of local tyranny were the Norman castles, could not but have
    regarded with dismay the lofty walls and towers, which made impregnable
    a place already strong, and converted a well-known burh into a castle
    such as they had heard of with dread but had not before seen.</p>

  <p>What were the precise works constructed by Richard it is difficult to
    say. That he converted the mound into his keep, and girt the annexed
    ward with a wall is possible, though the masonry, of which vast
    fragments still remain, is apparently of rather a later date. There
    is no reason to suppose that he built a rectangular keep. There was
    already a mound. His keep would be on its summit, and, if masonry were
    employed in its construction, it must have been a shell or low tower at
    most of 30 feet or 35 feet diameter, such as is seen on the mound of
    Cardiff.</p>

  <p>The first danger to the new lord came from Earl Godwin and his sons,
    who represented the English, and therefore the anti-Norman feeling.
    One of the avowed grievances for the redress of which they met in arms
    at Beverston, in 1052, was the presence of Richard Fitz-Scrob upon
    English soil. That they failed, and that their failure led to the
    temporary exile of Earl Godwin is a matter of history. Richard remained
    unmolested, and, doubtless, employed himself in adding to his castle
    that strength which it could scarcely have in excess. It is not stated
    that he shared in the campaign and ignominious defeat of Earl Ralf the
    Timid against Prince Gruffydd, but probably he did so.</p>

  <p>In 1056, Harold, then Earl of the West Saxons, entered the Marches
    against the Welsh, and advanced into Archerfield, where his probable
    godson, Harold, the son of Ralph, held the Castle of Ewias-Harold, the
    earthworks of which were constructed on the type of those of Richard‚Äôs
    Castle, and which, a few years later, was to receive additions in
    masonry after the same pattern. Whether Richard was in alliance with
    Earl Harold or Harold of Ewias is not known, but the position of his
    castle would scarcely allow him to be neuter.</p>

  <p>In 1062, Gruffydd was again over the Herefordshire border, and Harold,
    then holding the Earldom of Hereford, was again at his post, and the
    Lord of Ewias joined him. This was followed by the larger expedition,
    in which Harold invaded Wales by sea from Bristol, conjointly with his
    brother Tostig from Northumberland. They met at Rhuddlan, and soon
    after the Welsh Prince was massacred by his own people. During these
    turbulent years the whole border must have been in constant turmoil,
    and we may fairly suppose that Richard, to whom both parties were in
    substance opposed, must have fortified his castle by every means then
    in use.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the Conqueror relieved Richard from his most formidable
    foe, the English people directed by an English leader. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>He and his
    son Osbert shared in the ascendancy of their race, and received from
    William large grants in Herefordshire and elsewhere which are duly
    recorded in Domesday.</p>

  <p>The castle of Richard‚Äôs Castle occupies a position equally remarkable
    for beauty and for strength. It stands upon the eastern slope of the
    Vinnall Hill, an elevated ridge which extends hither from Ludlow, and a
    little to the west of the castle is cleft by two deep parallel gorges,
    beyond which the high ground reappears in two diverging ridges, of
    which one extends westward in the direction of Wigmore and the other
    more southerly to the river Lugg, at Mortimer‚Äôs Cross, having on its
    ridge the ancient British earthwork of Croft Ambrey, and below it the
    fortress of Croft Castle, reported to occupy an early English site.
    By this means, Richard‚Äôs Castle is protected from the Welsh side by
    a double defence of hill and valley, besides its more immediate and
    special works.</p>

  <p>The castle, though far below the summit of the Vinnall, stands upon
    very high ground, sloping rapidly towards the east. An exceedingly deep
    and wide gorge descending from the west bounds the position on the
    south, while a smaller and tributary valley, descending from the north,
    falls into the greater valley below the castle, and thus completes its
    strength upon the north, west, and south points. The defence towards
    the east is wholly artificial.</p>

  <p>Upon the point of the high land, above the meeting of the two valleys,
    a large and lofty mound has been piled up, the base of which is about
    300 feet above the valley, and the summit 60 feet higher, that being
    its proper height. It is about 30 feet in diameter at the top, and the
    sides are very steep. It seems wholly artificial, and stands in its own
    very deep ditch, beyond which is a high bank. On the west side, this
    ditch is succeeded by the steep natural slope descending to the river,
    but towards the east the ditch seems to have been reinforced by a
    second, which encloses a larger area, more or less semilunar in shape,
    and which has a bank within and upon the scarp of the outer ditch,
    which is here artificial, and cuts off the fortress from the adjacent
    high ground now occupied as the churchyard.</p>

  <p>These were the defences of the original fortress, and, as was almost
    invariably the case when the Normans converted such an earthwork into
    a castle, a round tower or shell was constructed upon the summit of
    the mound, constituting the keep. From this, on the north-east and
    south-west sides, a strong and lofty curtain wall descended the slope,
    and on reaching the edge of the ditch was bent eastward, and curved
    round so as to include the whole intrenched area south-east of the
    mound, and half the mound itself, of which the other or western half,
    strong in its great natural strength, augmented by its ditch, was
    left without any exterior or second line of defence in masonry. The
    domestic buildings stood in this base court or lower ward, the keep
    only being occupied during a siege, or under exceptional circumstances.
    The entrance was by an arch in the curtain on the south side. Thus,
    as at Shrewsbury, Berkhamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>stead, and Tamworth, and indeed very
    generally, the mound and keep stood on the general <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>
    of the fortress, forming a part of its outer defence. The lower ward
    was accessible to wheeled carriages, but the keep could only be
    ascended by steps. At this time the summit of the mound is covered
    with <i lang="la">d√©bris</i> and rubbish, upon which young timber trees and
    underwood have made vigorous growth, and the enclosure, naturally
    inaccessible, is strictly preserved. The curtain descending the slope
    on the north-east is tolerably perfect, as is the adjacent part along
    the north-west front of the lower ward. Farther on, the wall seems
    to have been lifted with gunpowder, and a vast fragment lies in the
    ditch. Beyond this the foundations here and there appear; the wall
    itself remains skirting the scarp of the ditch along the east and
    south fronts, and towards the latter side is the place where the arch
    of entrance pierced the wall, as shown by the gap in the masonry and
    the passage through the bank. Just beyond this the curtain ascends
    the mound and abutted on the keep tower, completing the circle of the
    defences in masonry.</p>

  <p>From the density and offensive character of the vegetation it is
    difficult to get a good general view of the place or to follow its
    details, but the fragments of masonry lie about generally, and, if
    cleared of nettles and the thin upper soil removed, no doubt a correct
    plan of this most interesting place could be obtained, and the date
    of the masonry ascertained with some degree of certainty. The masonry
    above ground is probably Norman, but all the ashlar has disappeared.
    The great interest of the place is due to its very remarkable
    earthworks, and to the fact that it was occupied and fortified by a
    Norman master before the Conquest.</p>

  <p>The adjacent church is a large and rather fine building in the
    Decorated style. It stands but a very few yards outside the castle
    ditch, up to which its burial-ground extends. It is remarkable in
    having a large square belfry tower, detached, and placed a few yards
    south-east of the chancel.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="ROCHESTER_CASTLE">ROCHESTER CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ROCHESTER‚ÄîFortress, Cathedral, and City‚Äîis a very remarkable place‚Äîin
    some respects the most remarkable place in the South of England.
    In each of its triple capacities it claims a high antiquity. Its
    ecclesiastical history commences with Augustin and √Üthelbyrht, the
    founders of its see, over which Justus, the friend of Augustin, was the
    first to preside, and to the endowments of which a long succession of
    Kentish and Mercian princes contributed. Its secular history, though
    often obscure, ascends to a yet more remote period, and its material
    evidences are still to be read in the form of works either in earth or
    masonry, showing Roman, Saxon, Danish, and Norman occupations.</p>

  <p>Rochester is built upon a low cape or promontory formed by a grand bend
    of the Medway, the central part of which is occupied by the city, and
    the most prominent and northern point by the castle. The great Roman
    way from Canterbury to London traversed the length of the cape, and
    crossed the river near its apex, in the line of the ancient and nearly
    of the present bridge.</p>

  <p>The position of the fortress is very noble. Rising from a base of hard
    ground high above the stream, it forms a grand feature upon the shore
    of the Medway, here 1,000 feet in breadth, and which almost vies with
    the Thames in the volume of its waters. From the turrets of the keep is
    seen outspread a view of great extent and exceeding variety, including
    the steep and verdant slopes of the chalk, and the broad and fertile
    meads across which the great river flows in graceful folds, concealed
    and betrayed by the inequalities of the hills and the scattered masses
    of forest trees. The cathedral, indeed, is scarcely worthy of these
    advantages. Far from asserting, as at Durham, Canterbury, or York,
    its equality with, or even superiority over, its temporal neighbour,
    the cathedral of Rochester, venerable as it is, and honoured as are
    the ashes that lie within its precincts, is of small dimensions, and
    in position low. The castle, on the other hand, is a masterpiece of
    Norman skill, and the first and last object that strikes the eye of the
    visitor.</p>

  <p>The castle of Rochester occupies the northern termination of a chalk
    ridge which forms the right bank of the Medway for many miles above
    the city, and intervenes between the river and the cathedral, upon the
    margin of the one and but a short distance from the other. It thus
    covers about half of the western front of the city, and extends into
    what was the south-western angle of its walled enclosure.</p>

  <p>Though of ancient date, the castle proper, that is the structure in
    masonry, has evidently been preceded by the works in earth, in close
    connection with a part of which it has been laid out. These are on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
    a large scale, and, though much degraded by time and obscured by
    buildings and enclosures, are still tolerably apparent. They seem to
    have been composed of an oblong space included within a ditch, which
    commenced near the bridge foot, and was carried eastwards for about 130
    yards, when it turned to the south, and ran for about 270 yards roughly
    parallel to the river, towards which it was again returned. This oblong
    area was subdivided into two unequal parts, the southern being the
    smaller, by a cross ditch, and the latter part was occupied by a large
    flat-topped conical mound, known as Boley Hill. The northern part
    contains the castle. Along the east or cathedral side, this ditch is in
    part a bold natural depression. Along the west side it is superseded by
    the river, here very broad, deep, and rapid. The area thus included is
    about 7¬º acres. The mound is of large size, though reduced by modern
    operations. It is in part natural, in part formed from the adjacent
    ditches. Like the mounds at York, Wallingford, and Wareham, and those
    formerly existing at Hereford, Buckingham, Worcester, Hertford,
    Nottingham, and Stamford, it is so placed as to watch the river, which
    must always have been an open and dangerous highway.</p>

  <p>These lines of earthwork, though the principal and most evident now
    to be traced, are by no means the earliest among the defences of
    Rochester. Though the discovered Roman remains are not indicative of
    a large town, the Watling Street here crossed the Medway, and there
    was certainly a fortified post on the site of the medi√¶val city.
    Its rectangular form, about one-third longer than its breadth, the
    cruciform arrangement of its main streets, its four gates opposite
    to each other, and the termination of its name, all point to a Roman
    origin, and the Roman defences are thought to have been composed of a
    wall and ditch, represented by the line of the later wall, only that
    they are supposed to have passed from the south gate towards the river,
    about 45 yards west of the site of present keep.</p>

  <p>The area measured about 470 yards by 160 yards, and therefore covered
    about 15¬Ω acres, and of the gates Childegate stood to the north,
    and to the south was a gate removed only in 1770, the road between
    them passing close to the west end of the cathedral. Roman coins and
    sepulchres have been found in the castle area, and that Rochester was
    the Roman Durobrivis seems generally admitted.</p>

  <p>The Roman lines were in part adopted by the later inhabitants, and
    fortified in the English manner. The position of the new city laid it
    open to frequent and severe attacks by both land and water, and its
    works suffered much from the inroads of the Danes, especially towards
    the close of the ninth century, and to that people, though perhaps on
    insufficient grounds, has been attributed the mound.</p>

  <p>The earthwork fell into the hands of the Normans at the Conquest, and
    it became necessary to fortify the position according to the improved
    manner. The usual custom with the Normans, when dealing with an English
    stronghold, was to erect a shell keep upon the mound, or, where there
    was no mound, a rectangular tower, and to surround it with a strong
    curtain wall built upon the bank within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span> the scarp of the existing
    ditch. Probably, in this case, the older area would have required
    too large a garrison for its defence, and the mound was at a rather
    inconvenient distance from the bridge or its preceding ferry. The
    mound, therefore, was excluded from the new <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, as it was
    at first from the area of the city. Probably it was occupied as an
    outwork, or it may have been reduced to a rather lower level. The new
    curtain was built on the scarp of the ditch of the northern division of
    the earthwork on the three landward sides. On the fourth it was placed
    upon the crest of a low cliff, about 40 feet above the river, and
    rather less above the quay, which has been widened in modern times, and
    in part added to the shore.</p>

  <p>The Norman <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, the general substance of which is probably
    of the eleventh century, is roughly four-sided, about 130 yards east
    and west by 160 north and south, and includes about 4¬º acres. The
    eastern front is opposite to, and about 60 yards from, the cathedral.
    The south front faces the old mound of Boley Hill, and the north front,
    of rather greater length and set obliquely, points towards the bridge.
    It is probable that the ditch outside the south wall represents that
    of the Roman work. The gatehouse stood at the north-east angle, and
    the steep causeway leading up to it, and which has superseded the
    drawbridge, is known as the ‚ÄúVennell.‚Äù The gatehouse is gone. At the
    north-west angle are the remains of a bastion tower, standing in 1735,
    and containing a postern. In it was a shaft for lifting stores from the
    river, an arrangement seen in another form above the Wye at Chepstow.
    This tower commanded the bridge. The south-east angle is still
    capped by a bold drum tower, of 30 feet diameter and three-quarters
    projection. It has a ground and upper floor, each pierced by an arcade
    with loops in narrow lancet recesses. The floor was of timber. The
    gorge is broken down, but may have been always open. This tower does
    not rise above the curtain, and seems to be an insertion in the early
    English period. Upon the east wall are two rectangular towers, one of
    35 feet breadth and 25 feet length, wholly of exterior projection, and
    the other 30 feet by 25 feet, and partly within the wall. These seem
    insertions of the Perpendicular period. The curtain is much broken
    down, and part altogether removed; 40 feet of it remain next the
    south-east angle, on the south front. This portion is 7 feet thick,
    30 feet high, and seems decided Norman. On its outer face are traces
    of two flat pilasters. It is pierced by three loops with splayed
    round-headed recesses, 3 feet broad and 8 feet from the ground, inside.
    There must, therefore, have been a platform against the wall. From the
    same angle, along the east face, the curtain is tolerably perfect all
    along. Near the rectangular tower it is seen to be built upon arches,
    intended to be covered up, as in the walls of York and of Southampton
    Castle. The top of one arch is seen inside the wall, and the whole of
    two arches outside. A long piece of the north wall remains, and is a
    good example of early masonry, probably Norman. It is very thick, and
    built of layers of rough undressed stone laid in very thick beds of
    mortar. As at Cardiff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span> there is no foundation, the wall being laid
    on the surface of the ground, as was not uncommon with very, thick
    walls. About 260 feet of the river front remains. At its south end was
    formerly to be seen some herring-bone work, and in other parts of it is
    shown a tendency to this mode of building. It is about 40 feet high.
    Upon its inner face are seen the outlines of two pointed arches, as
    though two vaults had abutted on the wall, only the arch stones do not
    project for toothing. There was an upper floor, and in the wall, but
    outside, are seen the outlines of two rather large round-headed arches.
    It is in this wall that Roman masonry has been suspected. Much of it
    seems late Norman. There was a cross wall, now removed, which ran close
    north of the keep‚Äîand divided the Norman castle into a north and south
    ward.</p>

  <p>How the castle was connected with the defences of the city does not
    appear. The city wall is said to have been built about 1225, on the
    Roman site, as far as the south gate, from which it seems to have left
    the Roman line, and to have included the subsequent earthwork of Boley
    Hill. When this was done the old ditch was widened in some places to 85
    feet and made deeper. Part of this wall is said to stand upon arches,
    like that of the castle; if so, there was probably an earlier wall, of
    Norman date. The city wall is so blocked in, that little is visible to
    an ordinary visitor. There is thought to be a trace of Roman masonry in
    the east wall, and there is a small door of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>‚Äôs time, near the
    east end of the cathedral, where the wall is 4 feet thick and 30 feet
    high, and a tower of that date at the north-east angle, said originally
    to have been upon the town wall. This tower is a very fine work, 30
    feet diameter, outside a cylinder and within an octagon, with three
    loops, and a door in the gorge, from which pass two mural galleries,
    one leading to a well-stair and the other to a garderobe. The upper
    floor is at the level of the top of the curtain. The line of the south
    side of the city wall was altered by the monks in 1290, by permission
    from the king. They were to rebuild it 5 perches and 5 feet to the
    south or outside of the old line, and it was to be 16 feet high and
    embattled. Moreover, the old ditch was to be filled up to the length
    of 54 perches 14¬Ω feet, and in width 5 perches and 5 feet. As this
    involved prolonging the east wall, they turned an arch over the old
    ditch. This expansion of the old area lay to the east of the south gate
    of the city, a little east of which was the gate of the priory. The old
    wall is thought to have included Boley Hill.</p>

  <p>The Keep, for which Rochester Castle is justly celebrated, is placed
    within, and very near to the south-east angle of the castle area, and
    upon the highest ground within it, about 60 feet above the river: a
    point probably specially selected because it is opposed to Boley Hill.
    It does not, like Porchester, form a part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, but,
    like Carlisle, stands just within it, being from 16 feet to 33 feet
    from the eastern, and from 10 feet to 15 feet from the southern wall.
    Though not one of the largest, Rochester is one of the loftiest Norman
    Keeps in England, and one of the most worthy of note for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span> its history,
    position, the boldness of its decorations, and its substantially
    perfect condition. Of additions, with the exception of the early
    rebuilding of its south-east angle, it shows no trace, and its
    dilapidations are not greater than may be attributed to seven centuries
    of age, of which the three latter have been periods of neglect.</p>

  <p>The keep is a square of 70 feet at its base, and the walls are 12
    feet thick, reduced at the summit to 10 feet, so that its exterior
    dimensions are there 66 feet. This reduction is made by a very slight
    exterior batter, not perceptible to the eye. There is no set-off or
    string-course, outside, and no regular shelf for the floors inside.
    This uncommon thickness is intended to allow, as at Dover and
    Hedingham, of an unusual number of mural chambers and galleries. The
    height is 113 feet from the ground to the coping of the parapet, and
    the turrets rise 12 feet higher. The two western angles are flanked
    by broad flat pilasters, with hollow angles or nooks of 8 inches.
    They rise from a common plinth, and each is carried up clear of the
    parapet to form the outer face of a square turret, the height of which
    adds much to the commanding aspect of the building. The north-east
    angle is capped in a similar way, save that the pilasters are rather
    bolder, have no plinth, and the angles are solid until clear of the
    forebuilding. The south-east angle has neither plinth nor pilaster,
    but is capped by a rounded projection, which, though early, is not
    original. This also terminates in a turret, which is rounded towards
    the field, but flat on its two inner faces. On each face of the keep,
    near its centre, is a single pilaster of moderate width and projection.
    These also rise from the plinth and ascend to the parapet, two of
    them actually to its coping. On the north face is a second narrower
    pilaster, formed by continuing the wall of the forebuilding upward.</p>

  <p>The keep has many openings, mostly of small size. A tier of
    round-headed loops marks the basement, and of square-headed ones, a
    trifle larger, the first floor. Next a line of small round-headed
    windows shows the level of the second or main floor, and one of larger
    windows the gallery of the same. Above all, a line of rather larger
    windows, also round-headed, indicates the uppermost floor. The two
    upper lines were ornamented, and had Norman half-piers and mouldings,
    and in some of the openings the windows were coupled, but the ashlar
    dressing has been much broken away. There are besides several loops
    placed near the angles, indicating garderobes, mural chambers, and
    staircases, and each turret has a window on each of its outer faces.</p>

  <p>Internally, the keep is divided into two nearly equal chambers by a
    cross wall, east and west, 5 feet 6 inches thick throughout, and rising
    to the roof, where it carried the main gutter. Thus each floor was
    composed of a north and south chamber, one 21 feet and one 20 feet
    broad, and each 46 feet long. In the cross wall, near its centre,
    thickened by a pilaster strip on each face, is the well, said to be
    60 feet deep from the ground level, and to contain usually 10 feet
    of water. It has an ashlar pipe, 2 feet 9 inches diameter, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
    seems to have been carried up to the roof, and was accessible by four
    small round-headed doors, one on each floor. It is unusual to see the
    well-pipe carried higher than the first floor: at Dover it reaches the
    second. To the north face of the Keep is appended the forebuilding
    covering the main entrance, which, as usual, was at the first-floor
    level.</p>

  <p>The basement is reached only by a well-stair in the north-east angle,
    which stair, as in the Tower of London, ascends from the base to the
    summit. This staircase is 11 feet diameter, and contains 133 steps.
    It communicates with each floor, with several galleries and mural
    chambers, with the chapel, and with the roof of the forebuilding. The
    basement is at the average level of the ground outside, and there is no
    underground chamber.</p>

  <p>The north chamber is entered at the north-east angle by the well-stair
    from above, and aired rather than lighted by three round-headed loops
    placed in its east, west, and north sides. These are of 4 inch opening,
    set in splayed recesses, and these again in flat-sided recesses, 6 feet
    broad and 3 feet deep, all round-headed, and the larger descending to
    the floor. The north loop, which opened into the bridge-pit of the
    main entrance, has been converted into a rude doorway, but the head
    of the loop remains. In this wall are two narrow doors, of which one
    descends 8 feet by nine steps into the basement of the forebuilding,
    and the other ascends by a slight slope into the first floor of the
    same. Besides these, near the west end of this wall, is a recess, 6
    feet wide and 6 feet 9 inches deep. This recess, the depth of which
    seriously weakens the wall, can here produce no bad effect, the wall
    having been supported outside by the solid steps and lower gate of
    the forebuilding. In the west wall, besides the loop, is a broken
    doorway opening into a mural chamber, 4 feet 6 inches by 10 feet, which
    occupies the north-west angle of the building. In the cross wall,
    besides the opening to the well, are two doorways of 4 feet 7 inches
    and 5 feet opening.</p>

  <p>The south chamber has single loops to the east and west, and two in the
    south wall in recesses, all of the pattern already described. There is
    also a mural chamber 3 feet 10 inches by 10 feet, in the south-west
    angle, entered by a door in the south wall, and near the east end of
    the same wall is a recess, 6 feet broad and 3 feet deep, but without a
    loop. The masonry shows this angle to have been rebuilt. Besides these
    cavities there are two, one in the west wall, 2 feet 10 inches by 3
    feet 7 inches, entered by a rugged opening, 2 feet 7 inches broad,
    and the other in the south wall, 2 feet 10 inches by 4 feet 3 inches,
    with an opening much broken away. These cavities are shafts, which
    ascend vertically in the wall, and above are divided, showing that they
    are the vents of the garderobes in the first and second floors. The
    openings into them are not original, and probably the shafts were sunk
    a few feet below the floor, and ended either in cesspools or a drain.
    As there are other garderobes in the upper floors, there are, no doubt,
    other shafts, not broken into. There must be at least two, one at each
    end of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>cross wall in the north chamber. It is curious that these
    vents, which in Norman buildings often open, as at Ludlow, upon the
    outer face of the wall, should have vertical shafts, while the turrets
    of the fire-flues vent in the face of the wall. At Coningsborough the
    arrangement is the reverse; the flues are vertical, the garderobe vents
    horizontal. The basement was evidently a store-room. It was about 15
    feet high, and from it 20 steps led to the first floor.</p>

  <p>The first floor, also of two chambers, was lofty, gloomy, and perfectly
    plain. It was probably the soldiers‚Äô lodging during a siege.</p>

  <p>The North Chamber. In the north wall, near the east end, is the main
    entrance, 15 feet from the ground, and opening from the vestibule of
    the forebuilding. This is a bold, full-centred arch, of 6 feet 2 inches
    opening, with flat sides, in a wall here 10 feet 6 inches thick. The
    outer face is flanked by nook shafts, and the architrave has a bold
    chevron moulding. The inner architrave has a similar but rather plainer
    moulding, but the jambs are broken away. Just within the outer face
    is a square portcullis groove, and behind it a rebate for a door,
    expanding the passage to 7 feet. Near the inner face, in each side, is
    a small round-headed recess, 2 feet 6 inches broad by 1 foot 4 inches
    deep, probably to hold the keys or a lamp. The door was secured by a
    stout bar, and the grate, which seems to have been of iron, was worked
    from a mural passage above. This portal led direct into the north
    chamber, about 7 feet from the well-stair door. In the north-west angle
    is a mural chamber, called ‚ÄúGundulph‚Äôs room,‚Äù vaulted and groined, 10
    feet 3 inches by 11 feet 7 inches, entered by a door in the west wall,
    and lighted by two loops to the west. In its rounded north-west corner
    is a fireplace with a small Norman hood of 2 feet 6 inches projection,
    having a segmental arch. The tunnel is conical, and ends in a couple
    of openings in the hollow angle of the south end of the adjacent
    pilaster, in the face of the wall, above 12 feet above the hearth. Near
    the north-east angle of this chamber is a small blocked-up doorway,
    which, as at Middleham, opened upon the roof of the outer gate of the
    forebuilding. The ashlar rings of the loop recesses, and the hood of
    the fireplace, are of excellent workmanship. Besides these openings
    there are in the north chamber four windows, one at each end, and two
    in the north side. These are set each in a recess, 5 feet 6 inches
    opening, and 9 feet 6 inches deep, 15 feet high, and round-headed, the
    loops being square-headed, about 1 foot 6 inches high by 12 inches
    broad. These recesses, from their great height, produce a good effect,
    but were probably found to weaken the wall, for they have been partly
    built up and reduced at their lower 6 feet to a depth of 3 feet. The
    blocking is of inferior masonry, executed in haste. Between the two
    northern loops is a fireplace of 5 feet 6 inches opening, round-headed,
    having no hood, and with a round back. It is strengthened by a pilaster
    of 9 inches projection and 10 feet breadth, from the inner wall. The
    tunnel from the fireplace is conical, and has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span> lateral vent about 15
    feet up. In the east wall, near the entrance from the well-stair, is a
    recess, which, besides the loop, contains a postern and a garderobe.
    The latter is a mural chamber, 5 feet 10 inches by 13 feet, which opens
    from the southern jamb of the recess: the postern, 2 feet 6 inches
    broad, is cut obliquely through the wall, and opens in the face of the
    keep, 15 feet above the ground, and about 30 feet from the rampart of
    the curtain, with which it must have communicated by a light plank
    bridge. There is such a door in the Norman keep at Adare, and in the
    later Wakefield tower in London, to which a stone bridge has recently
    been fitted. In the cross wall, besides the well opening, are two doors
    corresponding to those below.</p>

  <p>The south chamber has a loop at each end, and three in the south wall,
    all in recesses similar to those in the north chamber, and these also
    have been partially blocked up to strengthen the wall. There is a
    fireplace in the south wall corresponding to that described above,
    and in the south-west angle a door leads into a well-stair, 11 feet
    diameter, which commences at this level, and communicates with the
    floors above, and with the battlements. There are four mural recesses
    in this chamber. One, a garderobe, opens in the south jamb of the
    recess of the west window, and another in the east jamb of the central
    window in the south wall. The shafts from these recesses descend into
    the wall of the lower chamber, as described. The other galleries open
    right and left from the window recess in the east end. That to the
    north is a passage, 3 feet 6 inches by 8 feet, with a garderobe in
    the end of it. That to the south is a gallery, 20 feet long by 3 feet
    broad, which ends in the south-east angle, where it has two windows
    to the south and east. This is in the rebuilt angle. This floor
    rested upon timber joists. From it forty steps lead up the north-east
    staircase 30 feet to the main floor, and at thirty-six steps branched
    off a narrow stair to the chancel of the chapel.</p>

  <p>The main, state, or second floor, 32 feet high, rested on each side
    upon eighteen joists, whole timbers. It contains two tiers of windows,
    the lower opening directly from the chamber, the upper with the
    intervention of a mural gallery. Between the two is a plain string of
    Norman pattern. The roof was flat, being the joists and planks of the
    upper floor. The window recesses of the lower tier range from 3 feet
    2 inches to 5 feet 10 inches opening, and those of the gallery tier
    nearly correspond to them. All are flanked with nook shafts, but the
    lower architraves have a bold roll and hollow moulding, those above
    have the chevron pattern. The ashlar of the windows is mostly gone. The
    lower seem to have been plain and small, the upper richer and rather
    larger, but none at all large. The projections in front of the well,
    the fireplaces, and the two staircases, are beaded at the angles. There
    are no marks of corbels for struts to stiffen the joists and give
    support to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>The north chamber was entered by a sort of lobby, 5 feet 6 inches
    square, and groined, into which the staircase opened. The recesses
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>of the east and west windows each have mural garderobes opening
    from the southern jambs. The two recesses in the north wall have no
    side openings. Between them is the fireplace, similar to that below,
    but with a handsome chevron architrave. Over the great entrance is a
    doorway of 7 feet opening, leading to the chapel. In it is the chase
    for working the grate, and beyond this is a rebate reducing the passage
    to 3 feet to form the chapel door. In the north-west angle is a small
    chamber.</p>

  <p>The south chamber has three windows in the south wall, a fireplace, and
    a door opening into the south-west well-stair. In each end is a loop.
    In the recess of that to the west, on its north side, is a passage to a
    garderobe, and there is probably a corresponding place in the opposite,
    or east window, but the window recesses are inaccessible.</p>

  <p>The cross wall, instead of two doors, is pierced by four arches of
    unequal size, two on each side of the well pier, which has its small
    and rather ornate door. Between each pair of arches is a heavy Norman
    pier, a plain cylinder with fluted capital, and opposite to which are
    two half-piers, or responds. The arch has been ribbed and worked in
    bold roll and hollow, varied with the chevron pattern, but the central
    rib has fallen away. The capitals of this arcade range with the general
    string-course, and the arches rise into the upper division of the
    apartment. There is rather more ornament on the north than on the south
    face. The arcade was filled up with a stone screen, about 10 feet high,
    of which one division remains and a part of its doorway. The screen is
    original, and has been rather richly worked, but it had no bond into
    the piers, being merely built against them.</p>

  <p>From this floor twenty steps led up 17 feet to the gallery. This
    threads the whole wall, passing all round the building. It is from 3
    feet to 3 feet 6 inches broad, barrel-vaulted, from 8 feet to 9 feet
    high, and is placed 4 feet from the inner face of the wall, and 5
    feet from the outer. It is generally level, save that it rises at the
    south-west angle to accommodate itself to the staircase, and in the
    centre of the east front to clear the vaults of the garderobes below,
    and possibly to meet the thrust of the arch in the cross wall.</p>

  <p>In the north division there are in the west end three recesses, 3 feet
    7 inches, 5 feet 10 inches, and 4 feet 1 inch, which open into the
    gallery, and correspond to three windows in its outer side. In the
    north wall are also three windows with recesses corresponding, each
    of 5 feet 10 inches in width. In the east end is only one recess of 5
    feet 9 inches opening. At this point the gallery is rather above 3 feet
    wide, and the corresponding window has a recess, 5 feet by 4 feet. Most
    of these expansions of the gallery opposite to the windows are groined,
    as in the corresponding gallery in the Tower of London.</p>

  <p>The arrangements of the south division are very similar. In the east
    end is one recess of 5 feet, and in the west three of 3 feet 2 inches,
    5 feet, and 3 feet 7 inches, the central being the largest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span> That
    at the south end represents a short window, intended to conceal the
    gallery, which here rises to the staircase. In the south wall are
    three recesses, with windows corresponding. There is no chamber in the
    south-east angle, the gallery merely turns at a right angle, but in the
    north-west turret is a groined chamber, 6 feet square, with which the
    gallery communicates, and which has windows in its two outer faces. The
    north-east and south-west angles are occupied by the staircases. It
    is evident from the character of the masonry that with the south-east
    angle have been rebuilt the two adjacent windows in the south face and
    of that in the east face. The new work is inferior to the older, and
    there is no attempt at ornament. The arrangements of this grand floor,
    like those of the corresponding rooms called the Council Chamber in
    the Tower of London, must have been inconvenient in the extreme. The
    rooms must have been very cold and very public, with windows, doors,
    and garderobes on every side, and a gallery in which a whole household
    might have listened, unseen, to what went on below. There is nothing
    to distinguish between the uses to which these two noble chambers were
    applied. Probably the northern, having the more ornate entrance, was
    the hall, and the southern a room of a more private character.</p>

  <p>From the gallery level twenty-three steps lead up 17 feet to the upper
    floor, and on the way a small passage opens upon the battlements of
    the forebuilding. This floor contains two very cheerful and handsome
    rooms, 25 feet high, with larger windows than the floors below, and
    a finer view. Here, also, the window recesses and fireplaces are
    ornamented, and we may suppose this floor to contain the private
    apartments. The roofs were open and low pitched, and seem to have been
    supported by rafters placed near together, and without principals. The
    arrangement of the mural galleries here is peculiar. They do not run
    round the rooms, but are short, connecting two, or at most three window
    recesses. Where the wall has been rebuilt they are altogether omitted.
    They do not pass behind the fireplaces, the vents from which pass off
    horizontally, and so block the way.</p>

  <p>The north chamber is entered, like the rest, from the north-east angle,
    and from the staircase passes a gallery which pierces the east wall for
    20 feet, and traverses the recesses of two windows which light the east
    end of the room. In the west end are also two windows, in like manner
    pierced by a short gallery, entered only from the chamber. In the north
    wall, besides the fireplace, are four windows, two on each side of it,
    each pair connected by a short gallery, also entered from the chamber.
    In the cross wall are two doorways, and near the centre the small door
    of the well pipe.</p>

  <p>The arrangements of the south chamber are somewhat different. In the
    west end are three window recesses, having a mural gallery in common,
    but not communicating with the staircase. In the east end is but
    one window, the jambs of which are solid. In the south wall is the
    door from the south-eastern staircase and also three windows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span> with
    a fireplace. There are no galleries in this wall. This chamber has
    suffered much from the destruction of the south-east angle, which it is
    evident carried with it about 28 feet of the south and 15 feet of the
    east wall. In the untouched part of the east wall remains embedded the
    half pier, capital, and half the architrave of a large original late
    Norman arch, of about two-thirds the span of the room, more or less
    ornamented, and evidently the recess for a large east window. It is
    just possible, as this was an archiepiscopal fortress, that this was
    a chapel. In the south wall, close east of the fireplace, is the jamb
    and half the arch of a window recess, also ornate, of which the other
    part has been removed. The restoration has been effected in a very
    hasty and slovenly manner. The masonry is of inferior quality, and the
    new recesses are perfectly plain, although the older ones in the same
    floor are rather highly ornate. Whatever, in designing this chamber,
    may have been the intention of the builder, it is very certain that the
    re-builder thought only of making the tower defensible in the cheapest
    and quickest way.</p>

  <p>From this floor thirty steps ascend 25 feet to the battlements. On the
    way a passage from the north-eastern staircase opens into a gallery
    in the east wall, 16 feet long and 5 feet wide. It is traversed by
    a window, the recess of which, 4 feet wide, opens on the gable of
    the north room of the upper floor. The staircase passes up to the
    base of the north-east turret, in which are two doorways opening on
    the ramparts of the north and east walls. The rampart walk is 4 feet
    broad, with a parapet of 2 feet and a rere-wall, now gone, of 3 feet.
    The walk is carried through the north-west turret, which contains a
    chamber 9 feet square, and through the south-eastern turret, which
    also contains a chamber. From hence the passage is continued along
    the south wall, but is stopped by the wall of the south-west turret,
    the stair contained in which only opens on the west wall. The turret
    chambers were about 8 feet high and had flat roofs, reached possibly
    by wooden steps. Each turret had two entrances, one on each face. The
    parapets of the curtains between the turrets were 8 feet high, and
    contained five embrasures on each face. At this level the profile of
    the double roof may be traced. It was composed of two ridges, one
    over each chamber, with a central gutter resting upon the cross wall.
    Both parts were low pitched, and the ridges did not rise above the
    battlements: the northern portion sprung a little the lowest and had
    rather the steeper pitch. The southern, springing higher, delivered
    half its water from eaves 2 feet above the common gutter, whence it was
    carried away by an enormous stone shoot, a sort of gurgoyle. Another
    such, taking the contents of the north gutter, crosses the head of the
    staircase and projects eastward. At the rampart level the walls and
    turrets are pierced by a row of holes 9 inches or 10 inches square,
    intended, evidently, for the horizontal beams of a brattice. There are
    no corbels or cavities, as usual, below, to receive struts, the beams
    being probably strong enough without them. These holes seem not to
    be original, and being rough, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span> probably made in haste when the
    south-east angle was rebuilt: they are of importance enough to be shown
    in the tower which figures in the corporation seal. Besides these, in
    the inner face of the north wall, above the gutter, are two rows of
    pigeon-holes, probably original, and even now accommodating a few birds.</p>

  <p>Affixed to the north front is the forebuilding, composed of a
    gatehouse, staircase, drawbridge, and vestibule tower. These formed and
    protected the entrance to the keep. The approach is thought to have
    commenced on the west front, near the north-west angle, by a flight of
    steps, which turned the angle, as at Dover, and were continued as a
    broad staircase against the wall of the building. Upon this, flush with
    the west front, was a small low tower, about 12 feet square, through
    which the stairs passed. This portal had a barred door, but no grate,
    and its roof was reached from Gundulf‚Äôs chamber in the first floor of
    the keep. From this gate the steps rose to the bridge pit, a cavity 15
    feet deep by 9 feet opening. This was crossed by a drawbridge, which
    fell from the gate of the vestibule tower. The stairs were 8 feet
    broad, and protected by an outer parapet 2 feet thick and 6 feet high,
    and probably looped. The parapet crossed the bridge pit on an arch, so
    that persons ascending the stairs or crossing the bridge were protected.</p>

  <p>The vestibule tower is 19 feet broad by 36 feet long, and two-thirds
    of the height of the main building, against the north face of which,
    at the east end, it is built. Its walls are 6 feet thick; they have no
    plinth or pilaster steps, and though probably of the age of the keep
    the work is of an inferior character. There is a basement, first floor,
    vestibule floor, and chapel. Each floor is entered from the keep. The
    basement is 14 feet by 23 feet, vaulted and groined, and it has two
    air-holes near the vault, ascending obliquely through the wall. The
    floor is on the ground level, here low, and from it a passage, 2 feet 7
    inches wide and 12 feet long, leads up nine stairs into the basement of
    the keep. The present door from the exterior is evidently not original.
    This chamber was a prison.</p>

  <p>The first floor measures 13 feet by 23 feet; it also has two air-holes,
    rather larger and less oblique than those below. A recess, perhaps
    a doorway, perhaps a cupboard, has been opened in the east wall and
    fitted with a Tudor door-case. This chamber had a flat timber ceiling,
    forming the floor of the vestibule. It was entered by a passage, 2 feet
    10 inches broad, slightly ascending to it from the basement of the
    keep. This also was probably a prison, but of a less severe character.</p>

  <p>The second or vestibule floor is of the same dimensions. In its west
    wall is the outer door of the keep, of 6 feet opening, round-headed,
    and flanked inside and out with engaged columns, with plain caps, and
    round the arch a band of chevron moulding. In the rubble work inside,
    above its head, is seen a pointed arch of relief. The portal was closed
    by a barred door only. On the right, on entering the vestibule, is the
    door of the keep. The vestibule has five windows: a small one in the
    west wall commands the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span> staircase; in the north wall are three windows,
    each formed of a pair, coupled; in the east wall is one. They are all
    round-headed, with Norman ornaments: one-third of the east end of this
    chamber is covered with a barrel vault.</p>

  <p>The third or upper floor of the forebuilding is occupied by the Chapel,
    the dimensions of which correspond nearly to the rooms below. It is
    divided into two parts, a nave and chancel, separated by a plain,
    bold, round-headed arch of 12 feet span. The nave is entered from the
    main floor of the keep by a side door, close to which, in the wall,
    is a recess, now inaccessible. The chancel has a stone floor, resting
    on the vault below, and its roof is three sides of an octagon, also
    vaulted, a sort of apse, but covering a rectangular space. There are
    two east windows, and a large stone drain, which has led to the notion
    that this room was the kitchen, and no doubt it would have made a very
    good one. The nave had an open roof of low pitch, which was replaced
    by one perfectly flat, but at the level of the original ridge. If the
    large upper room in the keep was a chapel, a second would scarcely be
    necessary. Probably both were not in use at the same time. A kitchen
    is a very uncommon adjunct to a Norman keep, as the inmates seem to
    have broiled their meat at an open fire, whereas a chapel is not
    uncommon; and at Middleham, Dover, Newcastle, and probably at Corfe and
    Kenilworth, it was in the forebuilding.</p>

  <p>The material of the keep is chiefly the rag-stone of the country,
    with ashlar coigns and dressings of Caen stone. The ashlar is rather
    sparingly used, but is of sound quality and close jointed. The rubble
    is poor, imperfectly coursed, and held together by the excellence of
    the mortar, or rather of the lime, for the mortar is carelessly mixed
    and is full of sea shells, which have been brought with the sand and
    left uncrushed. It is clear from appearances, both inside and outside
    the building, that the south-east angle has, at some period soon
    after its construction, fallen down, and been rebuilt soon afterwards
    clumsily and in haste. No mere battering by a ram, no strokes from the
    missiles of a catapult, however ponderous, would have brought down both
    turret and wall. Such ruin must have been produced by a mine, and this
    is the more probable since the south-east is the most exposed angle
    for such an attack, the scarp of the ditch being here steep, the soil
    soft chalk rock, and the keep but a few feet from the ditch. A mine
    opened in the scarp, just outside the angle of the curtain, and driven
    40 feet in the chalk, would reach the foundations of the turret, and
    thus undermined, its fall would bring down more or less of the adjacent
    walls, and falling outwards, would crush the angle of the curtain. This
    would account for the large mass of the angle which has fallen, and for
    the circular bastion tower, evidently an insertion, at the angle of
    the curtain. Supposing the keep, built in 1126, to have been mined and
    breached in the memorable siege of 1215, and the damage soon after made
    good, this would account for present appearances. It is true that the
    bastion tower is decidedly early English, while the restoration of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
    keep is Norman, but it is of a period when round and pointed arches
    were both in use, and when the character of the older part of the keep
    would naturally lead to the employment of the former; so that the
    restoration might have been effected as late as 1225, ten years after
    its probable destruction, and when an entry in the Pipe rolls shows
    that the sheriff of Kent repaired the tower.</p>

  <p>There is a good deal in the character of the forebuilding that looks
    as though it was an addition to the keep; and yet this cannot be,
    seeing that the difference in its masonry includes that of the adjacent
    staircase turret, which could scarcely be an addition. Also the remains
    of the lower gatehouse, on the north face of the keep, are clearly as
    old as the keep, of which they are part.</p>

  <p>It was long the custom to attribute this keep to Gundulph, making it
    contemporaneous, or nearly so, with the Tower of London, which it
    resembles in some of its arrangements, especially its mural gallery and
    fireplace. Attention to its other details shows, however, that this
    cannot be so, and that its more probable builder was Archbishop Walter
    Corboil, about 1126. Those who desire to see examples of Gundulph‚Äôs
    work, and to compare his masonry with that of Rochester keep, should
    examine <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard‚Äôs Tower at Malling, some parts of the nave and
    transept of Malling Abbey Church, and the north tower of Rochester
    Cathedral. The White Tower in London has been so often repaired and
    refaced that it is difficult to be sure of its original masonry. Part
    of the curtain of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of Rochester Castle may also be
    Gundulph‚Äôs work. The north wall looks very early, as does the east
    wall, which is of excellent though rudely coursed rubble, the stones
    being large and the joints broad, though there are no layers of flat
    stones as at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard‚Äôs.</p>

  <p>Rochester much resembles Hedingham, a very pure and very perfect
    Norman keep, with three floors, the remains of a forebuilding, and the
    upper gallery in the main floor. In each ornamentation is effectively
    employed, and great use made of the chevron moulding. The two buildings
    are, probably, of about the same date.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>The history of the castle of Rochester, in the proper sense, begins
    with the Norman Conquest, but there is something to be said of the
    preceding earthwork, subsequent to the Roman period. The bishopric, of
    which the city is the metropolis, was founded in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 600,
    and Justus, its first bishop, was consecrated in 604. The church,
    dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew, was founded by √Üthelbyrht, King of Kent, and
    his charter of 604 mentions certain land as extending from the west
    gate and the wall of the city, one boundary being ‚Äúfram Suthgaete west,
    and langes wealles.‚Äù Also, other land granted is said to be, ‚Äú<span lang="la">extra
    murum civitatis versus aquilonem</span>.‚Äù In 673 a synod was held here, says
    Bede, attended by Putta, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Episcopus castelli Cantuariorum quod dicitur
    Hrofesc√¶stir</span>;‚Äù so that it was then a strong place, and the bishop‚Äôs
    residence, and this whether ‚Äú<span lang="la">castellum</span>‚Äù relates to the city, or, which
    is at least equally probable, to the adjacent fortress.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span></p>

  <p>In 765, Ecgberht, King of Kent, granted by charter to Eardulf of
    Rochester, his faithful minister and bishop, ‚Äú<span lang="la">terram intra castelli
    m≈ìnia supranominati, id est Hrofiscestri</span>;‚Äù and in 781, √Üthelberht, King
    of the West Saxons, says, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Concedo Hrofensis ecclesi√¶ ... aliquantulum
    terr√¶ juris mei intra m≈ìnia supradict√¶ civitatis in parte aquiloni</span>‚Äù;
    and in 788, Offa, King of the Mercians, granted ‚Äú<span lang="la">terram ... sex
    aratrorum</span>‚Äù at Trotescliff, ‚Äú<span lang="la">ad ecclesiam beati Andr√¶ apostoli et ad
    episcopium castelli quod nominatur Hrofescester</span>.‚Äù Also, in 789, King
    Offa, in another charter to the same Bishop Weremund, mentions the wall
    (murus) of the city, and says, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Ecclesia qu√¶ sita est in castro quod
    nominatur Hrofesceaster</span>.‚Äù Further, in 850, √Üthelwulf, King of the West
    Saxons, mentions ‚Äú<span lang="la">murum civitatis Hroffi</span>;‚Äù and in 855 he granted land
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Dunne ministro meo ... in meridie castelli Hroffi</span>.‚Äù</p>

  <p>In 839 and in 885, the city was attacked by the Danes. On the former
    occasion they took and sacked it, on the latter it was relieved by
    Alfred. In 986, the city was attacked, but unsuccessfully, by √Üthelred,
    and in 998 with more success by the Danes, who came up the Medway.
    Boley Hill is said to have been thrown up by the Danes in 884, but the
    greater part of the hill is natural, though, no doubt, with a very
    considerable addition; but even the addition would have required more
    time than was allowed them by Alfred, and a work of such a character
    would be far more useful for defence than for attack. The towers used
    in an attack were generally of timber, and so constructed as to admit
    of being pushed up to the walls. It is more probable that the mount was
    thrown up as a strong residence for the bishop, to give such personal
    security as was found necessary at Sherborne.</p>

  <p>It is not known in whose hands the fortress of Rochester rested in the
    times preceding the Conquest, but Earl Godwin had certainly encroached
    upon the episcopal property; and what more probable than that he should
    have laid his hands upon a place which, with Dover, would give him the
    command of the great road from the South to London? We read in Domesday
    of the episcopal manor of Estockes or Stoke. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Hoc manerium fuit et est
    de Episcopatu Rofensi, sed Godwinus comes T. R. E. emit illud de duobus
    hominibus qui eum tenebant de Episcopo et eo ignorante facta est h√¶c
    venditio.</span>‚Äù So when the term of the tenancy expired the bishop would
    find that instead of two nameless men ready to give up possession,
    he would have to deal with a powerful noble claiming the freehold.
    Stoke passed with Godwin‚Äôs Earldom of Kent at the Conquest to Bishop
    Odo of Bayeux, and was recovered by the archbishop, as Domesday goes
    on to relate, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Postmodum vero regnante W. Rege diratiocinavit illud
    Lanfrancus Archiepiscopus contra Baiocensem Episcopum et inde est modo
    saisita Rofensis Ecclesia.</span>‚Äù</p>

  <p>It is probable that in some such way Odo received the city with the
    earldom, and with it the fortress, which the Bishop of Rochester,
    however, may have recovered possession of in the way shown, and which
    he certainly afterwards exchanged with the king for land in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span> Aylesford.
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Episcopus etiam de Rouecestria pro excambio terr√¶ in qua castellum
    sedet tantum de hac terra tenet quod xvii solidos et iiij denarios
    valet.</span>‚Äù There never was a castle at Aylesford. The bishop gave up the
    site of Rochester Castle, receiving for it as much land as was worth
    17<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

  <p>Gundulf, the follower and friend of Lanfranc, and consecrated Bishop of
    Rochester in 1077, was a great architect, and a very remarkable man,
    well deserving the panegyric bestowed upon him upon his promotion,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">Eratque Gundulfus religione plenus, literarum non nescius, in rebus
    forensibus acerrime elimatus et qui putatus sit divina potissimum
    electione hunc honorem meruisse.</span>‚Äù As to his architectural skill, and
    his work at Rochester Castle, it is said, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Gundulfus, quia in opere
    c≈ìmentarii plurimum sciens et efficax erat, castrum sibi, Hrofense
    lapideum de suo construxit.... Igitur, hoc pacto coram rege inito,
    fecit castrum Gundulfus Episcopus de suo ex integro totum costamine,
    ut reor, LX librarum.</span>‚Äù This transaction between the bishop and the
    king occurred about 1076. The king was to restore to the see the manor
    of Hedenham, in Bucks, and the bishop to employ his skill and spend
    ¬£60 in building a castle, that is, a tower of some sort. What Gundulf
    certainly built is the tower which still bears his name, and which
    seems originally to have been upon the city wall. On the death of
    William the castle was a very strong place, and was seized upon and
    held by Odo for Duke Robert. Odo (Judas Iscariot, as he was called by
    the friends of Rufus), associated himself with Eustace of Boulogne and
    Roger de Belesme, and garrisoned the castle, storing there the spoil
    drawn from the adjacent country. Rufus, whose activity was a strong
    contrast to the indolence of his brother, attacked Rochester, while
    Odo retired to Pevensey to await succour from Normandy, which never
    came. Rufus took Tunbridge and Pevensey, and forced Odo to demand the
    surrender of Rochester by his allies. The garrison understood the
    sincerity of the demand, sallied out, captured their royal escort and
    their bishop, and installed him, nothing loth, in the government of
    the castle. Rufus converted the siege into a blockade of both castle
    and city, and finally, under the pressure of a pestilence, both were
    surrendered, and Odo was finally banished. Gundulf died in 1108. This
    first siege of Rochester is one of the great military events of a very
    stirring period, and one deserving far more notice than has hitherto
    been bestowed upon it.</p>

  <p>The castle, thus taken in 1088, seems to have remained in the
    Crown for thirty-eight years, when, in 1126, Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> granted ‚Äúto
    Archbishop William de Corboil and his successors the perpetual charge
    and constableship of the castle of Rochester,‚Äù thus leaving it in
    the Church, but detaching it finally from the see of Rochester. The
    archbishop, we are told, built, in consequence, a handsome tower,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">egregiam turrim</span>,‚Äù which is, no doubt, the existing keep. William died
    in 1139, between which date and 1126 the keep was, therefore, built.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, also alludes to the castle in his confirmation charter to
    the church of Rochester, ‚Äú<span lang="la">volo etiam et ipsi et homines sui sint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
    liberi et absoluti ab omni opere castelli, et expeditione archisve
    constructione;</span>‚Äù so that, probably, the arx, or citadel, was then in
    contemplation or in progress. It may be that Gundulph‚Äôs Tower was
    removed to make way for the new keep, but in this case its materials
    would have been made use of, and some trace of them would be almost
    certain to be detected. But there is no such trace, so that, probably,
    the new keep did not supersede the older tower.</p>

  <p>The castle, especially with its splendid and very strong keep, was
    far too important a military post to remain unchallenged in the
    possession of the see of Canterbury, and both when the see was vacant
    and at other times the Crown got possession, and its repairs were then
    entered on the Pipe roll. In 1141, William of Ypres, a Fleming, was
    its governor for Stephen, and when the Earl of Gloucester was taken he
    was confined here for a short time‚Äîfrom September to November,‚Äîuntil
    he was exchanged for Stephen. Various sums were spent upon the castle
    between 1167 and 1202, when it was again given up to the archbishop,
    then Stephen Langton. Towards the close of John‚Äôs reign the castle
    was placed by Langton in the hands of William d‚ÄôAlbini, to be held in
    the interest of the barons, whose army proposed to march from London
    to its relief. John, however, interposed, and in 1215, after a severe
    siege of three months, it was surrendered. Wendover expressly states
    that the military engines employed on this occasion produced but little
    effect, but that the place was taken by the efforts of the miners, who
    first undermined and threw down the walls, and then applied the same
    method of attack against the tower. It was, without doubt, on this
    occasion that the south-east angle was destroyed. In May, 1216, it was
    taken, apparently without any difficulty, by the Dauphin, but on John‚Äôs
    death it fell, with other Crown possessions, into the hands of Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Under Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> considerable sums were spent upon it in repairs,
    especially in 1225, when, probably the broken angle was made good. In
    1226‚Äì7 a bretasche and drawbridge were repaired, and the gutters of
    the hall in the keep. Unfortunately, here as elsewhere, the repairs
    were commonly those of buildings in the courtyard, all which are now
    destroyed. The keep was not used save for stores. In 24 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the
    tower was ordered to be whitewashed in those places which had not been
    so washed before. In 31 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, both chapels were ordered to be
    wainscotted. One of these, at the least, was pretty sure to be in the
    outer ward, for the use of the garrison.</p>

  <p>In 1264, the castle was in charge of the celebrated Roger de Leybourne,
    who had just taken part with the king. As de Montfort was supposed to
    meditate an attack on Rochester, Leybourne defended it with a strong
    garrison, and stored it with ample provisions. In April, the attack
    being expected, Warren, Earl of Surrey, Henry‚Äôs brother-in-law, came
    to the castle. The barons laid siege to it just before Easter, and
    remained before it nearly a week, but without any result, and on their
    retreat most of the garrison, with Leybourne, joined the king at Lewes,
    and took part in the battle. The loss of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span> that battle was followed by
    the surrender of the castle, but after the death of de Montfort and
    the fall of Kenilworth, Leybourne resumed his governorship. A century
    later, in 1367‚Äì8, extensive repairs were undertaken by Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,
    under Prior John of Rochester as chief clerk of the works. Stone was
    imported from Beer, Caen, and Reigate, with copings and crests for
    battlements, probably for buildings in the court. Since that period
    it has played no part in the transactions of the kingdom, nor is its
    military history of any special interest. An extant drawing, taken in
    1588, shows the turrets domed over and capped with vanes, like those of
    the White Tower.</p>

  <p>Excellent papers have been written upon Rochester Castle by Messrs.
    Beal Poste, Blaauw, Hartshorne, and Burtt, the latter in the form of an
    account of Roger de Leybourne‚Äôs share in the Barons‚Äô war.</p>

  <p>P.S. Since the above account was written, Mr. Irvine, the very able and
    acute superintendent of the late Sir Gilbert Scott‚Äôs works at Rochester
    Cathedral, has made a discovery which is not in accord with any of
    the existing opinions as to the particulars of the Roman settlement.
    It appears that the south transept is built across a ditch, which
    runs north and south, and, no doubt, underlies the whole breadth of
    the cathedral. The ditch is 12 feet broad at the top, and 7 feet at
    the bottom of the excavation, now 14 feet deep, but was probably much
    deeper. It is cut through sound old gravel, and was filled up with
    black soil, with occasional dressed stones of Roman workmanship, Roman
    tiles, and bits both of black and red pottery, one of the former having
    a stamped interior ornament. Mr. Irvine, it is said, is in a condition
    to show that this was the ditch of a wall standing to its west, or
    towards the river. If so, the original station may have occupied the
    site of the present castle, at the west end of the accepted place of
    the Roman town, of which it may have been the citadel.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="ROCKINGHAM_CASTLE_NORTHAMPTONSHIRE">ROCKINGHAM CASTLE, NORTHAMPTONSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WITHIN the north-eastern border of Northamptonshire, abutted upon by
    the shires of Leicester, Rutland, and Lincoln to the north and east,
    and by that of Huntingdon to the south, is a large tract of rather
    elevated land, known as the Forest of Rockingham. Its natural limits
    are the valleys of the Nen and the Welland, whose general parallelism
    is continued in their course across the Holland fen to their common
    termination in the Wash. Towards the west this platform is further cut
    off by the Ise, which rises about four miles from the Welland and falls
    into the Nen by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span> Wellingborough. The tract thus marked out by nature,
    and long known as the Forest, extends east and west twenty-four miles
    from Oxendon Bridge to that of Stamford, and is at its widest between
    Rockingham and Thrapston, about twelve miles. The position, when the
    meads of the Nen and the Welland were marshes, and the fens scarcely
    navigable, was one of great strength, and occupied at an early period
    by invaders and colonists of Danish blood, whose traces are largely
    preserved in the topographical nomenclature of the district. The soil,
    chiefly derived from the subjacent oolite, is not naturally fertile,
    and long remained as forest, which even now, though cultivation has
    made immense progress, is represented by large patches of woodland,
    such as the well-timbered parks of Rockingham, Boughton, Blatherwick,
    Burleigh, Drayton, and Dene; the wilds of Morehay and Sulehay; the
    Bedford purlieus; and the Chase of Geddington.</p>

  <p>Rockingham, which gave name to the forest and to a much smaller tract
    of land still known as the Shire, is placed upon the right or south
    bank of the Welland, just above the point where the influx of the Eye
    brook marks the meeting of the counties of Northampton, Leicester, and
    Rutland. The village stands on ground rising from the river, and above
    and to its south, immediately over the parish church, is the castle.
    The castle is a marked feature in the landscape, as it is placed upon
    a sort of promontory which juts out from the table land of the forest
    towards the Welland, and is protected on each side by a deep ravine,
    two of many by which the steep margin of the valley is intersected.
    South-west of the castle, and divided from it by the larger ravine, is
    the park, a very ancient enclosure, at one time containing red deer,
    which, however, had disappeared before Leland‚Äôs visit; and behind, and
    south of the castle and the park, is the tract of recently-enclosed
    land called the Shire.</p>

  <p>Rockingham has been described as a name of English formation, purely
    descriptive. The castle stands on the ‚ÄúRock;‚Äù between it and the
    Welland is the broad and fertile ‚ÄúIng,‚Äù or meadow; and the ‚ÄúHam‚Äù
    represents the village, whether enclosed by bank, ditch, or hedge.
    Other authorities, with perhaps more reason, have objected to this
    use of the word ‚Äúing,‚Äù and have supposed the name to be the ‚Äúhame‚Äù or
    home of the ‚ÄúRockings.‚Äù However this may be, ancient as is the name,
    and important as must ever have been the position, the place is not
    to be found in any record previous to the Conquest, though a similar
    name occurs in Kent as Roegringham, in a charter by C≈ìnulf of Mercia,
    <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 811. It may be that the name is found elsewhere, for
    among the followers of Archduke Philip at his meeting with Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>
    in 1500 occurs ‚Äú<span lang="fr">Le Sieur de Rockingham de Flanders</span>‚Äù (‚ÄúLetters of Henry
    <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>‚Äù, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 88). The earliest mention of the place is in Domesday, where
    it is stated that the king holds Rockingham. Bovi held it in the time
    of King Edward with sac and soc. It was waste when King William ordered
    a castle to be made. No doubt here, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span> generally elsewhere, William‚Äôs
    decision was guided by the existence of an earlier work. It is evident,
    from an inspection of the remaining earthworks, and from a comparison
    of them with others, such, for example, as Brinklow, that they belong
    to the class of moated mounds, and consequently are far older than the
    Conquest. Bovi, no doubt, dwelt here, and it was his strong dwelling
    that the Conqueror ordered to be converted into a castle.</p>

  <p>Enough remains to show that the earthworks were composed of a conical
    flat-topped mound or donjon, with a base-court attached on one side.
    The mound seems to have been about 100 feet diameter on the top, and
    not less than 30 feet high. It was circumscribed by its proper ditch,
    which, to judge from indications on the south side, must have been
    broad and deep. To the north of the mound was the base-court, of an
    irregular but rounded figure, covering about 3¬Ω acres. The outline of
    this court corresponded generally with the contour of the ground, the
    slope of which formed a part of the defence. The court abutted upon
    the north face of the mound, outside its ditch, and covered about
    one-third or five-twelfths of its circumference. Thus the greater part
    of the mound, as at Brinklow, was outside the general line of defence,
    of which it formed a part. Also it was posted on the side of the
    work opposite the high ground, between the heads of the ravines, and
    naturally, as at Brinklow, the weakest side. In advance of the mound,
    at some yards distance, is a bank and ditch crossing the approach, and
    again in advance, about a furlong from the keep, is a second ditch,
    even now containing water, and dividing the castle precinct from the
    shire. Probably these outworks are of later date than the keep. There
    are also other works to the east, beyond the ravine, and especially one
    large bank which now forms the central line of an avenue of lime-trees.
    These works are irregular, and were possibly thrown up when the castle
    has been besieged. On this side are also some small tumuli, placed two
    and two, said to cover the remains of cottages.</p>

  <p>The changes made by the Norman builders, and by those who in their
    turn destroyed the Norman walls, have much effaced the traces of the
    early fortress. The bank, which no doubt encircled the court, has been
    thrown back so as to raise and level up the interior platform, and
    for the main ditch has been substituted a scarped revetment about 8
    feet high, surmounted by a parapet, which represents the curtain wall.
    At the foot of this are the remains of the ditch, and lower down the
    hill certain terraces, which look as though they had been defended
    by lines of stockade for musketeers during the parliamentary siege.
    These irregularities of the surface have been thought to represent a
    British camp, for which the situation is, no doubt, suitable. Of the
    mound there remains only a semilunar bank, which formed its northern
    edge. The central and southern parts have been removed and thrown into
    the ditch, the line of which is indicated by a slight but clear and
    broad depression. This was evidently done when the Parliament obtained
    the place, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span> render it indefensible. It is also evident that the
    base-court was subdivided, as at Brinklow. This is shown by the levels
    of the different parts. One division ran north and south, cutting off
    on the east the entrance ward with the lodgings. The other ran east
    and west, and subdivided the western ward. The three courts are on
    different levels, the entrance court the lowest by 6 feet or 8 feet.</p>

  <p>Whether the Conqueror built a work in masonry, or merely strengthened
    the existing defences, is unknown. There is no masonry extant of that
    century. But he or his successors certainly placed a shell keep upon
    the mound, and built a wall round the court. This wall seems to have
    had six faces, and to have occupied a circuit of about 490 yards. It
    still commences at the top of the keep mound, descends the slope,
    crosses the ditch, and runs 134 yards in a straight line, forming the
    east front of the castle. The lower courses of this wall, which is 9
    feet thick, may be late Norman. The upper part, 25 feet to 30 feet
    high, is probably Decorated, as is the gatehouse, which is in this
    front. Towards the north-east angle the wall has been rebuilt, and
    supports a seventeenth-century building. At this, at a right angle,
    the wall is replaced by a revetment of late date, and runs westward
    for 83 yards, having the church, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, below and in front of it. The
    direction of the wall then changes to the south-west at the angle of
    about 160¬∞, which was capped by a round mural tower, of which the
    foundations remain. This face is 94 yards long, and ends in an angle of
    130¬∞, where, no doubt, was another drum-tower. Then follows a side of
    64 yards, ending in an angle of 140¬∞, followed by a side of 40 yards,
    then by an angle of 150¬∞, and a short side of 25 yards, which ends in
    the keep mound in a mass of masonry, which, if not wholly original, is
    so in part, and formed of old material. Thus the whole circuit of the
    court wall from one side of the keep to the other is about 440 yards.
    The two western faces rise directly over the ravine. The two to the
    south-west are some way from its edge, and here are no traces of a
    revetment; and there was, no doubt, a ditch. The wall is now removed,
    but indications of its foundation are seen on the turf in dry weather.
    The distance from one end of the wall to the other, measured across the
    keep, is 50 yards, which thus completes the circuit of the court.</p>

  <p>Between the two masses of masonry which mark the abutment of the
    two ends of the outer wall upon the keep, is a third, which points
    north-west, and shows the line of a cross wall which divides the
    entrance from the western wards. The line is followed by the later
    buildings and by the western end of the castle hall. The place of
    the cross wall branching westward from this is indicated by a double
    yew-tree hedge, and a step of about 4 feet.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse is composed of two half-round towers, 26 feet diameter,
    flanking a gateway of 10 feet opening. The towers spring from a block
    60 feet broad and 30 feet deep, having no internal projection, so that
    the towers and a part of the block stand out from the wall 47 feet,
    giving a fine, bold character to the entrance. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>towers are of
    two stages, divided outside by a string-course, and crowned above by
    a plain embattled parapet resting upon a second string. The gateway
    has a low-pointed arch, over which the string is continued and raised
    so as to form a square head. The entrance passage, 10 feet broad, is
    30 feet deep. Within the portal is a portcullis groove, rounded and
    narrow, as for an iron grate, and behind it a rebate for folding doors.
    At the other end of the passage is a second portal, also with gates.
    Each portal has had a bold internal drip, now cut flat. A plain cornice
    shows that the original roof was of timber, and flat. The present and
    new beams have by an oversight been laid lengthways. On each side
    is a small, heavily-moulded door, with an equilateral head, in very
    excellent style. The north tower contains two chambers, one 16 feet
    by 18 feet, with a loop into the courtyard, and from which a small
    Decorated doorway opens into a front half-round chamber of 12 feet
    span, having three loops to the front beneath deep arched recesses.
    In the south tower are also two chambers. That in front has two loops
    only. The other chamber has a door into a garderobe in the south wall.
    The roofs were all of timber, and the internal doorways heavy but
    excellent Decorated. The gatehouse has been much repaired. The plinth
    is new. The exterior has been chisel drafted, and the jamb mouldings of
    the portal apparently recut. The towers had till lately conical roofs,
    which, however, were not original, and the parapet, though in excellent
    taste, is modern. The loops are cruciform, with short cross-limbs, and
    ≈ìillets below. The late Rev. T. James attributes this gateway to the
    year 1200.</p>

  <p>Upon the curtain wall, a few yards south of the gatehouse, is a door,
    and near it a loop, both of Decorated date, and which evidently
    belonged to a mural tower, now replaced by a modern larder.</p>

  <p>Entering the castle by the gateway, on the left and in front are the
    lodgings, buildings of very various dates. The entrance to the house
    on the left is, however, older than any other part of the front. It
    is an original door of Decorated date, and in a good style, and opens
    into what was once the hall or an antechamber leading into it. Opposite
    is a corresponding door, of the same age, which opens into a yard or
    court set round with buildings of all ages. The hall has long been
    converted into two floors, and is traversed by two partition walls, but
    the lateral or exterior walls are original, and contain two fireplaces,
    now covered up, but indicated by broad exterior buttresses, and several
    windows, no longer in use, and but partially seen. This is the only
    part of the present house that can be certainly shown to have belonged
    to the ancient castle, and it was probably begun about 1275. The place
    of the west window is occupied by a large Tudor or Stuart insertion.</p>

  <p>The space within the ancient walls, from the doors to the west end,
    measures about 20 feet by 85 feet, too long for the proportions of a
    hall, so that it is probable that the actual hall was confined to the
    western portion of it, which contains one of the fireplaces and the
    jambs of four of the original windows.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span></p>

  <p>Between the east end of the hall and the curtain wall is a fine pile of
    building bearing date 1585, the work no doubt of Edward Watson. This
    contains the kitchen and various offices, and probably includes parts
    of the ancient building. Another building on the north-east side of the
    court, and a long line of buildings facing the west, and containing the
    end of the hall, are dated 1660. A building on the curtain wall between
    the gatehouse and the keep is dated 1669.</p>

  <p>The present cellars lie between the hall and the keep, and, though
    modern, are conjectured to occupy the place of the castle chapel, and
    near them is the well, though it is doubtful, from an old plan, whether
    there was not also a well in the keep.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the lower part of the eastern curtain wall there
    is no masonry visible that can by any possibility be of the eleventh,
    and probably none of the twelfth, century. In the churchyard are some
    fragments in the Norman style, but they are not supposed to have
    come from the castle. Over the inner portal a stone carved in a sort
    of cable moulding has been inserted, but this does not appear to be
    Norman, and in any case has only lately been placed there.</p>

  <p>The works of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> and Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> are represented by the upper part
    of the curtain, the gatehouse, and the doors, walls, and windows of the
    hall, and probably by the three blocks of masonry that abut upon the
    keep mound, though two of these may be in substance earlier. All the
    rest of the castle is the work of the several grantees, and mainly, if
    not wholly, of the ancestors of the present owner. The general result
    of the mixture of buildings of so many styles and ages is exceedingly
    happy. The rooms, though not lofty, are comfortable and picturesque,
    and filled with fittings and furniture in harmony with their age and
    dimensions, and also with modern appliances. The walls, of the stone
    of the country, have a venerable aspect, and are covered with climbing
    plants, and the platforms of the several wards, and interior of the
    keep mound, are lain out in lawns and flower-gardens, whence the view
    over the village and beyond the Welland is very extensive.</p>

  <p>Leland, who visited the castle in the reign of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, while it
    was yet a military building, has left a description of it, and what
    he then saw:‚Äî‚ÄúThe castelle of Rockingham standith on the toppe of an
    hille, right stately, and hath a mighty diche, and bullewarks agayne
    without the diche. The utter waulles of it yet stond. The kepe is
    exceeding fair and strong, and in the waulles be certein strong towers.
    The lodgings that were within the area of the castelle be discovered
    and faul to ruine. One thing in the waulles of this castelle is much to
    be noted, that is, that they be embattelid on booth the sides, so that
    if the area of the castelle were won by cumming in at either of the
    two greate gates of the castelle, yet the kepers of the waulles might
    defende the castelle. I marked that there is a stronge tower in the
    area of the castelle, and from it over the dungeon dike is a drawbridge
    to the dungeon toure.‚Äù‚Äî‚Äú<abbr title="Itinerary">Itin.</abbr>,‚Äù <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> 14.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span></p>

  <p>The mighty ditch, and bulwarks beyond it, refer probably to the keep
    and the ground to its south, where alone a ditch was needed. The
    keep was, of course, a circular or polygonal shell upon the mound.
    The strong towers on the walls were, no doubt, drums like those of
    the gatehouse, capping the angles of the curtain wall. The double
    parapet was not unusual, and with a wall 9 feet thick by no means
    impracticable. Where the strong tower stood is unknown, but it must
    have been within the court, north of the keep, and beyond the ditch
    of the keep or donjon, to which its drawbridge gave access. Of the
    second great gate no tradition is preserved, but it could not possibly
    have been anywhere save to the south, as on the other sides is no
    practicable approach. The latest works are two towers by Mr. Salvin,
    one plain, square, and solid, near the keep, the other octagonal,
    light, and lofty, placed near the end of the hall. They are a great and
    judicious addition to the building.</p>

  <p>It so happens that there exists a still later evidence for the
    condition of the keep in a plan probably representing the temporary
    works thrown up during the parliamentary attack for the defence of
    the keep from an attack on the outer or south front. This shows the
    summit of the keep covered with buildings arranged in a polygon 80 feet
    diameter, with an open court in the centre. Outside these, along the
    edge of the mount, is a line of stockade, 180 feet long, resting on the
    walls of the court, and strengthened by two bastions of timber. The
    bottom of the ditch forms a covered way, and along the counterscarp is
    placed a second line of stockades, 240 feet long, and also resting at
    each end on the walls. The ends of the curtain and of the intermediate
    wall abutting on the keep are also shown. On the south margin of the
    keep is a well. This plan is specially interesting, as it not only
    shows that there was a building upon the mound, but lays down a plan of
    defence, which in all probability is precisely what the Conqueror found
    here in use when he ordered a castle to be made.</p>

  <p>Among the Fabric rolls in the Public Record Office are several entries
    relating to Rockingham Castle, from which the following extracts were
    made by the late Mr. Burtt.</p>

  <p>A small roll, 4 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, of masons‚Äô and carpenters‚Äô work, amounting
    to ¬£37. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

  <p>6‚Äì7 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> is a roll of five membranes, closely written on the face

    and according to this roll was ¬£103. 0<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 12<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

  <p>15‚Äì16 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, also a full roll, Michaelmas to Michaelmas. Masons
    engaged ‚Äú<span lang="la">circa novum turiolum juxta coquinam</span>,‚Äù a carpenter, making
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">gistas ad turriolum de Holebrooke</span>‚Äù; a mason ‚Äú<span lang="la">cooperiens ij turiolos,

  <p>In the same record mention is made of ‚Äú<span lang="la">stagnum</span>,‚Äù or tin, for solder:
    of the gables of the solar or upper floor, next the sun. ‚ÄúCyntles or
    cindules‚Äù are shingles for roofing. ‚ÄúViz,‚Äù from ‚Äúvis,‚Äù a screw, is a
    spiral staircase. ‚Äú<span lang="la">Vertevellis</span>‚Äù are hinges, and ‚Äúgumphis,‚Äù the big
    hooks on which they turned: gudgeon and pintle.</p>

  <p>The above entries show much attention to the lodging of the King
    and Queen, and but little to those of any one else, or to the
    fortifications. The old hall is probably that which preceded the
    present structure, and was no doubt Norman. The cellar under the
    oriel is mentioned. The magna turris was probably the keep, and the
    drawbridge that which crossed the keep ditch. The barbican was no doubt
    a timber structure outside one of the two outer gates. The old chapel,
    probably that in which the council met, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span> destroyed, and a new one
    erected. The new hall seems to have been in progress 8‚Äì9 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p>The history of Rockingham is closely bound up with that of the forest,
    of which its constables or castellans were almost always seneschals.
    It has been shown that the Conqueror here ordered a castle to be made,
    and probably therefore he visited the spot. In 1095 it was selected by
    Rufus as the place of meeting for the nobles and prelates of the realm
    to discuss with Archbishop Anselm the important question, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Utrum salv√¢
    reverenti√¢ et obedienti√¢ Sedis apostolic√¶ posset Archiepiscopus fidem
    terreno Regi servare, annon</span>‚Äù? When the King arrived from Normandy,
    29th December, 1094; he found Anselm about to accept his pall from
    Urban <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, whom the king had not acknowledged as pope, and the question
    arose whether the recognition of Urban was consistent with fidelity to
    the crown. The meeting took place at Rockingham on the fifth Sunday
    in Lent, 11th March, 1095. They met in the chapel, when Anselm called
    on the prelates for their advice. The prelates inclined to the feudal
    rather than the ecclesiastical view of the question, which they rather
    avoided, and decided that Anselm had treated the king with disrespect.
    The meeting was adjourned to the Monday, when the prelates agreed that
    the assembly was one of vassals of the crown, and not a synod, and
    they and the nobles advised Anselm to submit himself to the king. On
    the Tuesday a deputation of the prelates met Anselm. They persisted in
    regarding the difference from the secular point of view only, offering
    an opinion that as a vassal of the crown the Archbishop was in the
    wrong, but declining to go further, or to pass any censure upon their
    ecclesiastical superior. The meeting then broke up, Anselm refusing
    to give way. Soon afterwards the king acknowledged Urban and received
    his legate, but without consulting or informing Anselm. All this shows
    that Rockingham was then an important place. The chapel must have been
    more than a mere oratory in the keep like those of Arundel or Lincoln,
    and there must have been some sort of accommodation for the assembly,
    composed as it was of laymen of high rank and of bishops, in an age
    when men of that order were not remarkable for asceticism.</p>

  <p>The forest is said anciently to have extended to Northampton, but
    the boundaries, as fixed by various perambulations from Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> to
    Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, limit it to Oxendon and Stamford bridges. It was divided
    into the Bailliewicks of Rockingham, Clive or Clyffe, and Brigstoke,
    each under a bailiff and verdurers, and in each of which was a forest
    lodge, kept in repair by the crown. At Geddington on the Ise was a
    larger residence, often visited by the sovereigns, where a great Curia
    Regis was once held, and where still remains one, the most perfect,
    of the memorial crosses set up by Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> to his Queen. Many manors
    also were held of the castle by the tenure of castle-guard. There is
    no regular list of these, but it is known that among them were Little
    Billing, Cottingham, Aldwinkle, Cogenhoe, Harwedon, Hanington, Horton,
    Isham, Uphall, Wotton, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span> Barony of Chipping-Warden, which
    itself had tenants holding by like services. Also an inquisition, 18th
    February, 18th Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, shows that the Manor of Wahul was held of the
    king per Baroniam by the service of one knight‚Äôs fee, and sixty-nine
    shillings each Michaelmas, for the ward of Rockingham Castle. The
    sums for which the service was commuted ranged from twenty pence to
    seventy-five shillings annually, and were assessed at five shillings
    for a knight‚Äôs fee. The collection of these sums was the business of a
    special officer who held half a virgate of land by this tenure, besides
    hous-bote and hey-bote in Cottingham wood, a right to grass his horse
    in the Abbot of Peterborough‚Äôs meadows at Eston, and his diet when
    the king or his constable were in residence. He seems to have been
    called the castle bailiff, and in Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>‚Äôs time, when Geoffrey de
    Rockingham held it, the office was hereditary. There was also a weyte
    or watchman, who mounted guard at night, and held the weyte fee by the
    tenure of castle-weyte. Simon de (la) Weyte held the office 36 Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>In 1137 we are told in the <cite>Anglo Saxon Chronicle</cite> that the Abbey
    of Peterborough, under its indomitable abbot Martin, that ‚Äúgood monk
    and good man,‚Äù recovered from William Malduit, who held the Castle
    of Rockingham, the lands of Cottingham and Easton. Malduit was only
    constable, but in the lawless reign of Stephen the keeper of so strong
    a place must have exercised very independent powers. The castle was
    never actually alienated from the crown, and was frequently visited by
    the kings, together with Brigstoke and Geddington, and forest laws were
    very strictly enforced, through the Justice ‚Äú<span lang="la">in itinere forestarum</span>.‚Äù In
    1139‚Äì40 (5 Stephen) the king had a vinedresser at Rockingham, for whose
    livery was allowed thirty shillings, and twenty shillings were spent in
    procuring necessaries for the vineyard. In 1188, 11th February, a great
    assembly, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Curia Regis</span>,‚Äù was held at Geddington to discuss the question
    of a crusade. In 1189‚Äì90 the Sheriff of Northamptonshire accounted for
    one hundred shillings for the rent of Rockingham.</p>

  <p>In 1194 King Richard was here.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> allowed ¬£4. 11<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 3<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for the castle porter and
    two watchmen. The custos or constable purchased his office. In 1157‚Äì8
    Fulk de Lisoriis accounted for twenty pounds for the old rent of the
    forests of Rockingham and Selveston, and a similar sum was accounted
    for as the new rent of the same forests. In 1199 Robert Malduit paid
    for it one hundred pounds by four quarterly payments. He had already
    held it. King John was here at least fourteen times between 1204 and
    1216, and dated many instruments from hence. In 1204, 5th May, the
    county of Rutland and the vill of Rockingham had been settled in dower
    by John on Queen Isabella. He probably retained the castle. In this
    settlement he followed precedent, for in 1209 Pope Innocent called upon
    him to restore to Berengaria, Richard‚Äôs queen, her goods, among which
    is specified ‚Äú<span lang="la">In Nordhantonscire Rokingham cum pertinenciis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span> ejus</span>‚Äù
    (Rymer). The dower was confirmed 5th May, 1215. In 1204 the Patent
    Roll shows that King John granted to Samson Wascelin, ‚Äúour clerk,‚Äù the
    church of Rockingham with the attached chapel of Manneton, in free
    alms for life. In 1205, Scogernel, a king‚Äôs messenger, had ninepence
    for going to Rockingham. In October, 1207, Earl David (of Huntingdon)
    had paid the king in his chamber at Rockingham, by the hand of Peter
    de Stoke, ¬£100 due on an imprest, and in 1208 Hugh de Nevil was to
    be prepaid his outlay, estimated by competent persons, on the king‚Äôs
    houses at Rockingham and Clyve.</p>

  <p>In 1209 and 1210 occur divers entries in the Mise Roll concerning
    William Aquarius, who provided the king‚Äôs bath. Of eight baths, he had
    made one at Northampton. There is no bath at Rockingham. There are
    payments for the ‚Äúroncini‚Äù [baggage ponies] of Thomas Marescal staying
    at Northampton and Rockingham for six days with the royal wardrobe,
    while the king wandered [‚Äòspatiatum‚Äô] among the forests and rivers. He
    thus visited Geddington and Clyve, where he lost 4<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 10<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> at tables
    with the Earl of Salisbury, and afterwards 4<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> Also the keep of
    twenty-nine horses and twenty-four valets (garciones) for three days at
    Rockingham, with a workshop (fabrica), cost 24<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 5<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

  <p>The frequency of the royal visits was in some measure due to the
    necessity for supporting the household from the local resources; wine
    however, notwithstanding the vineyard, was imported and kept in store,
    especially at Southampton, and there delivered to the king when needed.
    Thus, in 1212, sixteen casks of wine were imported, of which five went
    to Rockingham, three to Clyffe, and four to Geddington; and John while
    here, 10th July, acknowledges the receipt of a coat of mail which had
    belonged to the Constable of Chester. Here also, according to the Mise
    Roll, John ordered 100 marcs given him by the burgesses of Nottingham
    to be expended in making a tower ‚Äú<span lang="la">in mota de Notingham</span>.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The castle was also a prison. In 1213, Gilbert de Gartington was to be
    set free from thence, with his chattels, on bail; also Robert de Mara,
    taken at Carrickfergus, was freed at the request of the legate. In
    1214, the chancellor was directed to purchase five dolia of the best
    wine in London and to send them to Clyffe, Geddington, Rockingham, and
    Selveston. In this year ¬£127. 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> was allowed for works on the new
    tower and chamber in the castle, and Peter de Barr and Nicholas de
    Hugevill, foot crossbowmen, were sent to be employed in the defence of
    the castle, at six pence per day each. In January, 1215, the chancellor
    was to send more red wine. In March the king has restored to William,
    Earl of Albemarle, the manor of Rockingham, which had belonged to Alice
    his paternal aunt (amit√¶ su√¶). This may be either Alice de Romeli his
    mother‚Äôs mother, or Alice Mareschal his sister. He is to have ‚Äú<span lang="la">homines,
    res, terras, et omnes possessiones</span>.‚Äù In May, William de Harcourt is to
    be well received at the castle if he needs hospitality. It appears that
    the late custos had been enclosing, for the king gives to Roger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span> de
    Nevil the whole assart of Rockingham which Hugh de Nevil had assarted
    or cleared, and adds common of pasture in the vill for his stock, by
    the tenure of a pair of gilt spurs annually.</p>

  <p>1216, 4th March, of the prisoners sent by Lady Nichole de Haya to
    Nottingham four are to be transferred to Rockingham. The custos of the
    castle seems to have been trespassing on the powers of the sheriff,
    which the king sets right. Probably there had been a disturbance at
    Rockingham for John directs the Constable of Nottingham to liberate
    on a fine a prisoner taken there. Later in the year the garrison must
    have been discontented, for the custos is ordered at once to pay their
    arrears of livery to the men who garrison the castles of Northampton
    and Rockingham, so that they may have no excuse for desertion. The
    constable is to retain for the use of the castle the manors of
    Geddington, Cliff, Brigstock, and Corby. He is to act as escheator in
    order to give seizin of Blaston and Weston to Ralph Fitz Peter. This
    is one of the first orders made in the new reign, and is witnessed by
    the Earl marshall ‚Äú<span lang="la">teste Comite</span>.‚Äù Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> was probably at Rockingham
    many times, certainly in 1220, 1226, and 1229.</p>

  <p>1217, the Abbot of Peterborough asks not to be distrained for his
    castle guards. This is granted, but the knights who hold the abbot‚Äôs
    fees are to do the service. In 1218 Richard Trussell was fined for
    taking his dogs through the forest. In 1219 to Hugh de Nevil is
    restored the bailliage of the forest and of Clyve, Gettington, and
    Brigstoke. The offices being connected with land, the constable is to
    give seizin. 25th June the king sent his huntsman, Richard de la Hunt,
    to chase in the forest, and during his stay the sheriff is to provide
    for him and his two horses, two valets, a swordsman or ‚Äú<span lang="la">sicarius</span>‚Äù
    (bernarius), a whipper-in (veltarius), four greyhounds, and fourteen
    <i lang="la">chiens de meute</i> (canes de mota necessaria). He is also to have
    salt for salting the venison which he may take, and a carriage to
    convey it to the king as needed. Occasionally an order is given to
    allow some great man to take three or four bucks or does, but it is
    evident the number named are not to be exceeded. 19th July, Walter de
    Preston is sent to take forty bucks for the king‚Äôs larder. In November,
    William, Earl of Albemarle, in charge of the castles of Rockingham,
    Sauvey, and Biham, had refused to give them up, on which the sheriffs
    are warned that he had been excommunicated by the legate, and no person
    is to aid him in holding the castles. The earl, however, resisted, and
    this castle was actually besieged and taken by surprise 28th June,
    1220 (‚ÄúHist. Anglor.,‚Äù ii. 242). Henry was here in person, and allowed
    William de Albini three, and William de Insula two, bucks. William de
    Preston and Richard de Watervill are also allowed twenty each, probably
    for the king‚Äôs use. A little before this, in May 1220, Isabel, the
    king‚Äôs mother, wrote to inform him that on his account rather than
    her own she had married the Comte de la March, and requested that
    her husband might be allowed her dower, which included Rockingham
    Castle (‚ÄúLetters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span> Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>,‚Äù i. 115). In July the bailliages
    were returned to Hugh de Nevil, who had a charter from King John, and
    in November, Fulk de Breaut√© had one hundred pounds for his expenses
    during the siege of Rockingham, which he seems to have conducted.
    Sauvey and Rockingham when taken were found to be utterly bare of
    provisions, not three loaves of bread being found in the two.</p>

  <p>Henry seems at first to have granted his mother‚Äôs request, but 2nd
    September, 1221, Richard de Ripariis had the custody of the whole land
    which the Comte de la March had held in England of his wife‚Äôs dower,
    and the good men of Rockingham were to answer to Richard for the rent
    of the vill, as they had done to the earl and his wife.</p>

  <p>Other entries relate to the same year. The constable is allowed large
    timber for the repairs of the king‚Äôs houses and the ‚Äú<span lang="la">turris</span>‚Äù of
    Rockingham, and the sheriff is to allow twenty marcs for the same.
    Also Hugh de Nevile is to take a forest verdurer and good men ‚Äú<span lang="la">de
    vis√±eto</span>‚Äù [from the neighbourhood; hence ‚Äúvenue‚Äù as applied to a jury]
    of Cottingham and Carlton, and measure the assart which the Abbot of
    Peterborough had licence from King John to make. If 100 acres or less,
    the abbot is to be left in peace; if above that area, Hugh is to take
    possession and report.</p>

  <p>16th April, 1222, the men of Rockingham are informed that Queen
    Isabel and her husband are again allowed the dower lands. In May the
    Earl of Albemarle had made his peace, and under King John‚Äôs charter
    touching the lands of Hawise, his mother, he is acquitted of relief
    and other charges for his farm of the manors of Rockingham, Clyffe,
    and Brigstoke, from the day on which he took charge of the castle to
    the 18th November, 1219. In this month the king sent ten marcs for the
    repairs of his houses, and the same for the castle, to be applied as
    far as it would go.</p>

  <p>1223: the abbot is not to be distrained in time of peace for more than
    four shillings, castle guard, according to the tenor of the charter of
    Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> 13th September, it appears that Alianor, the king‚Äôs aunt
    (grandmother), formerly Queen of England, had the fair of Rockingham
    as part of her dower, and, she being dead, Isabel and the Comte de la
    March are to have it, with all the dues. 31st October, the custos has
    five marcs from the sheriff for the repairs of the gutter of the king‚Äôs
    chamber. 1224: in this year ten casks of wine were sent to Rockingham,
    and the carriage from Southampton to be paid by the sheriff, and later
    on ten dolia more. Walter the Miller has an oak for the repair of the
    bridge; one conveniently situated is to be chosen. In 1225 the sheriff
    was to take with him proper men, skilled in carpentry and masonry, and
    see to the repairs of the king‚Äôs chamber in the castle, and for this
    sufficient timber was to be allowed. The Bishop of Ely had an order for
    ten bucks from an Essex forest, but because they were hard to take he
    had a similar order on Rockingham, to be used should the first attempt
    fail. A certain Ivo de Dyen taken in the forest had fined to King
    John eight marcs and a palfrey for his freedom, and paid it to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
    constable, for which he now has a quittance. William de Cantilupe has
    two bucks and two does from the forest to put into his park at Eston.
    Martin de Patishull has ten bucks. Some timber allowed for the castle
    is to be selected by the foresters and verdurers, who are to take a
    receipt (talliam) for it from the sheriff.</p>

  <p>In 1226 ten dolia of wine were sent to the castle. In this year Ralph
    de Trublevill was to have timber from some convenient spot where the
    forest would not be injured, for the bay of the king‚Äôs vivary at
    stoke and the repair of his houses. The custos has twenty marks
    from the sheriff for works at the chapel and other parts of the castle.
    The Sheriff of Beds is also to supply twenty marcs for these works; a
    load of lead is ordered for the gutters of the roof. 15th August, the
    constable is to have two bucks in season [in horis]. 24th July, 1227,
    the constable is to pay over his receipts for the past and present year
    from Rockingham fair to Thomas de Cyrene, or his bailiff of that vill,
    and he is to leave them with him in future. William de Cantilupe is
    allowed to take two bucks in season. In 1230 three casks of wine were
    sent to the castle from Boston.</p>

  <p>After some lapse of time an inquisition of 34 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1249‚Äì50,
    states that the castle was left ruinous by Sir Robert Basselewe,
    the last constable. It mentions the tower, the walls, and their
    battlements. The chapel was destitute of fittings for divine service.</p>

  <p>1250, Geoffrey de Rokingham, who probably held the Weyte fee <i lang="la">in
    capite</i> under the castle, had died, and his executors were allowed
    administration on giving security for the debts due to the king.
    1284‚Äì6, the estate was not wound up, and Master Henry Sampson brought
    before the Barons of the Exchequer the pieces of a tally for ¬£4 levied
    by the Sheriff of Rutland, which tally was by mischance broken. Sampson
    seems to have been an executor. 1251, the sheriff is allowed 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
    for the carriage of the king‚Äôs venison from Rockingham to Westminster,
    and Elias de Hanvill is to take sixty oaks from the king‚Äôs woods of
    Clyve, Brigstoke, and Cottingham for works at the castle.</p>

  <p>In 1253‚Äì4 Ernald de Bosco, justice of the forests south of Trent,
    had charge of Rockingham forest between the bridges of Stamford and
    Oxendon, excepting the castle and its appendages; and he was directed
    to make ‚ÄúTrencheyns‚Äù where it seemed most expedient in the forests of
    Rockingham and Clyve. Two years later Hugh de Goldingham had the same
    charge, and four men were imprisoned in the castle for trespass. They
    paid two marcs to be allowed bail until the advent of the justice in eyre.</p>

  <p>1260‚Äì1, the king committed to Alan la Zouch the castle and the forest
    from bridge to bridge, and John de Oxindon and Walter le Butiller were
    his attorneys to account for the issues of the county and forest to the king.</p>

  <p>1269‚Äì70, Henry Engayne had licence to impark ten acres of forest,
    probably near Blatherwick. In 1271, at the close of Henry‚Äôs reign,
    Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, his nephew, had the manor of Rockingham, and
    obtained a grant for the town of a Friday market.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span></p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> was at Rockingham in 1275, 1279, 1290, and 1300, on the last
    occasion for eight days in April.</p>

  <p>3 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, 1274‚Äì5, the jurors of the Hundred found that, when the
    king came to Rockingham and stayed there, he used to have grass
    (herbagium) in grazing time for all his horses in the Abbot of
    Peterborough‚Äôs meadows on the Welland, and the constable claimed the
    same, but it appeared that since the time of Abbot de Cauz these rights
    had been lost, as well as a right to take large timber for the repairs
    of the castle, and wood to burn and for fences from the abbot‚Äôs wood
    of Cottingham. Also, about twenty-five years before, the abbot by
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">pourpresture</span>,‚Äù or unlawful enclosure, had encroached upon the king‚Äôs
    common of pasture in Estiburg, to what extent was not known. Also
    Robert Oliver had appropriated a slice of the king‚Äôs meadow, 20 rods
    by 2 feet, to enlarge his mill-race, and Geoffrey FitzPeter had built
    a wall in the king‚Äôs highway in Rockingham, and enclosed land 80 feet
    by 8 feet. Another entry states that the abbot, who held the manor of
    Cottingham <i lang="la">in capite</i>, had enclosed an assart there, on which was
    formerly common of pasture attached to the castle, and worth 40<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> per
    acre. Also for three years Berenger le Moyne and the men of Henington
    had ceased to do suit in the Hundred court of Polebroke, worth 7<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
    per annum, and castle guard 20<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> It appears also from the same Hundred
    rolls that it had been the custom from ancient times to celebrate
    divine services in the chapel within the castle, for which 50<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> was
    allowed annually by the sheriff. The celebration had ceased for eight
    years before 1268. The vill of Rockingham had been in the hands of the
    king‚Äôs predecessors, and was given by King Henry to the King of the
    Romans, whose son, Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, inherited it, and had
    the manor. The advowson of the parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard was wont
    to be in the Crown, but the jurors were ignorant, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Utrum data esset
    domino Regi Alim‚Äô cum manerio de Rokingham an non</span>.‚Äù Manton chapel was
    attached to the manor, and Henry had given it to the last pastor, who
    was still alive. The abbot, on his side, but half a century later, had
    counter-complaint to make (‚ÄúPlac. in Parl.,‚Äù ii. 22).</p>

  <p>1276‚Äì7, the Abbot of Pipewell was relieved from the toll for chiminage,
    or right of way through the forest. Thomas de Blatherstone had 9<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for
    his expenses with the king‚Äôs greyhounds and 2<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for bread for them,
    and another 5¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for bread when Master Richard de Holbroc stayed at
    Rokingham, and for the greyhounds of the Abbot of Laund for nineteen
    days, 19<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, in all 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for greyhounds.</p>

  <p>In the year 1279 was an outlay on the castle, the details of which are
    preserved.</p>

  <p>1279‚Äì80, Lawrence de Preston, one of a family who held Gretton Manor,
    complained of Roger de Hollande, constable, for ‚Äúestovers,‚Äù or wood for
    the use of the house, taken from the woods of the Abbot of Peterborough
    in Cottingham, from William de Latimer in Corby, and from Preston‚Äôs own
    wood at Gretton, ‚Äú<span lang="la">pro nimia oppressione</span>,‚Äù<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span> in taking more than were due
    to him. Ralph Basset was allowed to assart and cultivate thirty-eight
    acres in Weldon in the forest.</p>

  <p>1280‚Äì1, the king granted to Robert Fitz-Roger of Wanton that part of
    the bailliewick of Bulay in the forest which is in the king‚Äôs hands,
    and the charge of the wood of Fernes for life, saving to the king the
    rights of vert and venison. 1281, 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 2<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> are allowed the sheriff
    for carriage of the king‚Äôs venison from Rockingham to Westminster.
    1282, Richard de Holebroke has the custos-ship of the castle and
    seneschalship of the forest, with the king‚Äôs rents of Whytele and the
    manors of Saham, Oveston, and Silveston, for three years, and, 1285,
    Holebroke is again constable, and has ¬£637. 17<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8¬Ω<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for moneys
    expended by him in repairs of the castle during the past seven years.
    It is, therefore, probable that Holebroke held office before 1282. As
    he was by far the most active person who held the office, and as most
    of the older part of the castle is his work, it will be convenient
    here to quote from the Miscellaneous Rolls for 9 and 10 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>,
    a translation of the instrument by which Holebroke was appointed
    constable, which may be taken as the general form, and may thus be
    rendered:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>‚ÄúConcerning the castle of Rokingham and the office of the
      seneschalcy of the forests and the divers manors committed.</p>

    <p>‚ÄúThe king commits to Richard de Holebroke the custody of the king‚Äôs
      castle of Rokingham and the office of the seneschalcy of the
      king‚Äôs forests, between the bridges of Oxon and Staunfford, with
      the king‚Äôs rent from Whitele, and with the king‚Äôs manors of Saham,
      Oveston, and Silveston, to be held with all their appurtenances
      from the feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael in the year of the king‚Äôs reign the
      ninth, until the end of the three complete years next following,
      unless in the meantime the king should be induced to order
      otherwise concerning the aforesaid castle. Rendering thence to
      the king annually at the king‚Äôs exchequer from the issues of the
      aforesaid castle and seneschalcy 80 pounds. From the manor of Saham
      56 pounds, and from the manor of Selveston 15 pounds, that is to
      say, one moiety at the feast of the Holy Trinity, and the other
      moiety at the feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin next following. So, however, that
      the aforesaid Richard shall take nothing in the aforesaid forests

      (what is necessary) for constructing the houses of the aforesaid
      castle, and for maintaining those and other houses which are in the
      king‚Äôs aforesaid manors and, should it be necessary, for repairing
      them. And he may have herbage in the aforesaid park, preserving
      sufficient pasture for the king‚Äôs beasts there. And should it
      happen that in the meantime the king should retake that castle into
      the king‚Äôs hand, he shall preserve the aforesaid Richard without
      loss. In witness, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr> Witness the king at Westminster, the 16th day
      of November‚Äù [1282].</p>

  <p>1288‚Äì9, Walter de Langton was allowed to impark his wood of Ashley and
    twelve contiguous acres, all in the forest. 1289‚Äì90, Holebroke, still
    constable, was allowed ¬£8. 11<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11¬º<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span> expenses of the funeral
    of Walter de Levy, one of the suite of John de Brabant, who died at
    the castle and was buried at Pipwell. His bowels, however, were left
    at Rockingham, and there was a feast at his funeral. 1290‚Äì1, Elias de
    Hamul succeeded Holebroke, paying the same rental. In this year great
    complaints were made to the king of Holebroke‚Äôs conduct. William de
    Latimer, who held Corby and a wood <i lang="la">in capite</i> at 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> per annum,
    complained that Holebroke had cut down great oaks without number,
    destroying his wood, taking cartloads of underwood and branches, and
    had quartered charcoal-burners upon it for six years at ¬£10 per annum
    each. Also, that he had kept about eighty swine and one hundred goats
    there for a year in all seasons, and contrary to the charter. Lawrence
    Preston of Gretton made a similar complaint. Both accused him of
    converting public funds into his private property. Holebroke denied the
    charges, and the king promised an inquiry (‚ÄúPlac. in Parl.,‚Äù i. 36).</p>

  <p>1291‚Äì2, Thomas de Lodington was allowed to impark five acres in
    Maleswood in the forest. 1293‚Äì4, Elias de Hamul was sent to Germany,
    and Thomas de Hamul appointed in his room. 1295‚Äì6, the constable is
    to take charge of William, son of Sir John de Moravia, Herbert de
    Mirham, Alexander de Fitz-Gley, and Gregory Fitz-Owen, prisoners taken
    in Dunbar Castle. Money is allowed for their sustenance. 1296‚Äì7,
    William Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, holds the castle and forest during
    pleasure, and, 1298‚Äì9, is succeeded by Adam de Welles.</p>

  <p>In July, 1299, Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> settled the dowers of Margaret the sister,
    and Isabella the daughter, of the King of France, on the marriages
    of himself and his son, and, in the places settled on, the latter
    occur: ‚ÄúGeytington, Eston, Torpeyl, Brikstok, Clyve, and the castle
    and vill of Rokingham, with its forests, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>,‚Äù and the schedule gives
    the following interesting particulars of their value:‚ÄîGeytington, farm
    of the vill, ¬£48; of the market, 6 marcs, total, ¬£52. Eston, ¬£40.
    Torpel, ¬£100. Brikstok, with park and wood, ¬£104. 13<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> Clyve,
    with the forest, ¬£110. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 3<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> C. and V. of Rokingham, with forest,
    <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, ¬£80, being the farm of the castle and seneschalship between Oxon
    and Stamford bridges. (Mise Roll, 27 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>) Queen Eleanor‚Äôs dower
    settled on her marriage was ¬£4,500 per annum (‚ÄúCal. Rot. Chartarum‚Äù).</p>

  <p>1301, John, son and heir of Richard de Holebroc, was allowed ¬£614. 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>
    6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for extensive repairs to the castle in his father‚Äôs time.</p>

  <p>The entries during the reign of Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> are also tolerably numerous.
    1307‚Äì8, Baldwin de Manners became constable on the same terms as
    Welles, as did Alan la Zouch 1311‚Äì12. In the next year Roger de Norwich
    had the vill of Rockingham and the manor of Little Weldon. 1313, Aymer
    de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, was custos, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, on the usual terms,
    and Richard Edward had little Weldon. De Valence himself, or by his
    deputy, was to provide munition for the castle out of the issues of his
    custos-ship.</p>

  <p>1314‚Äì15, the Abbot of Pipewell was allowed 5 acres 3 rods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span> 10 perches,
    at a perch of 20 feet, for ever, from the king‚Äôs waste in the forest,
    at a rent of 2<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> 1315, the king being lord of the manor of
    Rockingham, the Saturday market was confirmed. 1319‚Äì20, John Gifford,
    clerk, had a grant of 85 acres 3 rods 9¬Ω perches in the forest in fee
    at the south side, in Tottenhowe, to be cleared and built upon. Also
    he has ‚Äúcommon‚Äù for his animals. 1323‚Äì4, beside a number of castles,
    the vill of Rockingham is committed to Humphrey de Walden and Richard
    de Iken, and next year to Iken and Richard de Wynfarthing. 1324‚Äì5,
    John de Mosteyn was constable. Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> is known to have been at
    Rockingham four times, and he here tested a score of documents, many
    of which are diplomatic instruments of great importance, and drawn up
    with much care. Queen Philippa probably had the castle in settlement
    on her marriage in 1327, for in 1329 Edward granted her 60 acres in
    the forest, in aid of the repairs of the castle, then a ruin. William
    la Zouch was allowed to make a ‚Äú<span lang="la">saltatorium</span>,‚Äù or deer-leap, within his
    manor of Haringworth in the forest, and next year Simon de Drayton had
    leave to impark Elsdale, Neusdale, and Lappe, containing 60 acres, also
    Wynescross of 10 acres, the latter outside the forest. Drayton was also
    constable and seneschal, paying yearly ¬£80. He was of Drayton, now one
    of the best preserved and charming old manor places in the forest,
    and which has never been sold or alienated. An order was issued for
    inquiry into the oppressions done by Robert de Veer while constable,
    and the Bishop of Lincoln had leave to add 60 acres to his park of
    Luddington, county Rutland, but within the forest, and to enclose the
    same within a stone wall. 1335‚Äì6, Master William de Nassington had a
    pardon and fined a marc for ‚Äú<span lang="la">pour presture</span>‚Äù and encroachment of 13
    acres 3 rods at Kaluhey, occupied by John of Kyngeswood, parson of
    Hakebourn. 1336‚Äì7, Walter de Basley, the king‚Äôs clerk, had a grant of
    two oaks in the forest from the queen, and had taken four, for which
    he is in prison. John de Verdon, constable, is to release him on bail.
    Verdon held office by the queen‚Äôs grant for life, paying ¬£80 per
    annum to the king‚Äôs consort when alive, and on her death to the king.
    1338‚Äì9, the king took the homage of Hugh, son and heir of Margery de
    Nevill, deceased, for 6 acres of arable, one of meadow and pasture, and
    20<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> rent in Medbourne, held by the service of giving a barbed arrow
    whenever the king came to the castle.</p>

  <p>1339‚Äì40, the forest wastes were to be measured; and two years later
    were to be inquired into in the forests of Rockingham, Salcy, and
    Whichwood. 1345‚Äì6, Thomas Wake of Blisworth had licence to assart 250
    acres of land and pasture within the forest for which the pr√¶positus
    and brethren, chaplain of John Gifford‚Äôs Chantry in Cotterstock and
    their successors are to pay annually 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> per acre. They also pay a
    fine of ¬£5. The lands are ‚Äú<span lang="la">nuper arentatis</span>.‚Äù 1347, the Lieutenant of
    the Tower of London is to send ten Scots prisoners to John de Verdon,
    Constable of Rockingham, or his deputy, Thomas Stone. 1348‚Äì9, Simon
    Simeon has leave to enclose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span> his wood of Grafton in the forest with a
    little ditch and a low hedge, and five years later he has permission to
    impark it.</p>

  <p>20 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1346‚Äì7, the king, in aid of the repairs of the castle,
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">qui noviter dirutus est et prostratus</span>,‚Äù grants to the queen 60 acres
    of wood in his park of Bukelestrode within the forest on lease for her
    life (Abb. Rot. Orig.). The queen, however, had it not all her own way,
    for 1356‚Äì7 is a memorandum for staying her assarts in the forest. In
    this year the Abbot of Pipewell has the advowson of Geddington, and is
    to restore to the king in fee his lands in Benefield.</p>

  <p>1371‚Äì2, and again in 1375‚Äì6, the king confirms the queen‚Äôs grant to
    Walter de Wright of pannage, herbage, dead wood, ‚Äú<span lang="la">copreneo</span>,‚Äù brushwood
    (cablicio), bullrushes (cirpos), and all fallen branches, within the
    park of Brigstoke, and the bailliewicks of Geddington and Bulay, within
    the forest of Rockingham, also timber for the park pales for life, at
    ¬£10 per annum. 1371‚Äì2, Henry Mulso has a lease for five years, at ¬£42
    per annum, of all the king‚Äôs ‚Äú<span lang="fr">rentes d‚Äôassart</span>‚Äù in the forest. 1375‚Äì6,
    Almaric de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Amand, chivaler, has the castle and fortress at the old
    rent of ¬£80. 24th August, 1375, the truce of Bruges between England and
    France was confirmed by Edward, ‚Äú<span lang="fr">Don‚Äô a noster chastel de Rockingham</span>.‚Äù</p>

  <p>In 1381, Sir John de Clyfton claimed to hold the manors of Rockingham
    and Wymundham by the service of butler at coronations, which service he
    complains had been usurped by the Earl of Arundel.</p>

  <p>The importance of the castle and the exclusive jealousy of encroachment
    on forest rights were now on the decline. Encroachments were made upon
    the woodlands both for private parks and for cultivation, and the
    castle was neglected. The forest offices were, however, still coveted,
    and continued to be so for some centuries. 1387, Sir William de Thorpe
    had the bailliewicks of Brikestoke, Gettington, and Bulay for life.
    1396, William Brancepath has the charge of the lordship of Rockingham
    for twelve years at ¬£4. 2<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 1<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> At this time it was under the Duchy of
    Cornwall.</p>

  <p>The reign of Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> opens upon Rockingham with a grant of the charge
    of the park of Clyve for life, and early in that of Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> is an
    appointment of itinerant judges to hear pleas in Rockingham forest.</p>

  <p>1439‚Äì40, Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> granted to the master of the College of Fotheringay
    20 acres of waste in Shortwood, near Southwick in Kingscliff
    bailliewick for 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, with permission to assart. In 1440, the
    vineyard mentioned in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> was extant, and worth 4<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>
    per annum; and 1442‚Äì3, Sir Robert Ross, one of the king‚Äôs carvers
    (trencheatorum), and much employed in diplomacy, has a grant in tail
    male of the castle and lordship of Rockingham, and the seneschalship of
    the forest from Stamford to Oxendon bridges, the supervisorship of the
    parish of Brigstock, pannage, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, at ¬£75. 16<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> per annum, which
    was held by Henry, his son, in 1450. 1445, the tenants of Southwick
    manor are allowed common of pasture in the forest. 1450, Richard, Duke
    of York, is consti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>tuted justice in eyre of the southern forests, and
    of Rockingham between the bridges, and of the king‚Äôs parks of Cliffe
    and Brigstoke for life. An entry in the ‚Äú<span lang="la">Inquisitiones ad quod damnum</span>‚Äù
    shows that, between 1448‚Äì55, the ‚Äúmen and tenants‚Äù of the town of
    Northampton held the office of king‚Äôs escheator. In the long list
    of crown revenues enumerated in the proceedings of Parliament, 28
    Henry <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, 1450, the farms, rents, pasture, and profits of assarts in
    Rockingham forest are set down at ¬£26. 3<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> per annum. In 1454, Henry
    settled upon Queen Margaret, with much other property, the castle,
    lordship, manor, and forest of Rockingham, with its assarts, rents,
    <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, the vill of Brigstoke, and the bailliewicks of Brigstock and
    Clyffe, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> first appears in the forest by a concession in 1462‚Äì3 to the
    tenants of his vills of Nassington and Yarewell of an annual tax called
    Woodhallmarc exacted by the officers of the forest; he also granted
    them free common for their beasts in Seveley, and generally in the
    forest.</p>

  <p>1462‚Äì3, the king made an ample grant to William, Lord Hastings, and
    Ralph Hastings, Esq., to be constables of the castle and forests of
    Rockingham, and bailiffs of Clyve and Brigstoke, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, for their lives;
    Lord Hastings also had the manor of Stoke d‚ÄôAlbini. 1467‚Äì8, Edward
    settled the manor upon his queen, Elizabeth Widville, with the castle
    and forest, for life.</p>

  <p>One of the old forest laws forbade those who held woods of their own
    within the forest boundary from enclosing them after felling the
    timber, for the protection of the rising wood, for more than three
    years. The king in Parliament, 1482, 22 Edward <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, extended this time
    to seven years.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>, soon after his accession, confirmed to John, Lord Welles,
    the office of constable and steward of the castle, lordship, and
    manor, of Rockingham, and of master forester of all the parks within
    the forest. He seems, however, 4th March, 1498, to have settled the
    whole upon Elizabeth his queen for life. In the schedule attached to
    the king‚Äôs declaration, pro hospitio Regis, 1485, 1 Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>, the
    revenues of Cliffe, Brigstocke, Geddington, the Forest, Corby, and
    Gretton, are set down at ¬£208.</p>

  <p>Edward <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, 1551‚Äì2, granted the manor, as part of the Duchy of
    Cornwall, to Edward, Lord Clinton. 27th June, 1553, occurs a grant to
    Lord Robert Dudley and William Glaseour of tenements in Rockingham, and
    in Eston, co. Leicester, late parcel of the lands of the late William
    Lord Parr, and late in the occupation of Edward Watson. This was Sir
    Edward Watson who had the manor of Rockingham, 28 Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, and was
    father of Henry Watson, √¶t. 16, 16 Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr> Probably, however, that
    was a sub, or mesne-manor, for the castle and manor of Rockingham were
    in the crown in the reign of Philip and Mary.</p>

  <p>In 1570, 21st April, the Earl of Northampton informs Cecil that Edward
    Watson of Rockingham has been required by the Council to contribute 100
    marcs to the loan. Probably this should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span> 1,000, or ¬£337. 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr>, for,
    he adds that in his opinion not more than ¬£50 should be required of him
    (‚ÄúState Papers,‚Äù Dom.).</p>

  <p>In 1571 Sir Walter Mildmay has a grant of forest land, probably near
    Apethorpe.</p>

  <p>In 1592, the Lord Treasurer Burghley has the keepership of the forest
    for life, excepting Great and Little Brigstock parks, as the late Lord
    Chancellor had it. When Lord Burghley died the keeper or wardship was
    given, 1598, to his son. From this time the grants of bailliewicks,
    forest walks, lands, and forest offices are very numerous.</p>

  <p>In 1601, 23rd December, Elizabeth granted the forest in free socage
    to be held of the manor of Hampton Court to Edward Watson and William
    Whitock, for ¬£96. 1<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> What this grant meant is uncertain: not the
    whole forest, for the keepership of this was granted to Lord Burghley,
    Sir William Cecil, and Lord Roos, with survivorship.</p>

  <p>26th October, 1604, the deer had become scarce, and Lord Burghley
    was restrained from killing any for three years. In this year an
    inquisition was directed into the forest lands held by the king‚Äôs
    tenants, the crown interests having evidently been much neglected.</p>

  <p>In January, 1605, notice was given that James intended to visit
    Rockingham, and commissioners sat, probably to check abuses, before
    whom, 14th June, Sir Thomas Tresham was summoned for his discourses on
    the misgovernment of the forest under Edward <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>, Mary, and Elizabeth,
    matters which he hoped James would reform.</p>

  <p>In 1609 the commissioners were prepared to agree to compositions from
    the holders of assarted lands, excepting, however, in Clyffe, and
    probably some other parts of the forest. They were also selling the
    woods, but as the game had been diminished by unlawful hunting it was
    ordered that for three years no claims for deer should be allowed save
    under the sign manual. At that time Sir C. Hatton was keeper of the
    Launde of Benyfield in the forest.</p>

  <p>29th October, 1609, Sir Edward Watson wrote to Lord Salisbury that the
    king‚Äôs tenants in Cotingham and Middleton desired to purchase these
    lands, and he himself offers to purchase his court leet and view of
    frankpledge.</p>

  <p>2nd June, 1610, John Browne has ¬£170. 0<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 4<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for the repairs of the
    lodges of Geddington, Morehay, and Gretton woods.</p>

  <p>In 1611, 19th September, Sir Lewis Watson, of Rockingham, had licence
    to travel.</p>

  <p>1615, 12th June, Sir Robert Lane was proceeded against by the
    attorney-general for encroachment on the forest.</p>

  <p>1616, Sir Edward Watson, whose effigy is seen in the church, became
    possessed of the manor of Rockingham. 1619, 20th June, George, Marquis
    of Buckingham had a grant of Rockingham Park, which, in the same year,
    he conveyed to Sir Lewis Watson; and 1621, 23rd March, Buckingham,
    then Lord High Admiral, had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span> grant of 200 oaks from Westhay walk,
    to be selected by himself. 1624, 14th May, the Earl of Exeter, then
    Lord Warden of the forest, mentions the land of Murie as one of the
    prime walks. The verdurers seem to have been country gentlemen of
    consideration in the neighbourhood; Sir Thomas Tresham was one. 20th
    July, Robert Lane, who had been displaced by the Montague interest
    with the Earl of Exeter, asks Lord Salisbury to replace him as keeper
    of Geddington woods. In 1625, 23rd March, a warrant is issued for the
    repairs of the chief lodge in Corby woods, and ¬£16 and 10 tons of
    timber are allowed.</p>

  <p>1628, 29th January, John Lord Mordaunt has the forestership of Farming
    woods at ¬£10 per annum, with a fine of ¬£1,150, and Edward Lord Montague
    has that of Geddington at ¬£10, with a fine of ¬£850. Soon after he
    purchased the timber, and is mentioned as having the revenue of
    Rockingham bailliewick. Nicholas Pay and others had a grant from Lords
    Peterborough and Westmoreland of all timber trees in the walks of
    Morehay, Westhay, and Farming woods for ¬£2,000, and Lord Montague that
    of Geddington walk for ¬£1,000. He also had a grant of the office of
    master forester and keeper of Rockingham bailliewick for three lives.
    These two lords seem to have been in favour with Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and on the
    death of the Earl of Exeter in 1629 to have managed the forest in their
    own interests. In 1630‚Äì1 Mary, Countess of Westmoreland, seeks to have
    her son made justice in eyre for the forest, of which it will give her
    the command. In 1635 Sir Christopher Hatton claims Gretton and Weldon
    woods in the Forest Court, by grant from Queen Elizabeth, as does Sir
    W. Tresham Geddington by grant from James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> In this year, 11 Charles
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, was held an ‚Äúeyre‚Äù for Rockingham forest. Certain tenants claimed
    ‚ÄúSuite-Thornes,‚Äù by the custom of the manor, in addition to house-bote,
    hedge-bote, gate-bote, and common of pasture.</p>

  <p>In 1637‚Äì8, 13 Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, a new perambulation was ordered, to settle
    the bounds, which were finally agreed to as those of 20 James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and
    made the subject of an Act of Parliament, 17 Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> Deafforestation
    was allowed on reasonable composition, only the Surveyor General was
    to set out the bailliewick of Rockingham, Clyffe, and Brigstock, to be
    retained for the king‚Äôs sport. Lord Treasurer Juxon was president of
    the new commission, which met in London, at London House, in 1638. At
    that time Henry, Earl of Holland, was justice in eyre, and seems to
    have had much to do. Richard Lane was his deputy. In 1638 Sir C. Hatton
    applied for leave to fell a coppice. The verdurers are to certify
    the acreage to the chief justice, and whether the wood may be felled
    without injury to the game. The certifyers are Sir Lewis Watson and
    Charles Cockayn. Thomas Dove, a verdurer, has leave from the chief
    justice to hawk in moderation. There are great complaints of poaching.
    In this year, William, Earl of Salisbury, had a release for two fines
    of ¬£1,400 and ¬£6,000, inflicted by the justice, probably for serious
    encroachments, and his park at Brigstock, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span> had been laid open,
    is to be re-parked. 1638‚Äì9, John Norwich of Brampton pays ¬£400 for
    encroachments, and Brampton is disafforested.</p>

  <p>In 1639 the troubles had commenced, and 29th June the manor
    of Rockingham was confirmed to Sir Lewis Watson, who held the
    castle for the king. In 1643 the tide of civil war flowed towards
    Northamptonshire. 5th April, the castle had been besieged and taken,
    and Lord Grey of Groby was in command for the Parliament. He fortified
    it strongly with palisades, and therein sheltered his troops and
    certain of the disaffected clergy. 7th May, the castle contained a
    strong garrison and was used to preserve the peace of the district.
    19th May, Sir Lewis Watson was captured by Colonel Hastings and taken
    to Stoke Albini. The colonel was active throughout the forest. 5th
    June, Sir John Norwich was the parliamentary governor of the castle,
    and had engaged and routed the king‚Äôs guards. 9th June, 500 horse
    appeared before the castle, and a party blockaded it while the rest
    rode to Weldon. The garrison, however, were too strong, and captured
    nine or ten of the king‚Äôs chief officers who came that way from Oxford.
    29th December, Lord Grey proposed to dismiss Colonel Horsman, then in
    charge of the castle, but the Parliament upheld him.</p>

  <p>In 1645 Norwich was in command, and took many prisoners, lodging them
    in the castle. Sir Lewis probably distinguished himself in the field,
    for, 1st June, he was created Baron Rockingham of Rockingham Castle.
    7th June, the king marched from Harborough to Daventry, and on the 14th
    the battle of Naseby was fought, whence many prisoners were sent to the
    castle.</p>

  <p>In August, 1660, with the Restoration, Lord Rockingham appears, and,
    finding a scarcity of deer, begs the usual warrants may be restrained.
    In 1661, at the coronation, Edward Lord Rockingham, as tenant <i lang="la">in
    capite</i> of Little Weldon, claimed to be keeper of the king‚Äôs dogs.
    This was referred to the king. The manor was held by the service of
    keeping twenty-four buckhounds and six harriers. With the Civil War the
    value of the castle as a place of strength ceased, and it became the
    residence of the Watson family, as it has since remained.</p>

  <p>Some years ago the late Mr. Hartshorne drew up an account of the
    castle, which, with copious notices of its descent, and of its
    connexion with the forest, was printed in the first volume of the
    ‚ÄúTransactions‚Äù of the Institute. Since then, the Rev. H. J. Bigge,
    for many years rector of Rockingham, has paid much attention to the
    subject, and has made collections concerning it, for the use of which
    the present writer is much indebted.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Wiltshire Avon, which shares that well-known name with her

    ‚ÄúEastern Avon,‚Äù which</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>is one of the coldest and clearest streams in the south. Whether its
    source be taken from the high land of the Devizes, or from the skirts
    of Savernake, it runs about fifty miles to the sea at Christchurch,
    and, in that distance, itself, or by its immediate tributaries,
    traverses a tract very rich in sylvan beauty, and crowded with material
    traces of the old inhabitants of the land, and of their severe struggle
    in the sixth century with the fiery deluge by which they were at last
    swept away, but which brought with it those seeds of civilisation which
    have nowhere grown more abundant fruit than along the banks of this
    celebrated stream.</p>

  <p>Much of the upper course of the Avon lies across Salisbury Plain, where
    it cleaves that table-land of the chalk by a valley full of sudden but
    not ungraceful bends and secluded nooks, each bright and rich with
    vegetation, and in almost every bend a village and its church, there
    being twenty of the latter in the same number of miles between the
    entrance of the Avon into the chalk at Beaching-Stoke and the expansion
    of its ravine at Salisbury. The lower valley is broad and flat, and the
    waters flow freely in many inosculating channels. The lowlands are laid
    out as rich water meadows, the uplands studded with masses of oak, elm,
    and beech, the skirts of the adjacent New Forest. Nothing can be more
    wild, more natural, nor yet more indebted to the labour and taste of man.</p>

  <p>For antiquities, every part of the broad plain of the chalk is
    dotted over with marks of human habitation, warfare, or sepulture.
    Almost every headland is crowned by a camp recognised as British by
    its outline following the irregularities of the ground. Upon its
    northern frontier may be seen Easton and Pewsey, Lidbury, Sidbury,
    Chisenbury, Casterley, Broadbury, and Bratton; and, on the southern,
    Durrington, Amesbury, Quarley, Ogbury, Winterbourne, Grovely, Belbury,
    and Old Sarum, a few only, though the most considerable, of the
    defensive earthworks. Lower down the valley and nearer to the sea, the
    ground is rather less strong, and the earthworks of the British age
    perhaps less numerous, but there are not wanting examples of large
    area and great strength, such as Clearbury, Whichbury, Chiselbury,
    Tisbury, Winkelbury, and, still further south, Dudsbury, Badbury, and
    Spettisbury, which remain but little altered. Stonehenge, the grandest
    of British antiquities, and probably the only one in this immediate
    district neither military nor sepulchral, stands on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span> the right bank of
    the Avon, scarce a mile from its waters, and only six from the fortress
    of Old Sarum.</p>

  <p>The Roman remains of the district are considerable, and characteristic
    of the people. They consist almost wholly of roads. Old Sarum,
    though certainly of British origin, is the centre of several great
    roads, which radiated from it towards the Roman settlements at Bath,
    Marlborough, Winchester, Silchester, Ilchester, and Dorchester, and
    upon these and between them are various works of the same people,
    though their camps, being rarely defended by formidable works in earth,
    and being usually on low and accessible ground, have very frequently
    disappeared before the ploughshare.</p>

  <p>The English, the scourge of the later Britons, and their successors
    by the right of many a hard-won contest in the Wiltshire territory,
    notwithstanding their pagan ferocity, have left traces which speak but
    of law and order. Their dragon‚Äôs teeth have grown up, not, as might
    have been expected, in armed men, but in waving cornfields, enclosed
    pastures, parochial boundaries, and those various subdivisions of the
    land the very existence of which implies peace and private property.
    To these later invaders may be attributed such earthworks as Downton,
    the Devizes, and Ludgershal, and such ecclesiastical foundations as
    Wimborne and Christchurch. The Norman remains in and about the valley
    of the Avon differ in no material respect from those in other parts
    of England, being grafted, where circumstances admitted of it, upon
    the existing works. Thus the grand earthworks at the Devizes, at
    Marlborough, at Ludgershal, at Twynham, all probably of English origin,
    were crowned with keeps of masonry, as was the central mound at Old
    Sarum, and on the borders of the district the very curious work at
    Wareham, and the natural, but early occupied hill, at Corfe.</p>

  <p>Old Sarum is a very noteworthy place; in some respects the most
    noteworthy in Britain. Selected at some remote period and fortified
    with appliances of a simple character, it is the principal stronghold
    of a district very rich in military earthworks, and which at one time
    was the resort of inhabitants whose huts and wigwams, and the monuments
    of their superstition, covered the adjacent downs, and whose sepulchral
    monuments, ascending to the stone age, point, by their contents, to
    an early, and, by their number, to a long-continued population. The
    earlier and later Britons, Celtic or Belgic tribes, the Romans, and the
    English, have each here left traces of their rule; the Celt, partly in
    the fragments of an ancient nomenclature, but chiefly in mere material
    works, curious, indeed, and grand, but which are in no way connected
    with the later inhabitants of the country; the Romans, in those
    marvellous public ways, many of which are still in use; and the English
    in those names, boundaries, and customs, which are associated with our
    religion and our civilisation.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the mound of Old Sarum is a spot on which the descendant
    of the Welsh-speaking Britons has a right to feel pride. All around it
    savours of the remote antiquity of his race. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>Norman fortress,
    the city, the cathedral church, have all vanished; their very ruins
    have perished, and the knowledge of their arrangements has only been
    recovered by the accident of a rainless summer. Even the traces of
    Roman and English residence within the vast enclosure are uncertain
    and obscure. The seats of spiritual and civil authority were removed
    in the thirteenth century, and the military sway did not long survive.
    Political power, indeed, by a strange anomaly, lingered there until
    our own day, and is redeemed from oblivion only by its accidental
    connection with the name of the elder Pitt. But this also has departed.
    The bare and gaunt banks and mounds, the skeleton of the past life, are
    all that is left, and here, as at Stonehenge, the memory of the Briton
    is once more predominant.</p>

  <p>Old Sarum is a rudely circular and concentric earthwork, of unusual
    height and area, and of more historic celebrity than is attached to
    any other mere bank of earth in Britain, however stupendous. Moreover,
    though really as much a natural knoll of chalk as Windsor, its sharp
    outline and obviously artificial finish invest it, to the ordinary
    observer, with the character of a work of man, and thus prodigiously
    enhance the admiration with which it is wont to be regarded. Old Sarum
    is really a knoll of the lower and flint-bearing chalk series, of
    which advantage has been taken to scarp and elevate the highest and
    central part into a steep flat-topped mound, round which is excavated a
    formidable ditch, very broad and very deep. Beyond the ditch is a broad
    and comparatively level annular area, sloping slightly from the centre,
    and in its turn girdled by a second and still more formidable ditch. Of
    this the counterscarp is a steep bank, outside of and beyond which is
    the natural slope of the base of the hill, forming what, in military
    phrase, would be the glacis of the place, and which, on three sides,
    descends into the ordinary valleys of the district, but to the west is
    continued downwards until it dies into the meads of Stratford, rendered
    bright and well wooded by the fertilising waters of the Avon. The whole
    height of the knoll above the river may be 300 feet, and perhaps 200
    feet above the other valleys, and the fortified area is above 27 acres,
    so that the fortress is one of great strength and magnitude.</p>

  <p>Commencing with the interior, the central mound is, at its top, about
    500 feet across. The sides are as steep as the rubbly chalk soil
    will well admit of, and the material removed in scarping seems to
    have been, in part, placed on the crest of the scarp so as to raise
    the edge of the mound by an artificial bank, about 20 feet above the
    central platform. This bank or parapet, now crowned with thorn-bushes,
    is about 100 feet above the bottom of the ditch, and about half that
    height above the level of the counterscarp. The ditch is about, at its
    broadest, 150 feet. This ditch was the inner fosse of the fortress, and
    surrounded its keep or inner ward, or the castle proper.</p>

  <p>The annular space beyond formed the outer ward, the girth of which was
    about 1500 yards, and within which were the city and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span> the cathedral.
    This ward is not quite circular, but, measuring from the inner to the
    outer ditch, averages about 370 feet. It is parted nearly equally on
    the north side by a bank, and on the south by a bank and ditch, the
    former being on the eastern side. These run as radial lines, but do
    not reach the interior ditch, neither does the cross ditch communicate
    with the exterior one. In fact, the cross ditch, in its breadth, depth,
    and irregularity, much resembles a quarry, and very probably was
    opened to supply material for the hearting or substance of the castle
    walls. Besides these is another bank, pointing to the south-east, so
    that the whole area is divided into three sections, of which two lie
    in the eastern half. Of course, the object of these banks was to shut
    in the church, and to prevent the whole outer ward being taken by a
    <i lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>. They are all evidently additions to the circular
    works, and probably of the Norman period. With these exceptions the
    surface of this ward is nearly level, but round its outer edge runs a
    low bank, and in places, in its rear, a slight ditch, no doubt caused
    by the removal of the wall.</p>

  <p>Outside this ward is the outer ditch, about 106 feet deep from the
    crest and about 150 feet broad. The bank, which forms the outer edge
    of this ditch, was evidently formed from its contents. It is about 40
    feet above the bottom of the ditch, and about 15 feet above the level
    outside, and it is very steep. This forms the outer line of defence,
    and in modern warfare would be considered a weakness, as affording
    cover to the assailants. Thus the fortress is composed of an inner or
    castle ward, and an outer or city ward, with a bank and ditch defending
    each, and a third bank beyond and on the edge of the outer ditch. The
    outer ditch and bank are those attributed to Alfred. The diameter
    of the whole place is a mean of 1,700 feet. These defences are much
    stronger than those of the adjacent camps; Barnbury and Amesbury banks,
    for example, are about half their strength. The earthwork most worthy
    to be compared with Old Sarum is Badbury, in Dorset.</p>

  <p>There are two entrances into the outer ward from the E.S.E. and W.N.W.,
    nearly opposite. These are formed by a direct cross-cut through the
    outer bank, and the filling up the ditch so as to carry a roadway,
    which enters the outer ward in a cutting, as a hollow way. At the
    eastern or main entrance this way is shallow, and speedily dies out,
    but at the western, called the Postern entrance, though narrow, the
    roadway is much deeper, and runs far into the ward. In each case the
    way forks at the outer bank, and in the angle is placed a barbican of
    earth, a sort of cavalier, commanding both branches of the road as well
    as their combination. The eastern work is nearly rectangular, sharply
    defined, and has an independent ditch of its own towards the field. It
    is, probably, in its present form, Norman. The original entrances seem
    to have been here, but the present arrangement is evidently later, and
    possibly altogether Norman.</p>

  <p>The inner ward has but one, an eastern entrance, opposite to that of
    the outer ward. This also is formed by a notch cut in the scarp, the
    ditch being filled up to carry a footway. This must always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span> have been
    very steep. It was evidently always the entrance, the bank elsewhere
    being uncut. Fragments of masonry show it, in its present form, a
    bridge being substituted for the causeway, to have been the entrance to
    the Norman castle.</p>

  <p>Besides these earthworks are certain remains of masonry, parts
    evidently of very extensive and solid works, due to the Norman period.</p>

  <p>At the entrance to the inner ward, on the scarp, are two masses of
    chalk-flint rubble, with occasional blocks or lumps of sarsden stone,
    evidently the core of a gatehouse and contiguous curtain once faced
    with ashlar. The <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall seems to have crested the mound
    all round, the present bank forming a ramp behind it. In the enclosure,
    on the north side, are lines of foundation, obviously those of the
    principal buildings, and opposite is a bold depression in the soil, no
    doubt marking the place of the well, which must have been deep, and was
    possibly large. The filling up of the ditch at the entrance is clearly
    modern. This central mound may be original, but it is rather more
    probable that the British work resembled Badbury, which has no central
    citadel, and that this latter was added, and the ditch excavated in the
    eighth or ninth century, to make a fortified residence for the English
    lord. This, however, must always be a mere speculation. By whomsoever
    made, the Normans found the mound here, and built upon it a shell, of
    which the ditch was the defence, and the interior bank the ramp. If the
    whole area be regarded as a castle, this was the keep, but if, as is
    more probable, the outer area represented the city, then the interior
    would be the castle, which in that case must be held to have had no
    keep. It is a question of names only.</p>

  <p>The other lump of masonry is on the line of the wall of the city
    ward, towards the north-east. This is part of the curtain wall of the
    city, about 10 feet thick and 12 feet high, and 25 feet long. It is
    pierced by two holes, 18 inches high by 12 inches broad, placed about
    6 feet apart and 8 feet from the ground. They seem to have carried
    two beams, for what purpose it is vain to conjecture. The fragment
    is of chalk-flint rubble, with occasional chain courses of sarsden
    stone rudely dressed. The inner face of the wall retains its original
    facing of dressed sarsden ashlar. Though placed, as indeed, with such
    a weight, was prudent, 3 feet or 4 feet within the edge of the ditch,
    it was evidently a part of the general <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall, described
    as having been 12 feet thick, and strengthened with twelve towers. This
    could not have been less than 20 feet high, and about 1,566 yards long,
    a prodigious work, even without considering the radial walls dividing
    the city from the cathedral. Unfortunately, these walls have all been
    removed down to and in most places somewhat below the level of the
    soil, the materials having been needed for the new city.</p>

  <p>Besides these works, there was discovered, in 1795, a curious
    subterranean passage, which passed from the north-west quarter of the
    outer ward, outwards, towards the eastern ditch. It was cut in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span> the
    chalk 7 feet broad and from 7 feet to 10 feet high, bearing marks of
    the tool. The entrance had columns and door-jambs, evidently Norman;
    and the roof was round-headed, probably artificial, as it is described
    as being only about 2 feet below the surface. There were steps cut in
    the chalk, and but little worn. It was followed 114 feet, and there
    found to be choked up with rubbish. It was closed by the farmer whose
    land was trespassed upon, and is probably still intact. No doubt this
    was a private postern, opening on the glacis or in the ditch, such as
    exist at Windsor and in other fortresses on the chalk, and of a more
    complicated character at Dover and Arques. They are all probably of
    Norman date.</p>

  <p>It may be observed, with respect to the outer defences which have been
    attributed to Alfred, that they have the peculiarity of a high bank
    outside the ditch, very unusual in Celtic camps. Probably all Alfred
    did was to deepen this ditch, and throw up the outer bank; and probably
    also all the ditches were again scarped and deepened when the Norman
    city wall was built.</p>

  <p>During the long drought of 1834 a very interesting discovery was here
    made. The outer ward was at that time laid down in turf, and upon this
    was seen in brown outline the plan of the old cathedral. It was placed
    in the north-west quarter between the secret passage and the west gate.
    The plan was a plain cross, 270 feet long by 150 feet broad, with a
    flat east end; and the chapter-house was formed by an additional bay at
    the north end of the north transept. There were double aisles to nave,
    choir, and transepts. On removing the soil the foundations were seen,
    and in them a cavity, probably the grave of Bishop Osmund, the founder.
    On the north side of the choir was a square of 140 feet, the site of
    the cloisters. Here were found also burial-grounds for clergy and laity.</p>

  <p>It is certain that the greater part of these earthworks are of
    pre-Roman origin, and that Sorbiodunum is the Latinised form of
    the British name,‚Äî‚Äúdun,‚Äù or ‚Äúdunum,‚Äù denoting an eminence; the
    figure, which, like Badbury, has been called a regular circle,
    scarcely deserves that name, the regularity, such as it is, being
    evidently caused by the natural outline of the hill; nor are the
    banks and ditches in either work laid down according to any rules of
    castrametation. The district is crowded with works, many of which are
    certainly pre-Roman, and of the places around a few, such as Wilton,
    Durrington, Verwood, Amesbury, and the Avon, retain a British element
    in their names. Most of these being constructed upon hills of irregular
    outline are themselves very irregular, so that, by comparison, Old
    Sarum and Badbury appear as regular circles. The fact is, that all
    follow the contour of the ground.</p>

  <p>That the fortress on this spot was held by the Romans, and is the
    Sorbiodunum of Antoninus, is very probable indeed. It has been
    described as the centre of six Roman roads, radiating towards
    Dorchester, Ilchester, Silchester, Winchester, Cunetio by Marlborough,
    and Aqu√¶ Solis or Bath. Of these the two from Winchester and Silchester
    have been traced up to the east gate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span> the fortress; and as much may
    perhaps be said for that from Cunetio. Dr. Guest, however, lays down
    but four roads‚Äîto Winchester, to Silchester, a western road to the
    Severn traversing the great ridge wood, and that called Achling Ditch,
    which leads direct to Badbury rings near Wimborne. Even this restricted
    view shows Sorbiodunum to have been an important Roman station,
    and there are not wanting in its neighbourhood earthworks, such as
    Rollestone and Bury Hill, of a rectangular plan, although, being on low
    ground and but slight, they are not all shown in the Ordnance Survey of
    1817 as they would be in a map of the present day. The Romans trusted
    rather to discipline and palisades than to heavy earthworks: hence
    their traces are but slight, and are often overlooked, and disappear
    before the plough. It is, however, very curious that, notwithstanding
    all these indications of Roman sway, there should be so very few
    remains of Roman habitation. Nothing whatever has been found within the
    fortress, and but very little in its suburbs.</p>

  <p>What the Belg√¶ did with Sorbiodunum, during the century and a half of
    their occupation, is unknown. This period of the history of our island
    is obscure, and yet to it has been attributed by Mr. Fergusson the
    adjacent monument of Stonehenge; the work, at least in its present
    form, of a people accustomed to the use of tools of metal, and with
    some notion of construction and of architectural effect.</p>

  <p>Sorbiodunum, recorded as Seoresbyrig, or Searbyrig, which Sir R. Hoare
    rather happily suggests may mean ‚Äúthe dry,‚Äù or ‚Äúwaterless city,‚Äù
    played a part in the Belgic and Saxon struggles. In 552 Cynric, King
    of Wessex, no inconsiderable leader of the ‚Äú<span lang="la">aspera gens Saxo</span>,‚Äù here
    conquered the Britons and probably established himself on their
    territory. Ine <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 688‚Äì725, gave certain lands to the church
    of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James in Salisbury, as did √Üthelburh, his queen, to that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Mary. According to a statement in ‚ÄúAncient Wilts,‚Äù Alfred directed
    Leofric, Earl of Wilts, to add to the fortress a ditch to be defended
    with palisades, at which all who lived within the castle, and those
    outside, were to give aid. In 960 √Üdgar held a Council here to devise
    means for keeping off the Danes: a not uncalled-for step, since in 1003
    Swein, after burning and plundering Wilton, committed like ravages at
    Seoresbyrig in his way thence to his ships. Finally, the place seems
    to have become a royal demesne of the Confessor, being so recorded in
    Domesday. Sir R. Hoare also cites a coin of that king, claiming to have
    been struck by Godred at Sarum.</p>

  <p>The Norman history of Old Sarum is an occupation of the older fortress,
    and the foundation of the early city. The invaders disturbed as little
    as possible the existing tenures and boundaries; they placed themselves
    in the English seats of property, and from them administered the old
    estates. The defences alone were changed. To walls of wattle or rude
    masonry and stockades of timber succeeded works in substantial masonry,
    and all the newly-invented appliances of a Norman fortress. At the
    time of Domesday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span> the Conqueror held some rents here; but the manor, a
    large one, was in the bishop, a very important person. To the five sees
    created in the West Saxon kingdom, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 905‚Äì9, a sixth, that
    of Wilton or Wiltshire, was shortly afterwards added, the episcopal
    seat of which was at Ramsbury. After an ineffectual attempt in 1055 to
    remove this to Malmsbury, Bishop Herman, the Lotharingian, in 1075‚Äì8,
    with the consent of the king, combined Ramsbury with Sherborne, and
    translated the seat to Sarum. Here, in the outer ward, Herman in 1078
    laid the foundation of the cathedral, which was completed or nearly so
    by his successor, Osmund de Seez, Earl of Dorset and Lord Chancellor,
    who being a wealthy baron in England and Normandy, endowed it richly
    by charter in 1091, the year before its consecration. Part of the land
    is described as ‚Äú<span lang="la">ante portam castelli seriberiensis terram ex utraque
    parte vi√¶ in ortorum domorumque canonicorum necessitate</span>.‚Äù The gate
    referred to is of the inner ward, the canons‚Äô houses having been on the
    outer. There was thus a castle twenty-five years after the Conquest;
    but whether it was a Norman structure or that left by the English is
    uncertain, probably something of both. Here also Bishop Osmund arranged
    the celebrated ordinary for ‚Äúthe use‚Äù of Sarum. Roger, his successor,
    Justiciary of England and Treasurer, is said to have walled in the
    outer enclosure between 1102 and 1139.</p>

  <p>Concurrently with the cathedral, and probably by the Bishop, was
    constructed the Norman castle. William was here in 1086 in person,
    and at Lammastide met his Witan in the celebrated gemote which has
    been described in glowing terms by the great master of topographical
    history. Here in the vast open plain about the fortress assembled a
    host reputed at 60,000 men, composed of ‚Äúall the landowners who were of
    account over all England, be they the men of what man they might, and
    they all submitted to him, and were his men, and swore to him oaths of
    fealty, that they would be faithful to him against all other men‚Äù; an
    oath by which the great king broke down the intermediate power of the
    nobles, and with that sagacity which in him was intuitive avoided the
    rock on which the two great monarchies of the Continent were destined
    to make shipwreck.</p>

  <p>We may suppose that during this meeting William dwelt on the central
    mound, where no doubt the walls of the castle within rose at an equal
    rate with those of the cathedral without. But whether he was harboured
    in the unaltered English residence or in the rising Norman fortress,
    whether the host was Edward de Sarisburie, the Sheriff of Wilts and a
    great man in that county, and ancestor of the Earls of Salisbury, or
    whether Bishop Osmund acted as the castellan, here William was present,
    and here he transacted his first and most important business, face to
    face with his new subjects.</p>

  <p>William Rufus was here in 1096 to meet his Council, and decide upon
    the celebrated wager of battle in which William, Earl of Eu, was
    worsted and tortured to death. Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> was here in 1106 and 1116, when
    his nobles swore to recognise Prince William as his successor. The
    Pipe-roll of this reign, 1130‚Äì1, records a charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span> 20<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> ‚Äú<span lang="la">in ostio
    faciendo ad cellarium turris Sarum</span>,‚Äù so that the place was then in the
    king‚Äôs hands.</p>

  <p>Bishop Roger, who held the see from 1102 to 1139, and crowned the
    mighty mound of the Devizes and the strong knoll of Sherborne with
    their celebrated works in masonry, is likely enough to have completed
    the inner shell above as well as the city wall below. He is further
    said to have walled in the borough and extra-parochial district
    outside the city, covering, with it, above 72 acres. He at first
    supported Stephen, but had to surrender the castle, which was taken
    and retaken, and finally much injured. Maud created Patrick, son of
    Edward de Sarisburie, Earl of Salisbury, and probably invested him with
    the government of the castle. He died 1167. In 1154, when the castle
    was held by Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, it was in ruins. Henry, in the early years of
    his reign, authorised payment (as appears in the Pipe-roll) for the
    constable, porters, and watchmen of the castle, and for buildings at
    the prison; and in 23 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> ¬£61 was spent in repairs there. In
    1164‚Äì5, when the Liber Niger of the Exchequer was compiled, the bishop
    was lord of the manor, and under him were thirty-three knights under
    the old feoffment, and three under the new. Earl Patrick held two
    knights‚Äô fees, and a third by the tenure of guarding the castle.</p>

  <p>So long as the bishops held the castle, either independently or for
    the Crown, the position of the cathedral was sufficiently secure, but
    when lay castellans took their place, and were men powerful enough to
    ill-treat their neighbours, the clergy began to suffer, and to make the
    most of the natural disadvantages of so high and exposed a situation.
    They suffered ‚Äú<span lang="la">ob insolentiam militis et ob penuriam aqu√¶</span>.‚Äù Peter of
    Blois, himself a canon, says, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Est ibi defectus aqu√¶</span>.‚Äù The wind was
    high, water was dear, and the soldiery held the gates even of the city
    ward, and went so far as to threaten the buildings from their ramparts
    above, and even to shut out the ecclesiastics when returning in
    procession to their homes. The church was ‚Äú<span lang="la">castro comitis vicina</span>,‚Äù and
    the vicinity was unpleasant.</p>

  <p>Under Bishop Herbert le Poer, who succeeded in 1194, these disputes
    reached their height, and he decided to remove the cathedral to a spot
    of ground near the confluence of the Wily and the Nadder with the
    Avon, rather above a mile distant. Merefield, a marshy spot but with
    an excellent foundation, was granted by Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> for the site of the
    new church. Bishop Herbert died in 1219, but his successor and natural
    (germanus) brother, Richard le Poer, obtained from Honorius <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> the
    bull necessary for the translation, in which the causes for it are set
    forth. They are the dangerous position, as regarded the castle, of the
    houses of the clergy; the exposure, the wind being at times so high
    that the clergy could not hear one another‚Äôs voices in the choir, and
    which produced continual need for repairs; and finally the scarcity of
    water, only to be obtained at a great cost and with the castellan‚Äôs
    leave. This latter objection may have been exaggerated, for, besides
    the well in the castle, there were, says Leland, four wells in the
    outer ward, and at this time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span> there are two not very deep wells in
    gardens not very much below the cathedral level. No doubt, however, the
    removal was called for:</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza" lang="la">
          <div class="i0">Quid domini domus in castro, nisi f≈ìderis arca</div>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  <p>Early in 1219 the new cathedral was founded. It was forty years
    building, and was consecrated in 1258.</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  <p class="noindent">And finally Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> in 1227, confirmed the ‚Äú<span lang="la">translatio de castro
    nostro Saerisberi√¶ ad locum inferiorem</span>,‚Äù and declared the city ‚Äú<span lang="la">qu√¶
    dicitur nova Sarisbiria, sit libera civitas</span>.‚Äù The city had thus
    followed in the train of the cathedral. The taxation accounts of
    the reigns of Richard and John show it to have been but moderately
    populous, but it probably took some time to remove, for it was 44 Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1260, before the new city was granted by the king to the bishop
    ‚Äú<span lang="la">in capite</span>,‚Äù as parcel of the temporalities of the see, the citizens
    being the demesne men of the bishop.</p>

  <p>All parties gained greatly by the change. The new church was
    constructed at one period, and in a very pure style, and has ever
    since been regarded as the pride of the Western counties. The citizens
    exchanged an arid and stormy position for one sheltered and fertile,
    watered by the confluence of three streams, and shaded by forest
    trees of uncommon grandeur. The lords of the castle had no longer a
    cause for their perpetual disputes with the clergy and the burghers,
    and held their watch and ward undisturbed by chants and processions.
    Circumstances, however, rendered the castle, as a military post, of
    less importance than heretofore, and, though the powerful earls who
    bore its title were even more distinguished than their predecessors,
    their distinction was but little associated with their castle, which
    fell gradually into disuse. The Montacutes, indeed, continued to
    possess it, but the Nevills concentrated their power on the Midland and
    Northern counties, and Warwick, Raby, and Middleham were to them what
    Sarum had been to their precursors in the title. Finally, when arms
    yielded to the gown, and the great minister of the great Queen chose,
    under her successor, Salisbury for his title of honour, he had more
    regard to the thriving city, or to the greatness attached to the name,
    than to the ruined fortress, of which he was not even the possessor.</p>

  <p>Considering the importance of the castle, and the power of those
    who bore its name, it is surprising that so little should be known
    of its history. Mr. Nichols, in an excellent paper printed in the
    volume of the Arch√¶ological Institute for Salisbury in 1851, enters
    upon the history of the earldom, and shows that, beginning with the
    Conqueror‚Äôs sheriff, who must have taken his name from the place,
    there was a second Edward de Salisbury, whose successor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span> Walter, a
    baron under King Stephen, the father of Patrick, the first earl, whose
    son, William, the second earl, was father of the celebrated Countess
    Ela. All these lords seem to have held the castle under the Crown,
    themselves appointing castellans.</p>

  <p>Ela, the heiress of William of Salisbury, the second earl, laid the
    fifth stone of the new cathedral. She married William with the Long
    Sword, son of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, who became earl in her right, and held the
    castle. He was much abroad, and the castellan, his deputy, resided.
    This officer, in King John‚Äôs time, was Robert de Vipont, and Irish
    prisoners were kept here. In 1208 the Sheriff of Wilts was to repair
    the bridge, the ditch, and the houses in the castle. In 1266 the king
    addressed the earl as his brother on matters relating to the castle;
    and in the reigns of Richard and John occasional payments were made
    for repairs, and for the sustenance of the soldiery there. The king‚Äôs
    houses in the castle are mentioned, and wine stored there is issued to
    Gloucester and Bristol, treasure was sent thence to Southampton, and
    plate to Westminster for the coronation. King John had a balistarius in
    pay there at 9<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> a day, 100 hogs were supplied to Vipont, and in 3 John
    the earl gave thirty marcs to have the county, town, and custody of the
    castle; and Walter, the son of Albreda, gave 76<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> for the charge of
    the prison. The earl (William) was then sheriff, and was allowed for
    ¬£29. 6<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 8<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> spent by the king‚Äôs order in work at the castle.</p>

  <p>Earl William died in the castle in 1226, when Ela, his widow, had
    custody of it. Her son and grandson seem to have claimed, but never
    to have obtained, the earldom, though, when the latter died in 1256,
    his daughter Margaret, who married Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was
    known as Countess of Salisbury, probably on the death of Countess Ela
    in 1261. In 39 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1254, an Inquisition declares that no fiefs
    are held by castle guard of the castle; and, in 52 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the
    bridge within the castle was under repair, and that and the gate were
    reparable by the Abbess of Shaftesbury. In 3 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, the castle and
    manor were in the Crown, and two years later mention is made of the
    mill near the castle, no doubt the same that is entered in Domesday,
    and still remains at Stratford.</p>

  <p>In 5 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1332, the king granted licence to the bishop, dean,
    and chapter of Sarum to remove the walls of the cathedral and canonical
    houses within his castle of Old Sarum, and to employ them in the
    repairs of the church and close of New Sarum. No doubt, under this
    licence the whole material was removed down to the ground level or even
    below it, and probably the licence was held to include the outer wall
    also. At the same time, the bishop, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, had leave to rebuild a certain
    chantry on a part of the old cathedral, and to use it.</p>

  <p>In 1337 Edward‚Äôs son-in-law, William Montacute, was created Earl of
    Salisbury, and 15 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, 1341‚Äì2, an Inquisition was taken as to
    whether the earls were seized in demesne as in fee of the castle and
    vill of Old Sarum, and how they lost it. Probably this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span> was connected
    with a suit brought by Bishop Wyvil against the earl on a writ of
    right as to his title to the castle. In this Inquisition we find the
    seizure of the castle, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, by King Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> from Earl William,
    the son of the Countess Ela, thus described: ‚Äú<span lang="la">Et Juratores dicunt
    quod tempore ipsius Willielmi junioris, propter diversas discenciones
    motas inter Henricum Regem Anglie tercium proavum domini Regis nunc
    et predictum Willielmum juniorem, maxime pro eo quod idem Willielmus
    contra defensionem dicti Regis Henrici exivit regnum Anglie licencia
    Domini Regis non optenta, Dominus Rex Henricus seisire fecit in manum
    suam dicta castra villam et officium et ea in manum suam retinuit</span>.‚Äù The
    matter was at first to have been tried by battle, and each party named
    a champion; but finally it was settled by a compromise, the bishop
    paying 2,500 marcs, and the earl quitting the castle to the see for
    ever. This probably severed the connection between the earls and the
    earldom in the feudal sense.</p>

  <p>When the castle proper was dismantled has not been discovered. The
    views occasionally exhibited of it seem taken from the representation
    of Sherborne upon Bishop Wyvil‚Äôs brass in the cathedral. In Leland‚Äôs
    time the ruins were considerable; there was a lady chapel, part of the
    old cathedral, the parish church of Holy Rood, and the remains of a
    chapel over the east gate. Also in the east suburb, outside the gate,
    stood a chapel, the remains of the parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, and
    dotted about were a sufficient number of wells of sweet water to throw
    a doubt upon the validity of a part of the alleged grievance of the
    ecclesiastics. Probably, as the new city expanded, the value of the old
    material rose, and the destruction went forward with accelerated speed.
    It seems probable that, with a very little labour, the foundations of
    the inner ward could be cleared, and the well opened. It is also much
    to be regretted that the outer ward should be under the plough. The
    loss upon laying it down in turf would be trifling, and it is not too
    late to preserve the remaining inequalities of the surface.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="SCARBOROUGH_CASTLE">SCARBOROUGH CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ON the north-eastern shore of England, where the cliffs of Yorkshire
    rear a bold though broken front towards the German Ocean, there is
    seen, midway between the Tees and the Humber, or, more nearly, between
    Whitby and Flamborough Head, a tall and rugged and almost isolated
    headland of rock, which, from times beyond the records of history, has
    borne the appropriate name of Scarborough. The scaur or rugged cliff,
    the tall summit of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span> forms the natural burgh or strong place,
    rises precipitately about 300 feet from the sea beach, and has on its
    northern side the small bay of which Scalby-ness forms the opposite
    horn, and to its south the deeper and more spacious inlet, on the
    strand of which, under the protection of the scaur, is nestled the
    ancient seaport town of Scarborough.</p>

  <p>At no period when life and limb were valued and endangered could the
    advantages of Scarborough as a place of dwelling or of refuge have been
    overlooked. What art has executed at Flamborough, Nature, with a bolder
    hand, has here provided. The bay gave facilities for fishing or for
    pursuits connected with the sea, and the half-isolated cliff afforded
    security from attack from any quarter. And yet there is no evidence
    that Scarborough was regularly inhabited by either the original
    Brigantes or their Roman invaders. The adjacent wolds are scarred
    with traces of early contests, but are of too cold and too barren a
    character to have supported any considerable population, or indeed any
    population save a few shepherds. The vale of the Derwent, now rich
    and fertile, was, in Roman times, a chain of impassable swamps and
    morasses, flanked with dense and equally impenetrable forests. Neither
    Holderness nor the south of Cleveland contain many Roman remains, nor
    does there appear to have been any regular settlement by that people
    between Delgovitia and Derventio (Millington and Stamford Bridge or New
    Malton) and the eastern coast.</p>

  <p>The tract between the Humber and the Whitby Esk was invaded in the
    sixth century by a tribe of the Engles, who from invaders became
    settlers, and, as was the manner of the Teutonic tribes, finally
    consolidated themselves into a kingdom, the nucleus of the well-known
    Deira. That they inhabited the coasts of Holderness and Cleveland, the
    edges and valleys of the Wolds and of Pickering and the adjacent plain
    of York, is a matter of history, and is shown by the names of their
    settlements and the existing peculiarities of the speech of the people,
    their descendants, and by the very marked Burh of Skipsea, which has
    survived all its subsequent additions; but the rock of Scarborough,
    though as strong and almost as grand a natural feature as Bamborough,
    is not on record as a Deiran fortress, still less as a regal seat, nor
    does it exhibit, nor indeed did it need, any of those remarkable and
    well-defined earthworks which indicate the later Saxon residences. Its
    first appearance in history, though late, is creditable. When, early in
    1066, Harold Hardrada and his traitor ally Tostig wasted and pillaged
    the earldom of Morkere, the men of Scarborough met the invaders in
    arms, and made a brave, though fruitless, resistance.</p>

  <p>Scarborough is not named in Domesday, though the soke of Walesgriff,
    or Falsgrave, of which it seems to have formed a part, is therein
    recorded, and then belonged to William de Perci, the lord of eighty-six
    Yorkshire lordships, and the ancestor of that Agnes whose Louvaine
    descendants assumed her family name. Percy, however, did not long
    retain this manor, for Eudo of Champagne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span> kinsman, and by marriage
    nephew to the conqueror, on the departure of Drogo le Brevere, the
    reputed founder of the Norman works at Skipsea Castle, received from
    William the land of Holderness, and with it, probably, the adjacent
    manor of Falsgrave. Their son, Stephen, besides his paternal heritage
    of Holderness, held maternally the Norman territory of Aumarle, or
    Albemarle, from whence his mother Adeliza was styled ‚ÄúComitissa de
    Albamarla,‚Äù and Stephen, who died in 1127, bore the same title.</p>

  <p>His son, William, the second earl, lord of Holderness and founder of
    the Abbey of Meaux, took a very active part in English affairs, and
    was in his time the most powerful baron in the north. He commanded at
    the battle of the Standard in 1138, and received from King Stephen
    what Dugdale calls the earldom of Yorkshire. He died in 1179, having
    been a liberal benefactor to many Yorkshire religious houses, and
    according to William of Newburgh, who wrote in about 1190, the builder
    of Scarborough Castle. If this be so, it must have been when William
    came into the earldom, that is, soon after 1127, for on the accession
    of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, in 1154, Scarborough was one of the castles selected
    for demolition, and upon the earl‚Äôs resistance, Henry himself, after
    a severe struggle, took possession of it, and, becoming acquainted
    with the value of its position, instead of destroying, attached it
    to the Crown. Taking all this into consideration, and having regard
    to the material evidence afforded by the remains of the keep and the
    older parts of the curtain, the most probable conclusion is that Earl
    William‚Äôs fortress was of a temporary character, and the keep (arx
    magna et pr√¶clara) and the older parts of the existing masonry are the
    work of King Henry at a later period.</p>

  <p>In the Pipe-roll of 4 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> the sheriff of Yorkshire is allowed ¬£4
    for works on the castle of Scardeburc, and subsequently Henry granted
    or confirmed a charter of incorporation to the town, for the farm of
    which, 30 Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, an account was rendered by the sheriff. The town
    continued to thrive, and from time to time contributed to the ‚Äú<span lang="la">dona
    ad auxilium</span>,‚Äù to talliage and scutage. King John paid four visits to
    the castle in 1201, 1210, 1213, and 1216, remaining there altogether
    about nine days. In 1202 and 1204 John de Builly was the constable, and
    then and in 1213 military prisoners were kept there. In 1208 Builly
    was superseded by Robert de Vaux, and he again in 1215 by Geoffrey de
    Neville, the King‚Äôs Chamberlain, at which time sixty ‚Äú<span lang="la">servientes</span>‚Äù and
    ten ‚Äú<span lang="la">balistarii</span>‚Äù seem to have constituted the garrison. That John kept
    the castle in repair appears from frequent allowances for works. Wine
    also was sent there from Portsmouth, and lead for covering a tower.
    Payments occur for ‚Äú<span lang="la">servientes</span>,‚Äù ‚Äú<span lang="la">balistarii</span>‚Äù and others employed in
    the castle. During John‚Äôs reign it appears that at one time William
    de Duston was in charge, and had orders to receive William, Earl of
    Albemarle, and his companions into the castle. This was William de
    Fortibus, a Magna Charta baron, and Earl of Albemarle, in right of his
    mother, Hawise, the daughter and heiress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span> of Earl William le Gros.
    Probably he took advantage of John‚Äôs difficulties to revive a claim
    to the castle, which, however, he does not seem to have been able to
    enforce. In 1215 Neville was again in office, and had an order for 100
    marcs, ‚Äú<span lang="la">ad opus‚Äîad castrum nostrum de Scardeburg‚Äô muniendum</span>.‚Äù John de
    Neville, son of Geoffrey, took charge of the castle under Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> in
    1225, and the fortress seems to have been kept in repair all through
    that reign. In 1252 Henry granted to the town a permission for the
    construction of a new pier.</p>

  <p>The strong, and, on the whole, just government of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> led to the
    neglect of such of the castles of the kingdom as were not necessary
    for the defence of a menaced frontier, and among them of Scarborough,
    but under his son they became again of importance, and Scarborough
    reappears in the public records. Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> was here in 1312, and left
    the castle in charge of Gaveston while he proceeded to York. It was
    attacked and taken by the Earl of Pembroke, not by assault, but by
    starvation. In 1318 the town was burned by the Scots, but they do not
    appear to have been able to take the castle. Sixty years later the town
    was threatened by sea by a Scottish adventurer, who, however, failed
    to take it, and was subsequently made prisoner. For the next three
    centuries Scarborough Castle was left to fall into decay, or only so
    far repaired as to be employed occasionally as a prison. In 1536, the
    year of the Pilgrimage of Grace, Aske, who was a native of Aughton on
    the Derwent, led his ill-disciplined followers against it, but without
    success. A little later, in 1553, during Wyatt‚Äôs rebellion, it was
    taken, probably by surprise, by the Earl of Stafford, but held for
    three days only.</p>

  <p>In the contest between Charles and the Parliament in the seventeenth
    century, Scarborough, with many other Yorkshire castles, more or less
    ruinous, was held for the king, and in July, 1645, the Parliamentary
    forces laid siege to it in form. A battery was posted upon the roof
    of the chancel of the ancient parish church, about 170 yards from the
    outer gate of the castle, and a second to the north of it, upon the
    edge of the cliff in front of the barbican. The castle was taken and
    held for a short time, and in 1648, being again held for the king, it
    was a second time attacked and taken, and shortly afterwards a mine
    was sprung in the ground floor of the keep, laying open its eastern
    side. Probably the forebuilding covering the entrance to the keep was
    destroyed at the same time.</p>

  <p>The town of Scarborough was walled from an early period. Leland
    speaks of banks and ditches, and fragments of the walls, and mentions
    its two gates, Newburgh and Aldburgh, or Anborough, one of which
    remains. The town ditch extended from the castle barbican along the
    high ground southwards, and upon it, 550 yards from the barbican, was
    the Anborough gate. The town contained three friaries and one parish
    church, dedicated to the Virgin, and belonging to the Cistertians. It
    is a large building near the castle, of which the chancel, or lady
    chapel, has remained in ruins ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span> since the first Parliamentary
    siege. The platform occupied by the castle is extra parochial, usually
    an ecclesiastical, not a military privilege.</p>

  <h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>

  <p>The platform, to which the keep forms the key of the approach, is in
    plan a rhomboid, in length from north to south 600 yards, and from
    east to west 300 yards, covering about 19 acres, and its table summit
    ranges from 300 feet to 336 feet above the sea level. The two eastern
    or seaward faces, measuring together about 700 yards in length, rise
    abruptly from the sea beach, and are absolutely impregnable. The
    north-western face, 300 yards in length, and looking towards the north
    bay and sands, is lower, but still precipitous. The south-western
    face, also 300 yards in length, looks towards the town. Though not
    precipitous it is very steep, and at its base a broad ravine, known
    as the castle moat, intervenes between the castle and the town. A
    chapel and a burial-ground formerly occupied the seaward salient of
    the cliff, and behind these was Our Lady‚Äôs Well, the spring supplying
    which was reputed inexhaustible. The lowest and the only weak point in
    the platform was the landward or western angle, and here was posted
    the keep, from which northwards and southwards along the crest of the
    contiguous faces a curtain-wall was extended. Northwards, this wall
    was in length about 70 yards, ceasing as the cliff rose in height, and
    rendering artificial defence unnecessary. Southwards, the wall, from
    20 feet to 25 feet in height, was carried all along the south-western
    front, and was strengthened, either originally or at an early period,
    by ten or twelve half-round turrets of various sizes. The six smaller
    were solid, like those of Coningsborough and Knaresborough; the larger,
    from 25 feet to 30 feet diameter, were hollow. These towers were parts
    of circles in plan, and have been much mutilated. They were probably
    cut down and filled with earth during the siege of 1640, when a
    swivel-gun seems to have been mounted <i lang="fr">en barbette</i> on each. At
    present they are open at the gorge, and no higher than the contiguous
    curtain. Three loops may still be traced at their basement level, and
    two or three others at what must have been the first floor. Outside
    the wall are a number of buttresses of various sizes, shapes, and
    dates, some of which seem original, and of the late Norman period. The
    largest of these bastion towers is known as ‚ÄúThe Queen‚Äôs Tower.‚Äù Near
    the centre of this front, upon the curtain, was a building about 110
    feet by 40 feet, called ‚ÄúMossdale,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Hall.‚Äù No doubt here
    stood the hall, kitchen, and other offices for the accommodation of
    the garrison. The present building is a modern barrack, built with the
    usual disregard of taste that has long characterised such buildings.</p>

  <p>Where the curtain of the south-eastern front terminates on the sea
    cliff there seems anciently to have been a tower, known as ‚ÄúCockbill.‚Äù
    More recently a small battery has been constructed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>outside the wall,
    and upon the crest of the slope, raking the ditch, and commanding a
    part of the harbour. Probably this battery was thrown up in preparation
    for the Parliamentary siege, for the remains of the tower above it
    are known as ‚ÄúCharles‚Äôs Tower.‚Äù Although the southern curtain has
    been much mutilated and restored, and towers, bastions and buttresses
    incorporated with its substance, the greater part of it is old, and
    probably original.</p>

    <div class="caption">PLAN OF SCARBOROUGH CASTLE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>For the protection of the keep, quite as much from the mercenaries who,
    in the twelfth century, often formed the garrison, as from the exterior
    foe, an oblong space 112 yards north and south by 573 yards east and
    west, was walled in as a base court or bailey. It is taken out of the
    platform, and includes the keep. Its outer or western wall is the outer
    wall of the place, its opposite or eastern wall shuts out the keep from
    the main platform, and at the exterior foot of this wall, and within
    the platform, is a deep ditch. If the keep be regarded as the centre
    of the fortress, this enclosure is the inner ward, but as regards the
    position of the main entrance the platform deserves that name. It
    will, on the whole, be convenient to reserve the name of platform for
    the large area, and refer to the other as the bailey. Probably the
    bailey originally contained the Lords‚Äô Hall, or kitchen, chapel, and
    lodgings. All traces of these have, however, disappeared above the
    surface. The position of the well is marked by a depression in the
    sward. The entrance to the castle occupied a hollow way below, and to
    the west and north of the keep traversed the bailey close below the
    keep, and entered the platform at the point now occupied by the modern
    guard-room. The approach to the castle must always have been settled
    by the peculiar character of the ground. There is, in fact, but one
    practicable line, that along the ridge between the edge of the cliff
    overlooking the north bay and the head of the ditch between the castle
    and the town. This ridge has been fortified on one side, where the
    cliff is about 240 feet high, by a light parapet wall, and on the other
    by a much stronger wall, which branches off from the curtain of the
    bailey, and commands the head of the ditch. Where they commence the two
    walls are about 50 yards apart, but they rapidly converge, and at 70
    yards from the keep are but 12 feet apart, and thus continue, forming
    a raised causeway, along which the approach is carried. This causeway
    traverses the depression of the ground at the head of the castle moat
    by a sort of viaduct, which at its deepest point is about 25 feet
    high, and is in length, from its entrance in front of the keep to its
    termination in the barbican, about 70 yards. It is of masonry with
    lateral parapets, and a roadway 10 feet 6 inches broad. Near its centre
    is a strong pier, or rather a tower, about 32 feet broad, angular below
    the roadway and rounded above. This tower is pierced by a passage, and
    is, in fact, a gate-house, having for its defence a battlemented floor
    above the gateway, which was reached by a narrow staircase contained in
    one of the piers. The corbels on which the battlements rested remain.
    From this tower there seem to have dropped two drawbridges, one each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
    way. That falling outward covered a pit 15 feet broad, now vaulted over
    as a permanent bridge. Its place is marked by an arch in the causeway,
    there about 20 feet high. The spandrel walls and parapets seem
    original, and the bridge worked between them, as was not uncommon, and
    may be seen at Goderich, and at the constable‚Äôs gate at Dover Castle.
    The second bridge dropped inwards towards the keep. Here the pit seems
    to have been a break in the causeway, not an archway through it. This
    bridge also has been replaced in masonry. Each of these drawbridges
    fell upon cills between small turret buttresses, no doubt intended to
    strengthen the approach, and to shelter two cross-bow men, who could
    retire over the bridge as the enemy advanced.</p>

  <p>The barbican, at the outer end or head of the causeway, is a mere shell
    of masonry of irregular shape. It occupies a knoll higher than the
    causeway, and has a rather steep approach from the town. The gateway
    opens between two half-round towers, beneath a pointed arch, recessed,
    but within an outer arch, above which is a projecting parapet, a sort
    of <i lang="fr">br√©tasche</i> in stone. There is no portcullis, and no trace of
    a drawbridge or outer ditch. The entrance to the causeway is 15 yards
    behind the great gate, through a hollow way, and the wall between them
    is looped with six openings looking towards the main ditch. In its rear
    the barbican rests upon the crest of the cliff, and has a mere parapet.
    It is prolonged 30 yards to the proper right of the gateway, which
    it thus flanks, and is strengthened in that direction by two small
    half-round turrets. In parts of the causeway are loops towards the main
    ditch, and a doorway, probably a postern, long walled up. The causeway
    and barbican are later than the keep and main curtain, and probably of
    the time of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, or rather later. They have been much altered
    and repaired, and no doubt played a part as outworks in the siege of
    1640.</p>

  <p>Outside of the natural ravine which forms the main ditch or moat,
    along the crest of its counterscarp, has been thrown up a bank of
    earth, probably masking the line of a palisade, intended to keep off
    skirmishers, and to guard against any attempt at scaling the main wall.</p>

  <p>The keep, though mutilated, is still the main feature of the castle. It
    is a rectangular tower about 56 feet square at the base and about 70
    feet high above the inner ward, and about 90 feet from the outer side,
    where the ground is some 20 feet lower. The walls are 11 feet thick,
    and of the same thickness to the summit. The west front and a few feet
    of its adjacent sides are gone, but the foundations remain, completing
    the square. The material is a sandstone of a deep red colour. The
    stones are about 2 feet to 2 feet 6 inches long and a foot high,
    nearly square, and laid with rather open joints. The interior seem to
    have contained a basement and three upper floors, but the basement is
    partially filled with earth, and its existence only indicated by a
    broken loop, seen about 16 feet from the ground on the north front. On
    the west and north or lower faces the keep has a bold battering base
    from 15 feet high to 8 feet or 10 feet. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>This was unnecessary on
    the other faces where the level of the soil is so much higher.</p>

    <div class="caption">SCARBOROUGH CASTLE.‚ÄîTHE KEEP‚ÄîSOUTH FACE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The east, the most perfect face, has the usual flanking pilaster
    strips, 10 feet 6 inches broad and of a foot projection, which rise
    unbroken to the summit, and no doubt supported the usual angular
    turrets, now removed. The angle at which the adjacent faces of the
    building meet is hollow, and is occupied by a bold round bead, 12
    inches diameter; in fact, a three-quarter shaft, but without base or
    capital. In the centre of the face is a third pilaster, 8 feet broad,
    and quite plain. On this side the basement floor has no openings. The
    ground, in fact, is above its level. The first and second floors are
    marked each by two round-headed recesses, 7 feet broad and a foot deep,
    the second contains a pair of narrow tall round-headed windows, having
    side columns, and in the centre a pair of coupled columns, common to
    both openings. The caps are fluted, and the window arches have a bold
    torus moulding, the only semblance of ornament throughout the building.
    The upper floor is marked by no recesses, but there are two pairs of
    small tall round-headed windows, with square jambs and architraves. The
    windows composing each pair stand about a foot apart. In the flanking
    pilasters are two pointed loops, corresponding to the second-floor
    level, and lighting mural chambers.</p>

  <p>The north face probably corresponded with that to the east, with the
    addition of two loops from the basement, one of which is now closed, as
    are the two windows above it. One flanking pilaster of this front is
    gone with its west end.</p>

  <p>Of the south face the west end is gone, but what remains is full of
    interest, as it shows how the entrance was arranged. The face is plain,
    without any regular pilasters or plinth. Towards its west end is the
    inner entrance, just beyond which the curtain-wall of the bailey sprang
    from the keep. This entrance is 7 feet broad, and the depth of the
    thickness of the wall. The passage is round-headed and ribbed. The
    inner doorway is round-headed, the outer face segmental. A flight of
    steps within the passage leads up to the floor of the first story. It
    is evident from a short pilaster, some springing stones, and certain
    other indications on the face of the wall, that the entrance was
    covered here by a small forebuilding. Against the face of the keep was
    built a rectangular block about 30 feet long and perhaps 20 feet broad,
    ending against and abutting upon the curtain. It contained a vaulted
    passage, and over its outer doorway, at its east end, was a large
    funnel-shaped machicolation for its defence. Within this the vault led
    on until on the right hand in the keep-wall was the inner entrance
    already mentioned. There was no portcullis, but above the doorway is
    an opening or <i lang="fr">meurtri√®re</i>, by means of which the entrance could
    be defended against those who might have forced the outer gate. The
    ramparts of the forebuilding were on the level of the second floor of
    the keep, and were reached from it by a small narrow doorway opening
    from a mural chamber in the south wall. Close east of this is another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
    small door, a little higher, the use of which is not very evident,
    unless it opened upon a hoard or <i lang="fr">br√©tasche</i> a little in advance
    of the stone parapet. A little west of and below these is a third
    and shorter doorway, which seems intended for the working of the
    <i lang="fr">meurtri√®re</i> over the inner door. It is connected with a small and
    very narrow mural staircase.</p>

  <p>The interior of the keep is not only filled up so as to hide the
    basement floor, but its eastern part has been converted into a powder
    magazine, and is inaccessible. It is said that the magazine includes
    four rectangular mural chambers, one 14 feet by 5 feet in the south
    wall, two 6 feet and 7 feet square, in the east wall, and one 5 feet
    by 6 feet in the north wall, but these have not been examined. The
    first floor was about 32 feet square, but divided into two nearly
    equal parts by a bold arch running north and south, and springing
    from two wall piers. The arch is gone, but the broken wall shows it
    to have been 4 feet 6 inches thick, and to have carried a solid wall,
    which divided the second and ceased at the floor of the upper storey.
    In the east wall of the first floor is a central fireplace of 7 feet
    opening with a round head and of no projection, round-backed, and with
    a vertical mural vent. On each side of it is a deep recess of 6 feet 9
    inches opening, round-headed, and containing a pair of coupled windows
    already described. There are two similar recesses in the north wall,
    one on each side of the cross arch, of which the eastern is at present
    walled up, but seems to have had besides its windows a small lateral
    door opening into a dark mural chamber, which occupied the north-east
    angle. The other recess, west of the cross wall, is open, and its two
    windows remain. In the south wall is a small doorway which leads into
    a mural chamber occupying the south-east angle, but now inaccessible.
    At the other end of this wall is the entrance door, and between it and
    the cross arch a steep narrow stair leading to the opening above the
    entrance doorway.</p>

  <p>At the second floor the cross-wall was pierced by a small doorway
    near its south end, of which one jamb remains. This floor also has a
    fireplace in its east wall, resembling that below, but with a segmental
    arch, while above it, in the wall, is a semicircular arch of relief. On
    either side is a recess with coupled round-headed windows, the shutter
    rebates of which are pointed. In the north wall are two doorways
    leading into mural chambers, and at its western end a recess and double
    window, as before. In the south wall are two openings; one, a door
    leading into a mural chamber in the south-east angle, lighted by a loop
    already mentioned, and the other a large recess within which are the
    two doorways opening towards the forebuilding. On the other side of
    the cross-wall, over the main door, are traces of a large recess with
    coupled windows.</p>

  <p>No fireplace remains in the upper floor, which seems to have been
    occupied by one large chamber, having in its east wall two pairs of
    coupled windows in deep round-headed recesses, and the same probably in
    its north and south walls. There may, indeed, have been a fireplace in
    the west wall.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp68" id="i_466">

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span></p>

  <p>The floors throughout seem to have been of timber. There are no traces
    of a mural staircase leading from one floor to another, but there may
    have been such in the north-west or south-west angles. Neither is there
    any mural gallery surrounding the building.</p>

  <p>It is in all respects unfortunate that Scarborough Castle is still
    regarded as a military post. Here, as at Dover, no one is allowed to
    sketch or measure within the area, although the force employed to see
    to the observance of this order renders it practically powerless.
    But the empty powder magazine is locked up, and effectually prevents
    a thorough examination of the keep; if this were removed, and the
    basement excavated, an absolutely correct plan of the keep might be
    obtained, which now is impracticable.</p>

  <p>A county that contains within its borders the castles of York and
    Richmond may yet be proud of the possession of Scarborough, which,
    though not superior to those, claims with them equal rank. No doubt
    the circumstances of each are different. The position of Richmond on
    the Swale, its ancient Norman keep, early and curious chapel, and the
    considerable remains of its hall and other domestic buildings, no less
    than the rank and warlike character of its earlier lords, have invested
    it with a peculiar and unrivalled interest. At York, the castle,
    spacious in area, and strong, if not striking in position, played no
    inconsiderable part in the Norman Conquest; and while surrounded with
    the works of the Romans and Romanized Britons, claims an origin from
    those of our Teutonic ancestors whose name is embodied in that of
    England. The claims of Scarborough to rank and fame are of a different
    though scarcely inferior character. Its position above the Northern
    Ocean is wild and grand in the extreme. Its area, defined and protected
    by Nature, is calculated to contain, not a garrison, but an army; and
    its keep, in itself equal to Richmond or most other Norman structures,
    is here not a citadel but the mere gateway and key to what is really
    the fortress, and which rises from the seashore above and behind it.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="SKENFRITH_CASTLE">SKENFRITH CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AMONG the numerous strong places in Monmouthshire, which, from
    their character and position, seem to have been thrown up during
    the occupation of that border territory by the Mercians and the
    English during the eighth and following centuries, Skenfrith holds a
    conspicuous place. Its fortune, moreover, was, to be adopted, like
    Caerleon and Grosmount, by the Norman invaders, who placed a keep upon
    its ancient, though inconsiderable, mound, and girdled its elevated
    platform with walls and towers of considerable strength,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span> so that it
    became of even greater importance in the twelfth and thirteenth than
    in the preceding centuries. It stands in the deep valley, and upon
    the bank of the Munnow, five miles below the castle of Grosmount, and
    six above that of Monmouth on the same river, besides which it forms
    the south-eastern point of the celebrated Monmouthshire trilateral,
    Grosmount and Whitecastle being the two others, so celebrated in Border
    warfare, and especially in the contest between Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> and the
    Mareschals, earls of Pembroke. Churchyard writes of them as,‚Äî</p>

  <div class="center-container">

        <div class="i0">Whose beauty gives the simple soyle some grace.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Unlike the elevated and rock-founded castles of Chepstow and Ludlow,
    the strength of Skenfrith was in the low and marshy character of
    its position. The Munnow flows within a few feet of its walls, and
    overflowed into its ample ditches, and a few yards below the castle
    is the bridge mentioned by Leland. Skenfrith marks the uniting point
    of several valleys, and even now, with the advantage of modern roads,
    is by no means easy of approach. Probably, in some measure on this
    account, it has suffered but little from additions or alterations,
    and as little from violence. Time, the greatest but least violent of
    revolutionists, has been the principal agent in the changes that have
    taken place, and the great obstacle to the study of the castle by the
    antiquary is the rich and redundant mantle of friendly ivy by which it
    is draped.</p>

  <p>Skenfrith belongs to that family of castles of which Coningsborough and
    Launceston are the English types, and of which Brunlais, and, in some
    degree, Tretower, are local examples. Its keep is a cylindrical tower,
    with a widening or battering base, to which the elder antiquaries
    gave the name of a Juliet. This stands within an inclosure formed of
    curtains and bastion towers, in this instance forming a trapezium in
    plan, of which the northern and southern sides are 74 yards and 71
    yards, and the eastern and western 31 yards and 59 yards. The diameters
    of the area, measured across the keep, are, northern and southern, 48
    yards, and eastern and western, 57 yards.</p>

  <p>The keep stands unconnected with the curtains, and nearly on the
    central line of the area, about ten yards from its eastern end. It
    crowns a low mound, about 6 feet high, and 50 feet broad at the top,
    evidently artificial. If the mound ever had a proper moat, it has been
    long filled up. The tower is now about 40 feet high, and may have been
    5 feet or 6 feet more. It is a cylinder of 36 feet in diameter, with
    walls 7 feet thick. Ten feet above the ground is a bold, half-round
    string or cordon, below which the wall batters, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span> at the base is
    10 feet thick, augmenting its diameter there to about 42 feet. The
    present entrance is to the west, by a doorway of 5 feet 6 inches
    opening, having an interior door opening inwards and probably having
    had an exterior door also, but the doorway is now a mere breach in
    the wall, with but a fragment of the rebate of its inner door. The
    masonry, and the absence of bar-holes, show this doorway not to be
    original. Probably it was opened in the Decorated period, when passive
    strength was less an object, and a first-floor entrance was found to
    be inconvenient. Such later openings are common in keeps with close
    basements. There is one at Pembroke.</p>

  <p>The basement chamber is circular, 22 feet 4 inches diameter, and its
    floor is at the ground level. In it are two loops, with flat tops, in
    recesses splayed to an opening of 3 feet, of which the cills are 3 feet
    from the ground. The wall is quite plain, and there is no trace of a
    well. This chamber was 11 feet high; no doubt, a store-room, and must
    have been entered from the chamber above by a ladder.</p>

  <p>The first floor, of the same diameter, was 14 feet high. This was the
    principal chamber. The floor was of planks resting upon four large
    beams laid across, the outer beams receiving the ends of some shorter
    timbers laid at right angles to them. The doorway points about west,
    and is partly over that of the basement. It was 5 feet broad, and its
    passage-vault was round-headed, but the ashlar dressings are gone.
    There is no trace of a portcullis. In the substance of the wall is a
    square hole, probably once containing an oaken tie, such as was used at
    Brunlais and at Rochester. This doorway was evidently the original and
    only entrance to the keep. To the right of the entrance a second door
    opened into a mural stair, a fragment of the cylindrical shell of which
    remains. This led to the second floor and battlements. For its support
    the external wall is thickened by a half-round buttress, solid below,
    and ascending to the summit. The door and the staircase are utterly
    ruined. In this floor are two window openings in flat-sided recesses,
    apparently round-headed. The windows, probably large loops, are broken
    away, and the ashlar face of the recesses is gone, but the relieving
    arch in the wall is flat pointed. Near the north recess is a corbel of
    Decorated aspect, 6 feet from the floor.</p>

  <p>The second story, entered by the winding mural stair, is much obscured
    by ivy. Its floor was of stout plank, resting upon a large single
    cross-beam, of which one support, a broad plain corbel, remains; the
    planks fitted into a rude groove or chase, not a set-off, in the
    wall, which is, therefore, not diminished in thickness. The curve of
    this story is a little impaired by a projection connected with the
    stair: and there is a sort of recess, which may have been the kitchen
    fireplace, the cooking being usually, in these towers, carried on in an
    upper floor, as at Castell Coch and Morlais. There were three windows
    in this floor, but of them little is to be seen, nor of what may
    remain of the ivy-covered battlements. The main floor was plastered,
    though thinly. It is evident that the floors were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span> always of timber.
    The main strength of a tower of this character was passive, the loops
    and windows counting for nothing in the defence, but no doubt the
    battlements had a rampart walk, and the roof, therefore, was either
    flat, or if conical, sprang, as at Coucy, Coningsburgh, Pembroke, and
    Marten‚Äôs Tower at Chepstow from an inner wall. Nothing can be more
    senseless than, as some modern architects have done, to cover these
    towers with a conical roof springing from the outer wall, which thus
    could not be defended in the only way possible with such structures,
    from above.</p>

  <p>The curtain wall of the single ward within which this Juliet keep is
    placed is 8 feet thick, and from 30 feet to 40 feet high, the contained
    area being at a level 6 feet to 10 feet above that outside, and no
    doubt raised artificially. The four angle towers were cylindrical,
    11 feet internal diameter, and with walls 8 feet thick. They have no
    internal projection, but the angle at each is crossed and filled up by
    a gorge wall, 7 feet long. Both towers and curtain have an exterior
    base about 12 feet high, battering below to a thickness of 10 feet, but
    without a cordon. Each tower is entered from the gorge by a door of 3
    feet opening, and its basement is elevated about 4 feet or 5 feet above
    the inner court. Each has three loops in recesses 4 feet 5 inches deep,
    and 5 feet 8 inches broad. There are no staircases, though there seem
    to have been two upper stories, the highest rising above the curtain.
    The floors were of timber. The arches vary; some are round-headed,
    others lancet, others drop-pointed. The loops are square-headed. The
    south-west tower has been taken down, and the present entrance to the
    place is through the gap.</p>

  <p>In the south front, 60 feet from the west end, is a half-round buttress
    tower, with no internal projection. The breaches in its interior and
    exterior faces show it to be solid. Opposite to this tower, in the
    north wall of the court, is a doorway of about 6 feet opening, the
    pointed arch of which is seen just at the level of the court. As the
    sill of this doorway must be at about the level of the Munnow, it was
    probably connected with a short canal for the admission of a boat, like
    what is seen at Tonbridge and Leeds Castles, and at Caerphilly. In this
    same wall, but close to the north-east tower, is a small, flat-sided
    recess, either a door or a window, and 6 feet above the court level. If
    a door, it must have been for the lifting of stores from a boat upon
    the mill-leat which flows below it.</p>

  <p>There is no trace of a regular gatehouse to this court, but a part of
    the centre of the west wall has been rebuilt in an inferior manner, and
    probably represents the entrance. This entrance was likely to have been
    by a mere doorway in the curtain without a regular gatehouse, like the
    lesser gateway at White Castle. From this point a slightly-elevated
    causeway, crossing the court, leads direct to the central tower.</p>

  <p>The walls are tolerably perfect, but the battlements have been removed,
    and the upper stages of the towers are in ruin. It is remarkable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
    that the mural towers are without staircases, and there are no visible
    mural chambers or garderobes, or, with one doubtful exception,
    fireplaces, in the castle. The material is the old red sandstone of the
    district, as was the ashlar. The workmanship is ordinary but pretty
    good rubble, and the mortar coarsely mixed and freely used. The mill
    leat, and the Munnow immediately beyond it, form the defences on the
    north front. Along the other three fronts was a broad and deep ditch
    fed from the river, and now filled up. As the ground within the walls
    is 6 feet to 10 feet higher than that immediately outside, they are to
    that extent revetments. It is pretty clear from the appearance that the
    original fortress was a raised platform, in its centre a mound, and
    around it a wet ditch, the whole, no doubt, strongly palisaded.</p>

  <p>There is nothing of a Norman character in either the plan or details
    of the structure. The singular form of the area may be but an
    accommodation in right lines to an irregular earthwork. Had it been
    Roman, the platform would scarcely have been raised. The keep tower is
    clearly early English of the time of King John, or early in that of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> The surrounding walls and towers are of the same date.</p>

  <p>The history of Skenfrith is obscure, but it is evident that it was
    built simply to contain a small garrison, and not at all as a private
    residence. The area contains no trace of hall, chapel, or kitchen. No
    lines of foundation are visible, and whatever lodgings were erected
    were probably of timber, with roofs resting against the wall.</p>

  <p>Skenfrith is said, at the entrance of the Normans into the district,
    to have been held by Bach, a son of Cadivor ap Gwaethvoed, which
    Gwaethvoed is the reputed ancestor of several families in Monmouthshire
    and East Glamorgan, and who, or his father, was likely enough to
    have obtained possession of it during the victorious campaign of
    Caradoc-ap-Griffith in 1065. The Pipe Roll of the first year of John
    shows the castles of Skenfrith, Llanteilo or White Castle, Kinton,
    and Ledbury, to have belonged to the king; and in 1205 (5 John) he
    granted Skenfrith, Llanteilo, and Grosmount to William de Breos, to
    hold them as they had been held by Hubert de Burgh, and Geoffrey,
    Earl of Essex, was allowed 20 marcs which he had paid to De Burgh for
    fortifying them. This probably was the date of the present masonry.
    John de Monmouth, a powerful local baron, had some claim upon these
    castles, which was admitted by the king; but nevertheless, in 1219, De
    Burgh was ordered to have seizin of the three castles forfeited by the
    defection of William de Breos. William‚Äôs heir was Reginald de Breos,
    who was in ill-health; he demurred to the decision of the king‚Äôs court.
    In 1220 they were held by De Burgh. In 1223 the king had occasion to
    send a messenger to Skenfrith, and in 1224 the Sheriff of Hereford was
    directed to send thither to De Burgh 2,000 quarrels (heads of cross-bow
    bolts), and all through the troubled reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> these castles
    continued to be of great military importance. At the settlement of
    Wales by his son they probably were allowed to fall to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span> ruin. With
    most of the surrounding property Skenfrith finally fell to the Duchy
    of Lancaster. As early as the time of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> it was presented by the
    local jury as ‚Äúruinous and decayed, time out of the memory of man.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The parish church, containing some fragments of early English or early
    Decorated date, stands a few yards west of the castle. It contains an
    altar tomb, bearing the effigies in a sort of trick of John Morgan,
    who died 2nd September, 1557, and Ann, his wife, who died 4th January,
    1564. On the side of the tomb are figures in relief. The armorial
    bearings are,‚Äîquarterly, 1 and 4, Barry of 9, on six escutcheons, 3,
    2, 1, as many lioncels rampant, 2 and 3, three towers, in the nombril
    point a roundel. Evidently these are the arms of Cecil, and point to
    the connexion claimed by that family with Wales. Another shield bears
    on a chevron three sprigs, between three spear-heads; crest, an arm
    embowed grasping a ‚Äî‚Äî. John Morgan is said to have been of Wayne, in
    this parish.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AT the head of the inlet known as Southampton Water, between its two
    principal tributaries of the Test or Anton and the Itchen, intervenes a
    considerable neck or tongue of gravel, which is thus bounded on three
    sides by water, and is a position of considerable natural strength,
    and the more valuable that it overlooks a fine roadstead, having the
    Isle of Wight for its breakwater. By whom this spot was first occupied
    is unknown. Bittern, an unquestionable Roman station, under the name
    of Clausentum, is nearly two miles farther up the Itchen, and upon the
    opposite bank. Even the origin of the present name of the town is a
    subject of dispute. The Anton presents a tempting source, but it seems
    most probable that the name means simply ‚Äúthe town of the southern
    dwelling,‚Äù as opposed to Northam, a place close to the Roman station.
    Certainly the name has no reference to Northampton.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúHamtunscire‚Äù is mentioned in the ‚ÄúSaxon Chronicle‚Äù in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
    755, and the town was a Saxon place of some mark, coining money in the
    reign of Athelstane, and occasionally plundered by the Danes. Canute
    held it, and his experiment upon the advancing tide is said to have
    been tried in Southampton Water.</p>

  <p>Southampton is named in Domesday, and the Normans found it a convenient
    port both for military and commercial purposes. It was visited and
    maintained by the Plantagenet monarchs, who here mustered and embarked
    their troops for Normandy. Hence the town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span> was fortified from an early
    period, both after the Saxon and the Norman fashion.</p>

  <p>The walls enclosed a roughly rectangular space, averaging about 370
    yards east and west, by 770 yards north and south, but in actual
    circuit about 2,200 yards, or 1¬º mile. This area is divided lengthways
    by the main street, but the western is the larger moiety, partly
    because it contains the older castle, and partly because of an
    irregular projection upon what is called the ‚Äútin shore.‚Äù The north
    and south gates were upon the main street. There was an east and a
    west gate, but not at all opposite to each other, nor were the roads
    cruciform. There is no reason for attributing to the moderately
    rectangular plan a Roman origin. It was probably dictated by the
    general figure of the ground.</p>

  <p>The surface of the area varies from 15 feet to 35 feet above the
    adjacent sea level. The northern half is higher than the southern, the
    western than the eastern. The highest ground, therefore, is in the
    north-west quarter, where was the castle.</p>

  <p>In consequence of this, the wall of this quarter, towards the west, is
    built against a scarped bank, and is a revetment 30 feet high, whereas
    elsewhere the wall is built upon ground nearly level, or at best
    not above 3 feet or 4 feet higher on the inner than the outer side.
    Besides the castle there is no considerable earthwork, and no reason,
    therefore, for attributing the defences of the town proper to a period
    earlier than the incoming of the Normans.</p>

  <p>The earthworks of the castle are, however, considerable. The naturally
    high ground was scarped and pared and somewhat raised, and near the
    centre of the area the highest point was surrounded by a circular
    ditch, the contents of which, thrown inward, converted the raised
    platform into an artificial mound. This, beyond doubt, was the Saxon fortress.</p>

  <p>The rectangular area was also well defended. It had the sea for its
    ditch nearly at the foot of the wall along the west and south fronts.
    Along the east a broad and deep ditch, wholly artificial, and in part,
    at least, admitting the sea, ran along the foot of the wall, and
    divided the town from a strip of lower land, which slopes towards the
    Itchen, and is now covered by an important suburb. Along the north
    front a ditch, also artificial, was cut across the ridge; it is said,
    to a depth allowing it to be filled from the sea. As this would involve
    a depth of about 40 feet, with a corresponding breadth, the tradition
    is probably an exaggeration.</p>

  <p>The north and east walls, least affected by any irregularities of
    ground, and nearly straight, are in length about 318 and 790 yards.
    The south and west fronts are curved and broken to suit the ground,
    and measure about 320 and 650 yards. The south-west angle is largely
    rounded off. Of recorded gates, there were the north or Bargate, still
    standing; the east gate, removed; the spur gate, remaining; the south,
    or water gate, removed; the west gate and the postern, preserved;
    Biddles, or Bridle Gate, gone; and the castle water gate, closed up.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span></p>

  <p>The mural towers were chiefly drum, or half round. The north front is
    flanked by two drum towers, and west of the Bar is one, and east of
    it two, half-round. Upon the east wall, north of the east gate, was
    one; and, south of it, six, of which one remains, half-round, and one
    rectangular. At the south-east angle, the south wall was prolonged
    eastwards as a spur-tower, covering the ditch; this remains. Upon the
    south wall there were six towers, including the south flank of the spur
    gatehouse, and, on the opposite flank, the Bugle Tower. All but one are
    half-round. The west wall had many buttresses, and few towers. There
    was one where the south wall of the castle joined the town wall; and
    near the north end is a fine half round tower,‚Äîan addition.</p>

  <p>Passing to the details, the north gate, called the Bar, is a large,
    handsome structure, about 60 feet broad by 60 feet deep in the centre.
    It is of two stages, pierced below by a central and two lateral
    passages, and contains above a chamber, 52 feet long by 21 feet broad,
    used for public purposes. In each wing is a staircase. That to the
    east is old, that on the west may have been so. The side passages
    are modern. They communicate with the central roadway by two cross
    arches on each side, of which the two next the north are original, and
    probably led into the flanking towers. An examination of the central
    passage shows the original gate to have been late Norman; at least a
    round-headed portal there placed is probably in that style, though
    it has rather a Decorated aspect. Then in the early Decorated time
    two bold half-round flanking towers were added, and still remain.
    At this time the rear was probably refaced, and four windows and a
    centre niche inserted, and the council-chamber enlarged, and probably
    the east staircase added. The Norman gatehouse had an upper room, of
    which a round-headed door, with a foliated head, remains. Next, in the
    Perpendicular period, a bold projection, three sides of an octagon, was
    added to the front. The gateway, thus advanced, is flanked by two bold,
    narrow buttresses, which run up to a very bold corbel table, having six
    machicolations in the central face, and three in each of the oblique
    lateral ones. The battlements are good Perpendicular, and carried round
    the rear towards the town; one embrasure is occupied by an alarm-bell.
    This gate has been much injured by restorations. The openings to the
    rear, archways and windows, have been refaced; but they preserve much
    of their old type, and have a Decorated aspect. The main passage has
    been cut away and widened, and the portcullis grooves are gone. When
    the ditch in front was filled up, a century ago, all trace of the
    drawbridge was lost. It appears that this bar was formerly a prison,
    and the curious cross arches were part of the arrangement for that
    purpose.</p>

  <p>West of the Bar much of the wall remains, but is so blocked in by
    houses as to be invisible. Forty-six yards from the gate is the site of
    a half-round tower, beyond which the wall extends in a straight line to
    Arundel Tower, so called from Sir John Arundel, an early governor. This
    is a drum, 22 feet in diameter, which caps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span> north-east angle of the
    town. This tower is 50 feet to 60 feet high, and seems to rise out of a
    rectangular mass of masonry, possibly added to strengthen it. Here the
    internal level is 30 feet, or more, above the external, being a part,
    no doubt, of the old earthworks.</p>

  <p>Continuing along the west wall, at 763 yards is a bold, half-round
    tower, 20 feet diameter, and 30 feet high, of excellent rough ashlar,
    with bold machicolations at the level of the adjacent curtain. This
    is Catchcold Tower. Built against the bank it looks solid, or like
    a bastion, but it is said to be hollow, though how entered does not
    appear. This tower, with the adjacent wall for some feet, is apparently
    a Perpendicular addition to what seems to be a Decorated wall. Beyond
    the tower is a flight of steps, modern, ascending 30 feet to the summit
    of the wall, which is there common to both town and castle. The wall
    then runs forward obliquely, probably to allow of the inclusion of the
    earthworks of the castle. It seems in substance Norman. The salient is
    capped by a rectangular buttress, the hollow angles of which on each
    side are crossed by low, pointed arches, pierced as garderobes, as at
    Porchester. This buttress tower is of Decorated date.</p>

  <p>Then follows about 134 yards of straight wall, probably Norman, about
    38 feet high, and backed to the summit with earth. Upon it a small
    rectangular buttress marks the junction of the north wall of the castle
    with the town-wall. Further on are five rectangular buttresses of
    various dimensions. The three first are evidently additions upon the
    Norman wall, the rest seem original. Part of the wall here is divided
    into two stages by a bold horizontal bead. Below are two narrow windows
    of about 18 inches opening, resembling large loops, and which seem to
    have had square heads. Above are traces of two windows, apparently
    round-topped. There must have been an interior chamber, now closed.
    The central buttress is broad and flat, and here are traces of the old
    water-gate of the castle, which must have been reached by steps, the
    ground behind being above 30 feet high. Close north of this water-gate
    is a large vaulted chamber, built against the town wall, and now
    closed. This part of the wall now ends in a rectangular projection,
    probably the root of a tower, and marked the junction of the castle
    south wall with the town wall.</p>

  <p>From hence the wall is low and thin for about 33 yards, marking the
    end of the castle ditch, and out of the regular line, having, no
    doubt, been rebuilt in modern times. On the rising ground of the
    castle counterscarp is the root of another square tower, marking the
    recommencement of the regular town wall, which then turns inwards so as
    to protect Biddles or Bridle Gate.</p>

  <p>This gate, now removed, opened into a steep and rather narrow ascent
    called Simnell-street, out of which, on the north side, opens
    Castle-lane, thought to represent an old entrance to the castle.</p>

  <p>At Biddles Gate commences a very curious part of the wall, which, as
    far south as a little beyond Blue Anchor postern, is unlike any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>thing
    known in England. The original wall, here about 30 feet high and 4
    feet thick, with the soil nearly level within and without, seems to
    have served not only for the town wall, but for the wall of several
    dwelling-houses within it, the doors and windows of which are visible
    in the wall, though now closed up. These openings show the wall to have
    been Norman, and of a moderately early period. This wall was not found
    sufficiently strong for the purpose of defence, and a second wall, also
    4 feet thick, was built against it on the outside. But this second wall
    was built like an aqueduct, as an arcade, upon tall and slender piers,
    about 2 feet 2 inches broad, from which, at 10 feet 6 inches high,
    spring arches mostly semicircular, but some pointed, and two very flat
    and probably much later, above which was the parapet. The arches are
    about 12 feet span. The result was to increase the rampart to a walk
    of 5 feet, with a parapet of 2 feet, and probably a rear wall of 1
    foot. Of course, an arcade so placed afforded great shelter for those
    attacking the wall from without; but to obviate this, while the piers
    touched the wall, a space like that for a portcullis, a chase about 2
    feet broad, was left between the arch and the wall, by means of which
    any one standing at the base of the wall could effectually be molested
    with missiles or a long pike. Eighteen arches of this arcade remain.
    The arrangement is a very curious one, and supposed to be singular.
    This masque or outer wall may be of late Norman date, but is possibly
    early English. The piers interfere much with the earlier doors and
    windows. The wall, where double, is 35 feet high. There are traces of
    some kind of building outside a part of the wall.</p>

  <p>A hole broken through the wall into Blue Anchor-yard shows the rear
    of the wall, and a little further south is Blue Anchor Postern, an
    original archway in the wall, much cut about and enlarged, but of which
    the portcullis chase, worked from the battlements, as at Fishergate,
    York, still remains. From the postern a very steep, winding narrow lane
    leads up into the town, between lines of ancient houses, of which two,
    one on each side, next the gate, are Norman. Both are curious, but that
    on the south side especially so. It is the shell of a Norman house,
    of the age of the older part of the wall. It is called, locally, King
    John‚Äôs Palace, but is, in truth, an ordinary Norman private house,
    and a fairly perfect one. The principal room was on the first floor.
    The roof is gone, but the door and windows remain. These are coupled,
    small, round-headed, and divided by a short column, with a slightly
    sculptured capital. The space within the walls is 43 feet by 45 feet.
    There is a good Norman fireplace, with hood and flanking columns. In
    the south and part of the east wall is a mural gallery. The house
    on the northern side of the lane is 44 feet by 15 feet. There is a
    good view of the town wall, and a plan of the two houses, in Parker‚Äôs
    ‚ÄúDomestic Architecture of the Twelfth Century,‚Äù <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 34.</p>

  <p>South of the postern the wall ceases to be double, and is all of one
    date, and about 6 feet thick. In this part is a flattish rectangular
    mural buttress tower, much blocked in with houses, but having its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
    south hollow angle crossed by a squinch arch carrying a garderobe. Near
    this is a high pointed doorway, evidently an insertion, of 24 feet
    opening, leading into Collis-court, and about 60 feet further is the
    west gatehouse.</p>

  <p>This is a perfect and plain rectangular gatehouse, 30 feet deep by 24
    feet broad, without buttresses, flush with the wall outside, and of
    bold projection within. It is pierced by a high pointed vault, of 12
    feet opening. The passage has been a good deal mutilated with a view to
    widening it. Near the centre was a good recessed doorway, the profile
    of the head of which is still traceable where it has been roughly
    cut from the wall. Between this and the inner face are two square
    portcullis grooves, and just within the inner entrance is a chase, 18
    inches broad, over the head of the arch. In the vault, in front of the
    central door-case, are nine holes, about 4 inches square, three in the
    crown line, and three along each haunch. These latter converge towards
    the central line.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse has a portcullis chamber on the first floor, and a second
    floor above this. An open stair against the south side leads to the
    battlement, from which a door, an insertion, opens into the portcullis
    chamber. These upper rooms are plastered and papered, and nothing can
    be seen in them.</p>

  <p>South of this gate the wall continues in a fairly perfect state for 80
    yards, and finally has been pulled down and removed. It may be traced
    as far as the site of a half-round tower, and some remains of an arch.
    Beyond this, also, the line of the wall may be traced as far as the
    site of Bugle Tower, 180 yards from the west gate, and which caps the
    south-west angle of the town.</p>

  <p>The south wall is almost wholly destroyed, and the foundation either
    removed or covered up by the broad and handsome quay which now
    intervenes between the base of the wall and the sea. This front was
    more or less convex, or rather polygonal, the angles being capped with
    drum towers. There are some traces of the south gatehouse. In the rear
    of this part of the wall are the site of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Magdalene‚Äôs Hospital,
    and in Porter Lane what was called Canute‚Äôs Palace. A representation of
    the south gate before 1784 is preserved by Grose. It had a low, broad
    Edwardian arch, with bold machicolations above, and toward the east it
    was protected by a long flanking wall, parallel to its approach. It was
    removed 1830‚Äì40.</p>

  <p>Forty yards from the south gate was another half-round tower, and
    thence the wall ran straight east for 83 yards, when it reached the
    south-east angle of the town. In the rear of this part of the wall, in
    Winkle-street, is ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs House,‚Äù a Norman church, now restored very
    badly, and converted into a French Protestant place of worship.</p>

  <p>At the south-east angle of the town, in the end of the east wall, is
    a gate, called God‚Äôs House Gate, or South Gate, but which should be
    called Spur Gate, as it opens upon a work of that class. This gatehouse
    is rectangular, quite plain, and without buttresses, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span> two upper
    floors. Its dimensions are 28 feet broad by 23 feet deep, and the south
    end projects as a low salient of two faces, upon the south wall, now
    removed. The passage is vaulted with a high pointed arch 12 feet broad.
    Like the west gate, it had a central recessed doorway, now much cut
    away, and two portcullis grooves. The vault in front of the door is
    supported by two, and in rear of it by three, cross-ribs. Altogether,
    in substance, this gatehouse resembles that of the west gate, and is
    of early Decorated date. Its front may have been rebuilt when the spur
    tower was added.</p>

  <p>The spur work projects from the northern flank of the entrance of the
    gatehouse for about 80 feet. It is composed of a sort of lofty gallery,
    or curtain, terminating in a rectangular tower, about 22 feet square,
    with buttresses capping the two east or outer angles diagonally. It
    is of three stories, and is built across the eastern ditch, no doubt
    to contain and protect its sluice communicating with the sea, which
    originally flowed up to the wall of the tower. There are seen large
    arches in the north and east faces, which look as though there had
    been a passage for boats; but these seem really to have been arches of
    construction only, intended to throw the weight of the building upon
    the corners, which probably are more deeply founded than the curtain.
    In the north face is also a large modern arch, a relic of the canal
    which was to have been carried beneath the tower. The spur-work and
    the gatehouse were long used as a Bridewell. All still bear marks of
    that degrading occupation. The whole spur-work is good Perpendicular.
    Leland calls this the south gate, and the spur tower the Castellet.
    Grose gives a view of it about 1770. From the Spur Gate the town wall
    is tolerably perfect as far as the first half-round tower, 60 yards.
    From hence the wall may be traced 35 yards to a flat buttress, 14 feet
    broad and 3 feet deep, of which there are some remains. Beyond this, at
    37 yards, is the site of a rectangular tower, 30 feet broad and 24 feet
    deep These two are said to be additions of the time of Edward <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr> They
    look much older.</p>

  <p>From hence to the north-east angle of the tower the wall has been
    pulled down, but its line may be traced, partly by occasional
    foundations, partly by its materials which have been used in the houses
    built on its site, and partly by the direction of the lane called ‚ÄúBack
    o‚Äô the Wall,‚Äù which runs along its rear, and by the parallel road which
    runs along the counterscarp of the ditch, and is called ‚ÄúCanal Walk,‚Äù
    from an abortive canal which was carried along the line of the ditch at
    the commencement of the present century.</p>

  <p>The east gate spanned East-street, and was taken down in 1772. Grose
    gives a drawing of it, and attributes its erection to the year 1339, 13
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Between this gate and the north-east angle was one mural
    half-round tower.</p>

  <p>Of Polnymond Tower, which caps the north-east angle, there are
    considerable remains. It is a three-quarter drum tower, about 28 feet
    diameter. From it to the bar, 160 yards, the wall, or part of it,
    remains, but so clustered with buildings as to be inaccessible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span> to
    ordinary visitors. Here are remains of two half-round towers, and a
    breach in the wall, called York Gate, probably representing a postern.</p>

  <p>The east ditch is marked by a depression, in part due to the canal. The
    north ditch is completely obliterated and built over, and its breadth
    is not recorded, and has not been ascertained by probing. If Hanover
    Buildings mark its counterscarp, it was 46 yards broad; but if, as is
    much more probable, its limit is marked by Cold Harbour, it was only 24
    yards, which tallies with that along the east front.</p>

  <h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>

  <p>The castle was very probably the oldest, and perhaps the only
    pr√¶-Norman fortification connected with the town. It occupied nearly
    the whole of the north-western quarter of the walled area, and included
    also the highest ground. In plan it was a rough semicircle, the chord
    of 124 yards being the town wall, and the arc measuring about 300
    yards. There is, however, also a considerable knoll, on the south-east
    of the area, of about 45 yards diameter, about half of which lay
    outside the curved <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>.</p>

  <p>This was the keep. Leland calls it the dungeon (donjon), and the ‚Äúglory
    of the castle.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúboth large, fair, and very strong,
    both by works and by the site of it;‚Äù and other writers describe it as
    a lofty mound. As usual, in forming such works, advantage was taken
    of high ground to make it the base of an artificial mound encircled
    by a deep and broad ditch. The keep, no doubt a shell of masonry like
    Arundel, towered above the rest of the works. Of the curved wall of
    the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> a part remains to the north. It was built on
    piers about 8 feet square and 9 feet apart, a round-headed arch with
    a tendency to a point connecting these. The tops of these arches were
    about 12 feet above the base of the piers, and upon them rested a wall,
    which carried the battlement. The arches were buried in a bank of
    earth about 15 feet high. This bank has been removed to allow houses
    to be built up to the wall, which now, therefore, stands like a Roman
    aqueduct. The foundation is excellent, so that this plan was adopted
    solely to save material and to profit by the older bank. The roughness
    of the masonry shows the height of the bank, above which the remaining
    wall rises about 4 feet. It is much to be regretted that this curious
    piece of Norman wall has been so badly treated. About 90 yards of it
    remain, including eighteen arches. It stops at the Castle-lane, where
    was the main gate of the castle, removed at the end of the last century.</p>

  <p>The wall, beyond the gate, was continued up the mound to the keep, and
    beyond it till it reached the southern gate, whence it was continued
    till it again struck the town wall. Thus the keep was upon and formed
    part of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, as was usual. From the south gate, also
    removed in the last century, a winding road, commenced from the wall,
    led down to Simnell-street, a few yards within the postern.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span></p>

  <p>Near the castle, against and within the town wall, is a large
    subterranean vault, now closed; and, judging from the openings in the
    wall, there was a corresponding vault to the south of this.</p>

  <p>The whole area of the castle is high, and much of it has been still
    higher, the mound having been lowered, the ditch partially filled up,
    and the bank along which the wall was built having been removed.</p>

  <p>To judge from the material evidence afforded by an inspection of the
    works, it would appear that the castle represents the Saxon or Danish
    earthwork, probably the earliest strong place, and was composed of a
    truncated mound, its circular ditch, and a bank of earth encircling an
    area, of which the mound or a moiety of it made part: the whole forming
    a burh of the first class.</p>

  <p>The Normans, probably in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, enclosed the castle
    and town in a rectangular wall, and dug the east and north ditches.
    Also the castle was enclosed with a wall built in part on arches, and
    a shell keep placed on the flat summit of the mound. The wall of the
    castle, and much of the west wall of the town, and the two houses in
    Blue Anchor-lane, may be attributed to this period.</p>

  <p>Then it became necessary to strengthen the town wall, and this was
    probably done in the reign of King John, who, it appears, remitted to
    the citizens ¬£200 out of their fee-farm rents for the enclosure of
    their town and the thickening of the wall, and perhaps the west and
    spur gates were begun at that time.</p>

  <p>Much must have been done to the fortifications during the reign of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> To this date are probably due the older drum
    towers and much of the wall connected with them, and the recessing of
    the Bargate and the addition of its flanking towers.</p>

  <p>It appears that the town was attacked by pirates and sacked in October,
    1338, 12 Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and in consequence it was strengthened in the
    next year. The south and east gates may have been of this date, and the
    spur tower and its gallery, unless this latter be, with the completion
    of the Bargate, the work of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> This king seems to have done
    much to the castle.</p>

  <p>The vault indicated on the plan as on the north side of the water-gate
    is at present wholly underground, being built against and within the
    exterior wall, its floor being about the level of the footing of the
    wall. The vault measures 55 feet 3 inches north and south, by 19 feet
    6 inches east and west, and is about 25 feet high. Sir H. Englefield
    says it has much the air of a chapel. Others call it a guard-room to
    the water-gate. A chapel would scarcely have stood north and south, and
    a guard-room, especially so large a one, however necessary for a main
    gate, would be quite out of place beside a mere postern. The vault was
    entered a few weeks ago through a long closed-up opening in the west
    wall, but the writer has been unable to learn what was then observed.</p>

  <p>To the south of the water-gate is, or was, a similar vault, indi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>cated
    by the openings in the wall, one 3 feet and one 1 foot from the ground,
    both long since built up. Probably these two were the substructures of
    two buildings which formed a part of the exterior wall, and were used
    for stores or cellars.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to speak too highly of the large scale plan of
    Southampton executed under Sir H. James, upon which the lines of the
    old wall, and position of other objects of antiquity, are shown in a
    manner which leaves nothing to be desired.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="TAMWORTH_CASTLE_WARWICKSHIRE">TAMWORTH CASTLE, WARWICKSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TAMWORTH CASTLE stands at the confluence of the Anker with the Tame, on
    the right bank of either, between the town and the latter river, and
    close above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs Bridge. It occupies a position near the east end
    of the south, or river front, of the old town, the outlines of which
    are still indicated by a bank and ditch, showing it to have been in
    plan a parallelogram, with one side resting upon the Tame, and the east
    end defended by the Anker. The low ground about the junction of the
    rivers, the broad meadows on the left bank of the Tame opposite to, and
    on both banks below the town, in their natural condition a deep morass,
    must have rendered the place nearly inaccessible upon its east, south,
    and west fronts; and, no doubt, led to its conversion into a safe
    residence at a very early period.</p>

  <p>As the ground rises from the river, the town and its grand old church
    occupy positions rather higher than the castle, and which must always
    have been dry and airy and, in consequence, salubrious.</p>

  <p>The line of the town defence upon the east side is known as the King‚Äôs
    Ditch, in reference, it is supposed, to the Mercian Offa. Though
    without anything like sharpness of outline, and occupied as a nursery
    garden, the work is by no means obliterated, and may be traced nearly
    from the Anker below Bolebridge for about 300 yards northwards. It
    is composed of a raised bank, which formed a terrace behind the wall
    or palisade, a ditch more or less filled up, and beyond this a slope
    representing a glacis, or space outside the works, which it was the
    custom from a very early period to keep clear of cover. Bank and ditch
    are about 45 feet broad. The Market-street intersects the line of
    defence, and, being old, probably was crossed by a gatehouse. There
    are some slight and uncertain traces of masonry upon its north side.
    Further north, a modern road affords a good section of the bank.</p>

  <p>This side joins the north front at a right angle, within which is a
    sort of tump, remembered as somewhat larger, and which looks as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span> it
    marked the site of a mural tower, or perhaps a cavalier or small mount.</p>

  <p>The defences of the north front skirt the Lichfield and Polesworth
    road, and are traceable nearly to the cross-road from Seckington.
    Beyond this, the line, now built over or enclosed in walled gardens,
    was traced by Dugdale along a front altogether of 400 paces, to a mount
    marking the north-west corner, from which the line passed at right
    angles southwards to the river. This would give a space of about 300
    yards by 400 yards as the enclosure of the town. Outside the west front
    the ground sinks rapidly into the meadows, among which, on the river
    bank, and just outside the town, is the Moat House, an old seat of the
    Comberfords, still standing in all its dampness, although the moat has
    been filled up.</p>

  <p>The principal bridge, that across the Tame, close below the castle,
    known as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs or Lady Bridge, is of modern construction. It
    succeeded a medi√¶val structure, shown in Shaw‚Äôs plate of 1780, the
    precursor of which was probably a bridge, or perhaps a ford, of Saxon
    times. In Leland‚Äôs day, a stone upon it bore the arms of Lord Basset,
    of Drayton.</p>

  <p>Bow, or Bolebridge, crosses the Anker, and leads to the hamlet of
    Bolehill and to Nuneaton.</p>

  <p>The church is a large structure of considerable merit, containing some
    Norman work, apparently once connected with a central tower, and in
    which may be seen traces of herring-bone masonry. East of it are some
    ruins, known as the Deanery, part of which seems also to be Norman. The
    Market-place, though much altered, represents an early space set aside
    for trading purposes.</p>

  <p>Tamworth has no historical pretensions to either British or Roman
    origin. The Britons would have designated it from the smaller stream.
    The earliest mention of it is in the records of the people in whose
    tongue it is named. Offa, King of Mercia, in a charter of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
    781, announces himself as ‚Äú<span lang="la">Ego Offa rex, sedens in regali palatio in
    Tamoworthige</span>,‚Äù an evidence of its distinction at that time, and one
    which renders it probable that it had an earlier history. Cenwulf
    dates a charter of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 816, ‚Äú<span lang="la">In vico celeberrimo qui vocatur
    Tomoworthig</span>,‚Äù and other royal charters are dated from it in 841 and
    854. So that in the eighth and ninth centuries it was already a royal
    residence and a place of celebrity.</p>

  <p>The Danes ravaged it in common with much of Mercia early in the tenth
    century, and in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 913‚Äì14 it was restored by √Üthelflaed,</p>

  <p class="noindent">daughter of Alfred, sister of Edward the Elder, and the foundress of
    Tutbury, Warwick, and many other well-known Saxon places of strength.
    She is reputed to have cast up the mound, and to have placed her
    residence on the summit. She died here <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 918‚Äì22.</p>

  <p>The castle and half the town are in the shire of Warwick; the other
    half and the church in Stafford. There is no mention of the castle in
    Domesday.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span></p>

  <p>At the Conquest, Tamworth became the property of Robert Marmion, who
    seems to have fortified it, as such earthworks were fortified in
    Normandy, and to have made it strong enough to be obnoxious, some
    time later, to King John, who, in 1215‚Äì16, ordered it to be razed.
    Under Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> another Robert was its lord, and Philip Marmion died
    seized of it in 1291‚Äì92. From Marmion it descended to Frevile, thence
    to Ferrers, thence with Ann Ferrers, at the end of the seventeenth
    century, it came in marriage to the house of Shirley, from whom,
    through Compton, it passed to the Townshends, whose representative,
    Marquis Townshend, is sixteenth Baron Ferrers by writ of 1299, and
    owner of Tamworth Castle, while Earl Ferrers, the male heir of the
    Shirleys, is Viscount Tamworth, by creation in 1711.</p>

  <p>From the Norman Conquest to 20 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, the castle descended through
    five generations of Marmions; from thence to 7 Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>, through six of
    the house of Frevile, and from thence to 1680 through eleven descents
    of the name of Ferrers; being twenty-two lords from the Conquest to
    1680. King James and Prince Charles lodged here in 1619.</p>

  <p>The castle is composed of a mound, a platform, buildings upon the
    mound, a curtain-wall ascending it, and the remains of a gatehouse.</p>

  <p>The mound is wholly artificial, about 50 feet high, circular, and about
    100 feet diameter at its flat summit. Its sides stand at the natural
    slope of mixed dry earth and gravel, the <i lang="fr">d√©bris</i> of the new red
    sandstone of the district; and its base may be about 12 feet above the
    river.</p>

  <p>South-east of the mound is a triangular platform, also more or less
    artificial, and raised about 15 feet above the river. One side is
    straight, and fronts the water. That to the east is at present a hollow
    curve, and has evidently been retained by a wall against which it
    formed a terrace. This side extends northwards to the ruined gatehouse,
    indications upon which seem to show that part of the platform has been
    removed, and that it originally extended a few yards eastwards into the
    present brewery; so that this front was, no doubt, straight, and not,
    as now, concave.</p>

  <p>The third side, or hypothenuse, of the platform lies towards and partly
    encircles the mound, and is therefore concave; and between the two is a
    ditch. Excepting this ‚Äúvalley of elevation,‚Äù there is no present trace
    of a ditch at the foot of the mound.</p>

  <p>Below the south front, between it and the Tame, and close above <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
    Mary‚Äôs Bridge, is the castle mill, rebuilt in modern times. It is
    worked by the Anker, which, sweeping round the south-east front of the
    castle, serves as a mill leat. Above the mill, and between the leat and
    the line of wall, is a narrow strip of land, now a garden, and probably
    once a pasture beneath the castle wall.</p>

  <p>North of the platform a curtain wall runs from the gatehouse up the
    mound, with the summit of which its top is level. This wall in plan is
    angular, or slightly convex, towards the exterior or town side. It is
    10 feet thick, and has a rampart wall of 7 feet, a parapet of 2 feet,
    and a rere wall of 1 foot. The rampart walk or allure was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span> probably
    the only way from the gatehouse to the top of the mound. It rises
    gently, but has no steps. It is about 20 feet high at the central part,
    ending and commencing at nothing. It is of herring bone masonry, of
    flat stones laid obliquely on edge, each course being separated by a
    horizontal bed, sometimes single, sometimes double, of small stones,
    resembling flat pebbles. At the deepest there are twenty-one courses.
    Here and there the surface has been patched, but on the whole the
    wall is in its original state, very rough, but perfect. The joints
    are very open. The exterior face is less perfect, and is, besides,
    concealed by clumsy buttresses, perhaps of Tudor or earlier date. The
    herring-bone structure is not seen in the rere wall, which is probably
    a restoration, but it appears in the front parapet for a foot or two
    above the rampart walk. This is a very remarkable wall, and should be
    photographed in detail.</p>

  <p>The continuation of the wall to the upper lodge or gatehouse from the
    town is in part old, but of later date than the curtain. The gatehouse
    itself is chiefly modern, but part is old; and connected with it are
    the remains of an arch jamb and portcullis groove, probably traces of
    the main entrance to the castle. This gate leads by a short lane into
    the market-place. The lower lodge, or entrance from the bridge side,
    was built in 1810, and with its adjacent wall is wholly of that date.</p>

  <p>The mound is crested by a many-sided shell of wall, about 9 feet thick,
    and from 30 feet to 40 feet high. This wall is in part very old. The
    base has been supported by a modern facing, which batters considerably,
    and is about 2 feet high; but above this, for 6 feet or 8 feet, the
    workmanship is open-jointed rubble, with stones of large but irregular
    size and shape. The quoins are, however, of ashlar, rude but sound.
    Above this to the rampart height, the wall seems to have been rebuilt
    in early times in a better manner, but as though the old work had been
    left where sound, so that the two run much into one another.</p>

  <p>The upper 10 feet of the wall, all parapet, seems of still later date.
    It is crenellated, and occasionally looped at the rampart level. At
    the south-west quarter is a loop about 6 feet from the ground, and two
    others higher up, all which are apparently of the age of the wall,
    and being near the well probably lighted the offices. This wall is
    much obscured by ivy. It has been materially altered at two points; on
    the south side entirely rebuilt for several yards to form the outer
    wall of the southern private apartments; and on the opposite side by
    the insertion at the same time of several large late Tudor windows,
    to light the northern apartments. Under these latter are three heavy
    masses of stone-work to support balconies. One is of somewhat earlier
    date and of better design than the others.</p>

  <p>In the circuit of the wall, to the south, and commanding the way up the
    curtain, is a tower 24 feet square, and having 5 feet projection from
    the wall. Its angles within are plain, but those without are flanked by
    two narrow pilaster strips, leaving a free angle between them. These
    strips rise about 20 feet, and clumsily pass into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span> a sort of octagon,
    which at the top of the tower becomes a cylinder, and is so seen on the
    battlements. These, however, may be an alteration. The tower is about
    40 feet high, and the walls are 7 feet thick. It somewhat batters.
    On its exterior face are two Tudor windows; and about half-way up a
    string-course, stopped by the pilasters, which in the centre rises as a
    half-round drip, probably once heading a Norman window. This tower is
    of rubble, of the date of the wall, with ashlar pilasters. In its outer
    wall is a very serious crack, which seems to be getting worse.</p>

  <p>A few feet south of the tower, and therefore close to the curtain
    ascent, is the doorway into the keep. This is of small size, with an
    equilateral arch, plain square jambs continued up through the arch
    moulding, which is very plain, the angle only being rounded off. The
    drip, if one there was, has mouldered away. This doorway traverses the
    wall rather obliquely. The inner front has a ribbed head, and two faces
    carved upon it near the springing. There is neither portcullis groove
    nor large bar hole. The defence was a single door.</p>

  <p>Between the door and the tower a sort of oriel has been corbelled out
    at an early period, possibly to defend the approach. At present it has
    a loop in its basement, and two Tudor windows above, and is surmounted
    by a small gable of the same date.</p>

  <p>Round the base of the wall is a terrace, about 10 feet wide and 8 feet
    high, above the slope of the mound. The retaining wall is in part old,
    and is supported by short stout buttresses, apparently of Decorated
    date. This wall has been patched, and in places rebuilt, in Tudor and
    later times, and its low circumscribing parapet is mostly modern. What
    it was, or when constructed, is uncertain. It may have carried a low
    parapet, a sort of chemisette, defending the base of the keep wall, and
    intended to supplement the ditch at the foot of the mound. In the last
    century it was crossed on the south side by a wall, with a gate in it,
    but this probably was not original.</p>

  <p>The buildings within the shell are next to be described. The entrance
    lies beneath a sort of gatehouse, of the date of the other buildings,
    having on the right the tower court, and on the left a small court
    having the outer wall for one of its sides, and in that wall a small
    doorway, whence a mural staircase ascends, winding with the wall, to
    the battlements. The inner entrance, opening to the private apartments
    and hall, is a rather elaborate doorway of the style of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> This
    opens into a passage or lobby, having on the right the great hall, on
    the left a buttery, or modern housekeeper‚Äôs room, and in front the way
    to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The hall lies north and south, and occupies nearly the centre of the
    enclosure. At each end of it are distinct suites of apartments, having
    no direct communication save through the hall. On its east side is the
    tower and tower-court; on its west side the kitchen and kitchen-court.</p>

  <p>The hall is 40 feet by 20 feet, the end of honour being the north. The
    entrance-door is on the middle of the south end. The north<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span> end is
    blank. Of the east side, about the south half is occupied by a large
    oak window-frame, with square apertures, glazed, reaching from about 5
    feet high to the eaves of the roof, and looking into the tower-court.
    In the same side at the north end a door leads by a stair to the
    northern apartments and the tower. On the west side, in the centre, is
    a large fireplace; to its north a window similar to the other, but
    rather smaller; and to its south a door, opening on a stair, leading to
    the southern apartments.</p>

  <p>The roof of the hall is of open-work, supported by two detached and two
    engaged principals, one against each gable. The stone floor has lately
    been replaced by boarding. The three doorways are round-headed, of the
    age of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> The aspect of the hall is gloomy, the roof heavy and
    unskilful, the windows unpleasing, and the walls thin and of brick.
    There are here four good wrought-iron candelabra about 6 feet high.</p>

  <p>The southern apartments upon the basement are, with the exception
    mentioned, private. On the first floor are the library and
    drawing-room, and one or two private rooms. The library is panelled
    with oak to the cornice, and along the upper tier of panels are painted
    Ferrers and his matches. The fireplace is very handsome, and above
    it is a large atchievement, carved in black oak, of Ferrers and his
    quarterings, crest, supporters, and motto. The drawing-room, also
    panelled and larger, has a good fireplace. Each room has a large Tudor
    window to the south, and is exceedingly cheerful. The second floor is
    not shown.</p>

  <p>The northern apartments lie between the hall and the north wall, in
    which the windows are pierced. The basement is composed of cellars, on
    the ground level, opening from the tower and kitchen courts. The first
    floor contains a large drawing-room and two smaller lateral rooms. All
    are dismantled, stripped of the panelling, and in a state of decay. The
    second floor contains bedrooms, also disused. From this floor a door
    opens upon the rampart of the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall, where it is seen to
    be 7 feet thick, and to have a parapet about 10 feet high. Below is the
    kitchen-court, and against the wall may be seen a sloping water table
    marking a roof, probably of an early kitchen. At the other end these
    rooms communicate with the tower, the floors of which are ruinous. The
    tower basement is entered from the court. The stairs throughout are in
    rectangular staircases, and each step is a heavy log of oak.</p>

  <p>Between the hall and the west wall is the kitchen, fitted up with a
    modern roof and appliances, but, no doubt, on an old site. At one
    end of it is the well, about 5 feet diameter, lined with ashlar,
    and descending to the level of the river. At the other end is the
    kitchen-court, in which is seen a closed doorway leading into the
    basement of the northern apartments. It may be of Decorated or early
    Perpendicular date.</p>

  <p>Looking to the rectangular and oblong outline of the defences, the
    cross-roads, and the position with one open side upon a river, it is
    difficult not to regard Tamworth as of Roman origin, or as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span> modelled by
    Roman occupation. The Icknield-street, in its course from Birmingham
    towards Lichfield, passes, it is true, no nearer to Tamworth than
    Wall, the ancient Etocetum, six miles distant, where it is crossed
    by the Watling-street; but this latter, in its course to Atherstone
    or Mancetter, passes through Fazeley, only a mile south of Tamworth;
    and had it not been for its considerable angle at Wall, it would
    have passed directly through the town. Nevertheless, Roman towns are
    generally indicated by history or tradition, or the remains of Roman
    masonry, or articles of domestic use, and these evidences appear here
    to be entirely wanting.</p>

  <p>But whatever may be the origin of the rectangular bank and ditch,
    there can be very little doubt but that the mound and platform of the
    castle were the works of √Üthelflaed or her Saxon predecessors, the one
    to support the usual timber stronghold of the Saxon thanes, the other
    for the huts and sheds of their retainers and their cattle. Probably
    a ditch included both mound and platform on the three landward sides,
    and both these and the river front were strengthened by a palisade.
    As no mention is made of the town walls, no doubt a similar defence
    crested the bank all round. This is the arrangement well known to have
    been usual, both in Normandy and England, in the centuries preceding
    the Conquest, and a good and much earlier local example of it was given
    by the Romans at Wall, where a few years since the palisades were
    discovered preserved in a morass which formed their defence in front.</p>

  <p>The Normans seem to have begun by building the enclosing wall, the
    remaining part of which is certainly Norman, probably early, and older
    than the keep. The domestic buildings were probably at first below the
    court at the foot of the mound; afterwards the keep seems to have been
    filled up by buildings. The main entrance was evidently by the upper
    gatehouse from the town.</p>

  <p>The curtain wall cannot be much later than the Conquest. It is clear
    that it never was prolonged across the top of the mound, as the slope
    of its rampart walk only points to the level of the top; probably,
    therefore, when it was built there was a structure of some sort upon
    the mound. It is also uncertain whether the curtain recommenced on the
    opposite slope of the mound, and was continued down by the present
    lodge towards the mill, in which case the area of the castle would have
    been about 100 yards across.</p>

  <p>The present shell, upon the mound, seems later than the curtain. The
    entrance door and the middle band of the wall seem additions of one
    age, perhaps of the reign of John or Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> The terrace and the
    oldest parts of the interior are probably later, perhaps of the time of
    Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> or <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr></p>

  <p>Leland, writing in the reign of Henry <abbr title="8th">VIII.</abbr>, says, ‚ÄúThe castle of
    Tamworth standeth on a meetly high ground, at the south part of the
    towne, hard upon the ripe of Anker, at the mouth of it. The base court
    and great ward of the castle is clean decayed, and the wall fallen
    down, and therein be now but houses of office of no notable building.
    The Dungeon hill yet standeth, and a great round tower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span> of stone,
    wherein Mr. Ferrers dwelleth and now repaireth it.... The town of
    Tamworth is all builded of timber.‚Äù‚Äî[<abbr title="Itinerary">Itin.</abbr> <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> 122.]</p>

  <p>The base court evidently was the platform, and the great ward no doubt
    included all the ground south of the present curtain, and between the
    mound and the mill.</p>

  <p>In the east window of the church was a painting, of which a copy is
    preserved by Dugdale. It represents the Conqueror enfeoffing Robert
    Marmion with the castle. The king stands in front of a considerable
    building, fronted by two drum towers of two stories, with conical
    roofs, and connected by a curtain. In one tower is a gateway, and
    behind the two are seen, in perspective, the stepped gable of a hall,
    and the chisel-pointed roof of a rectangular tower.</p>

  <p>On the proper right of the king and of the building, in the distance,
    is the mound, crowned with a wall. This is, no doubt, a representation,
    rather exaggerated, of the castle, as it stood in the later Plantagenet
    times.</p>

  <p>Dugdale, writing after the civil wars, says, ‚ÄúThe Norman castle stood
    below, towards the mercate-place, where the stables now are.‚Äù The
    mercate-house, rebuilt in Queen Anne‚Äôs days, remains; the stables are
    removed to the other side, towards the bridge. The Norman castle means
    the domestic buildings.</p>

  <p>13 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Philip Marmion had made a certain ‚Äú<span lang="la">pour presture</span>,‚Äù or
    encroachment, to the injury of the king‚Äôs market, on either side of
    Tamworth Castle, containing a width of 8 feet and a length of 40 feet.</p>

  <p>The Mr. Ferrers whom Leland mentions was probably Sir John Ferrers
    (died 1576), who married Barbara Cockaigne; and the domestic buildings
    now standing were his work, and, perhaps, the work of his son and grandson.</p>

  <p>What originally stood within the shell is unknown, probably some
    lean-to houses of early English and Decorated date, which were removed,
    or nearly so, for the present structures. These latest works are mainly
    of brick, with freestone dressings and door casings.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="TAUNTON_CASTLE">TAUNTON CASTLE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TAUNTON CASTLE possesses an interest in the eyes of arch√¶ologists which
    its present appearance and its Norman history may not seem to justify,
    but which depends upon the fact that it is of English and not Norman
    foundation, that it dates from a period nearly two centuries earlier
    than any other fortress mentioned in the Saxon Chronicle, and not only
    is the date of its construction approximatively known, but its existing
    earthworks, though mutilated, are beyond question original.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span></p>

  <p>The castle stands upon one of the many low hummocks of gravel, often
    with a base of red marl, which rise out of the extensive fen lands of
    this very singular district, and which, before agriculture had drained
    the marshes, were even more inaccessible (in military phrase were
    stronger ground), than even the hill fortresses of the upper country.
    The Thone, the river whence the town derives its name, rises by many
    and copious tributaries over a wide sweep of country, north, west, and
    south, and traversing the low land, which though neither so wet nor
    so extensive as many of the adjacent levels, was yet broad enough and
    marshy enough to serve every purpose of defence.</p>

  <p>Here, upon the right bank of the stream, Ine, the celebrated leader and
    lawgiver of the West Saxons, is reputed to have established himself
    in the year 702, while engaged in securing his frontier against the
    western Britons, who, under the leading of Geraint, still maintained a
    footing in the broken ground east of the Tamar, upon Exmoor and among
    the Brendon and Quantock Hills, holding probably the camps which still
    remain, but little altered by the lapse of a thousand or eleven hundred
    years.</p>

  <p>This seems to be the origin of the town of Taunton, and here, upon the
    edge of one of the inosculating branches of the sluggish stream, Ine
    founded his castle by throwing up banks of earth girdled with deep and
    formidable ditches, and no doubt further strengthened by stockades of
    timber, or at best by walls the workmanship of which scarcely deserved
    the name of masonry. Such as it was it was destroyed, that is, burned,
    by Queen √Üthelburh in 722, who probably however left the earthworks,
    the better part of the defence, much as she found them.</p>

  <p>The spot selected, resting upon the river, is covered by a loop, which
    has been converted into a mill stream, working a mill placed a little
    below the castle. This river or north front is tolerably straight and
    about 180 yards long. The west front, about 168 yards, is formed by
    what seems to have been a tributary stream called the Potwater, which
    here joined the river nearly at a right angle. The south and east
    fronts, of 340 yards, were formed by a curved watercourse, probably
    artificial, which connected the tributary, by a second junction, with
    the river, and thus completed the circuit of the defence. The enclosure
    was thus a sort of quadrant, the river and the brook being the radii,
    and the curved ditch the arc. The area thus enclosed measures about
    seven acres, and lies between the river and the town, which covers its
    east and south sides.</p>

  <p>Within this area, occupying its north-east corner and about a quarter
    of its extent, is the inner court or citadel of the place, roughly
    rectangular, and measuring about 123 yards east and west, by 73 yards
    north and south. Its east and north faces rest upon the main ditch and
    the river, and its south and west faces are covered by a curved ditch,
    artificial, which gives the eastern outer ditch a second connexion
    with the river, and divides the outer, called ‚ÄúCastle Green,‚Äù from the
    inner court. The position was a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span> strong one, having the river, and
    beyond it a morass, towards the north, or threatened side, and to the
    south a ditch, in part double, and always filled with water.</p>

  <p>The inner court is further subdivided into two parts, of which the
    eastern half seems to have been raised into a sort of platform upon
    which probably Ine‚Äôs actual residence was placed.</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Warre, a very great authority in Somerset earthworks,
    speaks of a mound here, but as I cannot make out that there is any
    record or tradition of a mound in the technical sense, that is,
    a conical heap of earth, probably he calls by that name the very
    considerable bank and contiguous platform of earth, much of which is
    still seen. What occurred here, and by whom occupied, or what changes
    took place between the reign of Ine and the end of the eleventh century
    is not known, but the Normans, accustomed, as far as practicable, to
    occupy the Saxon seats, soon perceived the advantages held out by the
    position and earthworks at Taunton, and William Gifford, who held the
    lordship as Bishop of Winchester in the reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, seems to
    have decided upon building a regular castle. His successors, bishops
    of Winchester, were much here, and the castle received much addition
    at their hands, especially in the early Decorated period, of all of
    which traces more or less considerable still remain. The outer ward
    is traversed east and west by a road upon which were two gatehouses,
    of which the western was till recently represented by a fragment of
    wall and a stone bridge across the moat. Traces of a barbican, in
    part of timber, were discovered a few years ago while digging on
    the counterscarp. Of the eastern gatehouse the remains are still
    considerable. It was of large size, the entrance passage being 60
    feet deep, with portals at each end and at the outer end, and a large
    square portcullis groove. The upper floor contained a fine room, of
    which on the north side there remain two windows in the early Decorated
    style, which is that of the whole gatehouse. The gateway was placed
    just within the ditch, on the counterscarp or town side, on which
    some foundations, probably of a barbican, were laid open a few years
    since. The wall of the outer court is gone, save a small fragment on
    the south-west quarter, neither are there any of the ancient buildings
    remaining within the area, Bishop Fox‚Äôs school, the oldest of them,
    being later than the period when the defences were of much value.</p>

  <p>The defences and contents of the inner ward are less imperfect. The
    masonry here did not extend actually to the river, the immediate bank
    of which, as at Leicester, is very low, so that the enclosed ward
    occupied only about two-thirds of the whole moated area. The walled
    part is roughly triangular, the base being the east side, and the
    truncated part open to the west. This area seems further to have been
    divided by a cross wall into two parts, the keep, hall, and gatehouse
    being in the western, and in the eastern, the earthworks, which
    favours the notion of this having been the old English citadel. These
    earthworks are two banks along the east and south fronts, expanding at
    their junction into a rectangular platform of about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span> 80 by 120 feet.
    The banks have been used as terraces or ramps, the Norman wall having
    been built against them and along the river edge of the ditch. These
    banks are about 18 to 24 feet broad and about 10 feet high. Along
    the east face about 150 feet of the original wall remains tolerably
    perfect, and is about 25 feet high outside. This is returned along the
    river or north front, and near the angle is a buried arch at present
    invisible, and which may have been a postern or a sewer. From the south
    face the wall has recently been removed. At the south-west corner of
    this court is a dwelling-house, part of the wall of which is old,
    either Norman or Edwardian.</p>

  <p>The smaller or west court contains the chief remains in masonry, and
    of these the most remarkable is the keep. This is a well-defined
    though mutilated tower, standing upon the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall, of
    which it forms the north-west angle. It is rectangular, 50 feet north
    and south, by 40 feet east and west, with walls about 13 feet thick.
    There is no chamber below ground. The basement is vaulted with a heavy
    barrel vault, apparently original, and round-headed. Outside are flat
    narrow pilaster strips, dying into the wall at about 30 feet. There
    are traces of Norman loops in the wall, which may have been 50 feet
    high, and probably included three stories. At the north-east angle
    is a well-staircase leading to the battlements, probably in part an
    Edwardian addition. The entrance is most likely to have been in the
    south face, no doubt on the first floor, though there is nothing left
    to show this.</p>

  <p>From the keep, along the north front, the original, though much
    mutilated, Norman wall, with its flat pilasters and the jamb of one
    original window, crests the rising ground, as at Leicester, about 50
    feet from the river, and, also as at Leicester, evidently formed one
    side of the hall. At the end of the wall, about 140 feet from the keep,
    is a postern, with a segmental arch, possibly in substance Norman,
    though mutilated.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the south front, but at the south-east corner of
    this section of it, is the gatehouse, a rectangular structure,
    with an Edwardian portal, and some Perpendicular additions, square
    portcullis grooves, gates, and lodge. In the front are seen the holes
    for the chains supporting the drawbridge, now replaced by a permanent
    structure. Above the entrance passage is a chamber.</p>

  <p>Right and left of the gatehouse the curtain extends about 70 feet,
    terminating a short time ago in bold drum towers, of which one is gone,
    and the other caps the south-west angle of the ward, and connects
    this front with a short curtain leading to the keep. Against this
    wall stands a line of buildings ranging with the gatehouse. Opposite,
    against the north wall, is the hall, modern as to its inner wall,
    fittings, and roof, but very evidently occupying the site of the
    original Norman hall and domestic buildings.</p>

  <p>The south-west drum tower has been rebuilt or faced, but evidently
    represents the Edwardian or early Decorated works that replaced the old
    Norman curtain. The ditch along the west, and part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span> south fronts
    of this ward, has been recently filled up. The drum towers, curtain,
    and keep stood on its edge, and formed its scarp.</p>

  <p>Here, then, we have a combination of earthworks dating from the
    commencement of the eighth century; walls and keep the work of the
    early part of the twelfth century; and towers and gatehouses towards
    the end of the thirteenth century or early in the fourteenth century.
    Bishop Langton executed some additions here in 1490, and placed his
    arms outside the inner gatehouse. In 1496, the castle was taken by
    the Cornish rebels who rose against the close taxation of Henry <abbr title="7th">VII.</abbr>,
    and here massacred the Provost of Penrhyn. Bishop Horne made further
    repairs here in 1557.</p>

  <p>In the Parliamentary wars, Taunton was first occupied for the
    Parliament, then taken by Lord Hertford for the King, and finally
    retaken for the Parliament by Blake, who held it against a far superior
    force. The infamous Jefferies held the ‚ÄúBloody Assize‚Äù in the present hall.</p>

  <p>It has been thought that Ine‚Äôs castle was confined to the inner ward.
    No doubt his strong house was there, but the whole enclosure is not
    larger than Framlingham or other Saxon holds.</p>

  <p>The absence of a mound is rather peculiar, and it is remarkable
    that the Normans should have placed this keep on the lowest ground.
    Altogether, looking to its very curious though scanty remains, and its
    very ancient history, Taunton Castle is a work of unusual interest, and
    it is much to the credit of the Somersetshire arch√¶ologists that the
    keep has been converted into a museum, and the walls and earthworks
    converted into an embellishment to the ancient town to which the castle
    unquestionably gave rise.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="THURNHAM_CASTLE_KENT">THURNHAM CASTLE, KENT.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THURNHAM, called also, from the hill on which it stands, ‚ÄúGodard‚Äôs,‚Äù
    Castle, near Maidstone, is a curious example of a Norman castle placed
    upon what is evidently a British camp.</p>

  <p>The camp crowned the high point of a very steep spur, which juts out
    between a depression on the one side and a small deep combe on the
    other, in the great escarpment of the lower chalk, about four miles
    east-north-east of Maidstone. The earthworks were formed by scarping
    the central knoll, and perhaps raising it a very little, so as to form
    a slight mound, and thus especially strengthening its weak sides,
    those towards the root of the spur. On the lower or Thurnham front the
    defences, naturally strong, are reinforced by a ditch and bank, placed
    some little way down the hill, far below the body of the fortress, and
    intended to command the road which here winds up the ridge from the
    village and church of Thurnham, at the foot of the hill. The ground
    within this outer defence has been extensively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span> opened for chalk, and
    is so disfigured by heaps of quarry rubbish that but little can be
    accurately ascertained of its ancient dispositions.</p>

  <p>The Norman castle occupied a platform close west of the mound, and
    probably included within the British camp. Here stand the remains of
    the gateway and court, but as a trace of masonry is still seen upon the
    mound, it may be that it was included in the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> wall, or
    that upon it stood one of the circular or polygonal shell keeps which
    sometimes, with the Normans, took the place of the ordinary square
    keep, especially where there was an earlier mound to be fortified.</p>

  <p>The ruins are not considerable. They are composed of the two parallel
    walls of a gatehouse, having on either hand two large round-headed
    recesses, dividing the passage into two bays, and there are besides two
    small lodge doors, also round-headed, on the east side.</p>

  <p>Westwards from the gatehouse runs a low curtain wall, about 13 feet
    high, and 4 feet thick, for about 80 feet, ending in a broad flat
    buttress, perhaps the base of a square tower. The wall thence may be
    traced southwards, along the edge of the steep, whence it seems to have
    been continued towards the mound. A hollow way, cut in the chalk, winds
    from below, beneath and close to the west of this wall, and, making
    a bend, enters the gatehouse from the north. There are no traces of
    ashlar. Much of the wall shows a face of coursed flints. The work may
    be late Norman.</p>

  <p>On the summit of the knoll is a depression in the soil. This part of
    the work is so covered with thick bramble and underwood that it cannot
    be very accurately examined.</p>

  <p>Thurnham or Turnham occurs in Domesday, and was one of the numerous
    manors given by the Conqueror to Bishop Odo, and held under him at the
    survey by Ralph Curbespine. It then contained a church, and had been
    held under the Confessor by Sbern Biga.</p>

  <p>On Odo‚Äôs fall, 19 W. C., it was granted to Gilbert Maminot by the
    tenure of castle guard under Dover Castle. The holders under Maminot
    were a knightly family, who took their name from the place. Robert de
    Turnham held it <em>temp.</em> Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, and founded Combwell Priory.
    Possibly he built the castle. Robert had Robert, who died <abbr title="sine prole"><i lang="la">s.p.</i></abbr>
    13 John; and Stephen, who died also <abbr title="sine prole"><i lang="la">s.p.</i></abbr> 16 John.</p>

  <p>In the reign of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, Thurnham was held by Sir Roger de Northwode,
    who died 13 Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, leaving John, who married Joan de Badlesmere,
    and died 14 Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> Their son John died before his father, leaving
    Roger, who had Thurnham, and married Juliana, daughter of Geoffrey de
    Say, chief lord of the manor. Their son, Sir John, third baron, died 2
    Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>; and his son, Roger de Northwode, who was never summoned to
    Parliament, alienated Thurnham, and died <abbr title="sine prole"><i lang="la">s.p.</i></abbr>, leaving a brother.</p>

  <p>The Northwodes are said to have resided here, but the castle is thought
    to have been dismantled at an early period. Thurnham Castle is not
    named in the Ordnance map.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="TICKHILL_CASTLE_YORKSHIRE">TICKHILL CASTLE, YORKSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TICKHILL is a place of high antiquity, and both before and for some
    centuries after the Norman Conquest its importance as a strong place
    and the head of an extensive lordship was very considerable. Mr.
    Hunter, the accurate and accomplished historian of the district,
    suggests ‚ÄúThe-Wickhill,‚Äù in allusion to the village mount, as a
    probable etymology for the name, and cites ‚ÄúThunder-cliffe,‚Äù or ‚ÄúTh‚Äô
    Under Cliffe,‚Äù as an analogous case. It seems that near Sheffield
    Castle was a small green called ‚ÄúThe Wick-er,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTicken-hall,‚Äù near
    Bewdley, was the seat of an early fortress.</p>

  <p>Tickhill, however, though obviously an early name, is not recorded
    in Domesday, but is thought to be included in Dadsley, a name still
    extant in the immediate neighbourhood. In ‚ÄúDadesleia, Stantone, and
    Helg√¶li,‚Äù Elsi and Siward held eight carucates,‚ÄîRoger de Buisli held
    seven in demesne; there were also thirty-one burgesses, a class whose
    presence has been held to indicate a burh or castle. Roger de Buisli
    was tenant in chief of these and other manors, comprising the Honour
    of Tickhill, a division certainly based upon an earlier fee, of which
    Tickhill was the chief seat. The Norman Honour numbered sixty-five and
    three-quarters knights‚Äô fees, and extended from Yorkshire into the
    shires of Derby, Lincoln, Notts, and Leicester, including one manor
    in Devon. Tickhill, which seems to have been sometimes called Blythe,
    which, however, was also the name of a place in the adjacent part of
    Lincolnshire, was the chief seat of the powerful house of de Buisli
    during their somewhat brief career.</p>

  <p>Roger de Buisli received Tickhill from the Conqueror, who erected it
    into an Honour in his favour. Roger had a choice in his wide Yorkshire
    domains of three ancient English seats, Laughton-en-le-Morthen,
    Mexborough, and Tickhill. He selected Tickhill; and the two other sites
    retain their English earthworks, unaltered by Norman masonry, and
    changed only by time. Laughton seems to have been originally superior
    even to Tickhill, probably as the residence of Earl Edwin, being named
    in the Domesday Survey. Roger himself probably fortified Tickhill with
    masonry, the gatehouse and much of the wall being apparently his work.
    The foundations of the shell-keep look rather later, but may also be of
    this date. He was also the founder of Blythe Priory, in 1088. He died
    1098, and was succeeded by his son Robert, who died childless in the
    reign of Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p>The descent of Tickhill now becomes obscure. Roger had a brother,
    Ernald, who held six fees under Tickhill; and a sister, Beatrix, from
    whom descended the Earls of Eu. On Robert‚Äôs death, however, Tickhill
    was claimed by Robert de Belesme, as the next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span> heir; and, as he was
    powerful, and supported his claim by payment of a heavy fine, or
    bribe, he succeeded. On his death, however, King Henry stepped in and
    took possession. The castle remained for some time, with some brief
    intervals, in the Crown. William Fitz-Godric held it in 1142, and
    Stephen, Earl of Eu, for a time. Ralph, Earl of Chester, had it in
    1151‚Äì3. Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> seems to have settled it upon Eleanor, his queen, who
    founded the ‚ÄúChapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas within the walls.‚Äù</p>

  <p>It descended to Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and in his absence was seized by Prince
    John, and besieged for Richard by Pudsey, bishop of Durham. When John
    inherited it as king, he annexed his mother‚Äôs chapel to the chapter of
    Rouen. John was frequently at Tickhill, which is remarkable, as there
    was no park or chase annexed to it. He was here six times between 1200
    and 1216 for at least eleven days. Early in John‚Äôs reign, however, the
    Earl of Eu, being powerful, claimed Tickhill as the husband of Alice,
    heiress of Henry, Earl of Eu, and representative of Beatrix, sister
    of Roger de Buisli. Ralph de Issoudon, or De Lusignan, her husband,
    an earl in her right, in 1197, seems to have been son of Geoffrey de
    Lusignan, who was to marry a daughter of King John, in consequence
    of which the king agreed to restore Tickhill to Ralph and his wife,
    and John de Bassingbourn was ordered to give possession, which was
    supplemented by an order to the same effect, 1 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <p>Meantime, another claimant appeared, in the person of Idonea,
    representative of Ernald, Roger de Buisli‚Äôs brother, and who had
    married Robert de Vipont, a baron much employed by John, and not
    unfrequently in connexion with Tickhill. Thus, in 1204 he was concerned
    in certain repairs at the castle, as also in 1206, which included a
    barn and stables. In 1207 he was to be paid for these repairs, and he
    was also employed upon the king‚Äôs castles of Nottingham, Bolsover,
    the Peak, and Scarborough. In 1208, five dolia of red wine, such as
    would keep, were to be sent to him at Tickhill, for the king. Idonea,
    Vipont‚Äôs wife, held by descent six fees in Tickhill, and now claimed
    the rest against Countess Alice, 6 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Alice had the best of it;
    but in 9 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> she went abroad, probably to her Norman estates,
    and in consequence Tickhill seems to have lapsed to the Crown.</p>

  <p>Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, when king, granted it to Prince Edward, who, in 1254,
    settled it upon Eleanor of Castile, but in 1259‚Äì60, Edward de Lacy,
    Constable of Chester, used the phrase, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Baronia mea de Tikehull</span>,‚Äù as
    though absolute lord. Prince Edward, however, granted it to his cousin
    Henry, son of Richard, King of the Romans, in 1263.</p>

  <p>In 1296, John, Earl of Eu, revived the family claim. He was grandson of
    Alphonso (son of John, King of Jerusalem), by a daughter of Countess
    Alice. His claim was speedily set aside, he being an alien. This was
    the last assertion of the right, but a century later it was remembered,
    when Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr> created William Bourchier Earl of Eu and Lord Bourchier
    of Tickhill, titles only, not connected with the property, which
    remained in the Crown.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span></p>

  <p>In February, 1322, the castle was besieged for three weeks by Thomas
    of Lancaster, and this siege was one of the charges brought against
    him on his trial:‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">Et misit homines suos ... ad obsidendum castrum
    domini Regis de Tikhull; et qu√¶dam ingenia, ad projiciendum petras
    grossas super castrum pr√¶dictum, et homines in eodem castro ex parte
    domini Regis existentes; qui quidem proditores castrum illud, per tres
    septimanus continu√® insultando et debellando, obsederunt, et quosdem
    homines Regis ibidem interfecerunt</span>.‚Äù The castle was defended gallantly
    by Sir William de Anne, and relieved by the king in person. Tickhill
    was again settled upon a queen in the person of Philippa, who died in
    1369. In 1362, Edward exchanged Tickhill with John of Gaunt, against
    the honour of Richmond, and it descended with the other estates of the
    duchy of Lancaster. In the Parliamentary struggle it was held for the
    king, but surrendered after Marston Moor, and was dismantled. When
    thus held, its outer defences were the moat and the palisades on the
    counterscarp. The foundation of the chapel was dissolved, 1 Edward <abbr title="6th">VI.</abbr>
    The castle now belongs to the Earl of Scarborough.</p>

  <p>Tickhill Castle is an excellent example of a pre-Norman or English
    earthwork, composed of mound, fosse, and lower ward, converted into a
    Norman castle. It exemplifies exactly the manner in which the Norman
    engineers treated earthworks of this description, and how such works
    gave rise to one of the two great types of a Norman castle, that with
    the shell-keep. Tickhill is Laughton on a larger scale, the only
    difference being that the ditch of the mound is not carried wholly
    round it, but is wanting towards the attached area. Either it was never
    formed, or, what is not improbable, was filled up when the Norman works
    were constructed, or, as at Cardiff, at a much later period. Something
    analogous to this seems to have taken place at Kenilworth.</p>

  <p>In the original construction of this fortress advantage was taken of a
    knoll of soft sandstone rock to form the base of the mound. This was
    scarped, and the ditch dug, and the material employed in forming the
    upper two-thirds of the mound. A modern cave in the side shows this
    natural base. The castle is composed of the mound, and a court or ward
    appended to its western side, the whole included within a ditch. The
    mound is conical, about 60 feet diameter at its table-top, and about
    60 feet high, above the ward. The ward is a rounded and more or less
    circular area, save where it touches the mound, and includes about one
    quarter of its circumference. The exterior ditch follows the figure of
    this ward, and of the uncovered three-quarters of the mound: hence in
    plan it resembles somewhat a figure of 8, and it is this notch in the
    outline that makes it probable that the mound ditch was once complete,
    and the two parts of the fortress were, as at Barwick, distinct. The
    domestic buildings stood in the lower ward, on its western edge,
    opposite to the mound upon which was the keep. The gatehouse stands on
    the southern edge of the ward, between the domestic buildings and the
    keep. The curtain is broken down to the east, but elsewhere tolerably
    perfect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span> The ditch is filled up on the same side, and its place
    occupied as a kitchen-garden and by stables.</p>

  <p>Upon the summit of the mound are seen the foundations of the keep, a
    decagon, the sides of which average 16 feet 11 inches, of which each
    angle was covered by a flat pilaster of 4 feet broad, and very slight
    projection. The door seems to have been towards the south-west, of 4
    feet 6 inches opening. It lay between two sides of the exceptional
    length of 20 feet. The wall seems to have been, at the top of the
    plinth, 10 feet thick. The shell was apparently faced with ashlar. The
    whole building has been taken down with some care to the top of the
    plinth, a mere plain chamfer, formerly about 6 inches above the ground,
    and now covered to its level. Thus the actual dimensions of the plan
    are preserved, and the position and breadth of the entrance. It is said
    there is a well within the area, a few feet inside the place of the
    door. If so, it is at present effectually concealed.</p>

  <p>The keep at this time is ascended by seventy-five stone steps in a
    straight line on the western face. Possibly this was the original
    approach. If so, the path from the head of the stair must, as at
    Tamworth, have passed for 20 feet round the outside of the keep. The
    steps terminate below under the shelter of the curtain. The two ends of
    the curtain ascend the mound about two-thirds of its height. Probably
    they were continued to the summit, but no foundations are now seen at
    the keep level, and the plinth of the keep shows there was no bond.
    The curtains which thus ascended these mounds were rarely bonded into
    the keep, and do not seem ever to have risen to its full height. On
    the contrary, they seem to have only risen to the level of the top of
    the mound or to the base of those of the keep, the parapet probably
    being continued so as to stop the passage round the exterior. This
    seems to have been the case at Tunbridge, Berkhampstead, and Tamworth.
    At Hawarden the curtain abuts against the keep about 10 feet high, but
    with no original bond, and with a doorway in it opening outside the
    base of the keep.</p>

  <p>The curtain which enclosed the lower ward is here from 10 feet to 13
    feet thick, and 20 feet to 30 feet high, with a plinth at its interior
    base. It rises out of a bank which forms a ramp or terrace 15 feet
    broad, on both outer and inner sides. Inside, this ramp is about 8
    feet above the court level. Outside, it forms a walk all round the
    fortress, being carried by a bridge over the gateway, and in a step
    or notch round the slope of the mound. The curtain is entire from the
    mound to the dwelling-house, about 240 feet, along the north front,
    but to the west it is concealed by the house which represents the
    domestic buildings of the castle. It also remains from the house to
    the gatehouse, and about 50 feet or 60 feet beyond it along the south
    front. Towards the south-east about 300 feet are gone, but the last 78
    feet, where it again ascends the mound, are tolerably perfect.</p>

  <p>Where the outer wall skirts the mound it forms a revetment 6 feet high,
    and which may have been higher, and crested with a parapet to defend
    this front.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span></p>

  <p>The exterior ditch is broad and deep, and in part contains water.
    Formerly it was fed from an adjacent stream, which flowed all round
    it. Beyond the ditch was a bank of earth, of which traces and portions
    remain, especially towards the north. It is difficult to say whether
    there was a second ditch, owing to the encroachments of roads and
    buildings.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse deserves special notice, as an original and early Norman
    structure. It is 36 feet square, with walls 7 feet 6 inches thick, and
    has a round-headed gateway at each end, of 12 feet opening, with a
    plain rebate for doors, but no portcullis or chamfer. The inner space
    was covered with timber, and there was an upper story. This may have
    been partially rebuilt; it contains in the wall over the inner door a
    large Tudor window, probably an insertion.</p>

  <p>There is no staircase. The structure much resembles Porchester before
    the alterations. It is placed upon the curtain, with a bold exterior,
    and still bolder interior projection. The outer front of the first
    floor is ornamented with four stiff rude pediments, each a right-angled
    triangle, with a rude figure at the apex of each and in the hollow
    angle or gutter, joining each pair. The tympana are filled with small
    square blocks, each carved with an undeveloped dog-tooth ornament. A
    plain string marks the division of the two stages, and so far all is
    Norman.</p>

  <p>But although the upper part is unaltered, the lower part has been
    masked by a Decorated gateway with portcullis groove and pointed arch,
    while in front of and flanking this arch two walls, 6 feet thick,
    project 15 feet, and contained between them the drawbridge. Above and
    upon these, concealing the upper part of the arch of entrance, is a
    low flat bridge, which carries the exterior walk, or <i lang="fr">chemin de
    ronde</i>, over the entrance, and from which the grate was worked. Had
    it not been for this bridge, and its Decorated connexions, it might
    have been supposed that the <i lang="fr">chemin de ronde</i> was a mere modern
    pleasure walk, whereas it is clear that it was a part of the defence,
    a work covering the foot of the wall, and no doubt strongly palisaded.
    There is no trace of a parapet.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse seems early Norman, probably with most of the curtain the
    work of Roger de Buisli before 1089. The keep looks much later, but
    it must have been part of the original design, and possibly the works
    begun by Roger were completed by his son. In the Decorated period there
    were probably considerable additions. Probably when the gatehouse was
    masked, and the bridge thrown over it, the curtain also was repaired,
    and a new parapet added, and the <i lang="fr">chemin de ronde</i> formed. Leland
    speaks of a hall, now gone. Where the chapel stood is not known. A door
    case which may have belonged to it has been removed and set up inside
    the gatehouse, and outside is an old oak door of the style of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>,
    on which are carved the words,‚Äî</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Peace and grace</div>
        <div class="i0">Be to this place.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span></p>

  <p>The entrance-way now leads up to the gatehouse across a modern bridge,
    over the wet ditch. To the south of the place is a tributary of the
    river Torne or Thorne, which covered that front.</p>

  <p>This is one of the most curious castles in Yorkshire, not only for its
    pure Norman gatehouse, and the undisturbed foundation of its shell
    keep, but because it shows how the Norman lords availed themselves of
    an English seat, and how their architects or engineers accommodated
    their defences to the already existing earthworks. It should be studied
    in conjunction with Pickering for the general plan and the Norman
    works, and with Barwick-in-Elmete and Laughton-en-le-Morthen for the
    general resemblance of the earthworks. Unfortunately there is no plan.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AMONG the passes that communicate between the open country of the upper
    Usk and the Wye, in the neighbourhood of Talgarth, Gl√¢sbury, and Hay,
    and the valley of the lower Usk, there are two especially dangerous,
    and which, therefore, it behoved the Norman settlers to guard with
    peculiar care. These are the pass of the Bwlch, between Buckland and
    Cefn Moel, and the valley of the Rhiangoll. The strip of land bordering
    on the Usk, which flows close to the west of Mynydd Buckland, is
    very narrow, and in wet seasons was formerly scarcely practicable;
    and was besides, to a considerable extent, guarded by the castle of
    Blaen-Llyfni, which was specially built for the defence of the Bwlch,
    close to the north of which it is placed.</p>

  <p>The Rhiangoll rises in Cwm Catwg, a deep, dark hollow in the Black
    Mountains, and flows down to join the Usk about three miles above
    Crickhowel. Near its head, where it lies open towards the north-west,
    it was guarded by the hill-castle of Dinas, and lower down by Tretower.
    Still lower down, the Usk itself is protected by the castled mound of
    Crickhowel, and still lower by that of Abergavenny; so that between the
    seigniorial castles of Blaen-Llyfni, Dinas, and Abergavenny, and the
    private posts of Tretower and Crickhowel, the incursions of the Welsh
    of Brecknock and Radnor were liable to be checked in their advance, and
    altogether cut off in their retreat.</p>

  <p>Tretower stands in the meads of the Rhiangoll, on the left bank of
    the stream, about a mile above its junction with the Usk, at a point
    where a tump of gravel rises on the margin of, and a little above, the
    general level of the meadow, once evidently an impas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>sable morass, and
    even now by no means a favourable specimen of Breconshire farming. The
    meadow is traversed by several branches of the stream, here reinforced
    by divers springs and brooklets, which, added to the natural strength
    of the ground, made the place one of very difficult approach save from
    the slightly higher ground to the north-east.</p>

  <p>Tretower is a chapelry in the parish of Llanvihangel Cwm Du, and seems
    to have been the private estate of the owners of the castle, who, when
    the conquests of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> settled the Principality, deserted the small
    and inconvenient fortress for a larger house a little to its south, now
    occupied by a farmer, and showing some traces of the Decorated style of
    architecture.</p>

  <p>The castle was a three-cornered enclosure, having two round towers at
    its northern and southern angles, or the ends of its base, and the keep
    at its western angle or apex. The two sides are each about 60 yards in
    length, and the base about 80 yards. The entrance was probably near the
    centre of the base or eastern curtain, in the line of the present road
    to the farm-buildings which occupy this outer ward. Fragments remain
    of the two round towers, and about half of the northern curtain. At
    the gorge of the southern tower, nearly buried, is seen the crown of a
    large pointed arch which probably opened into its basement, though its
    breadth is unusual.</p>

  <p>The inner ward, within, or rather capping which, is the keep, is a
    square of about 23 yards by 18 yards outside, and 17 yards inside
    measurement, placed at the apex of the triangle; so that three sides
    of it are exterior to, and one within, the outer ward. It has been
    destroyed on the north and east sides; but the south side is perfect,
    and the west very nearly so. The foundations can be traced all round.
    This ward occupies the whole of a tump of gravel rising about 12 feet
    above the meadow, which is its defence on the west, south, and east;
    and it is so built that its lower part serves as a scarp wall, the
    ground within having been about 6 feet above the narrow bank or terrace
    outside. There were no towers at the two northern angles, which seem to
    have been chamfered off with a sort of spreading or buttressed base.
    From the south wall, at its west end, projects a half-octagonal tower,
    and at its east end another, much larger. They are but half-octagons,
    and have no internal projection. The wall was 8 feet thick, and 25 feet
    high to the battlements. In the remains of the west wall are traces of
    a recess, perhaps for a loop, a fireplace with a clumsy drop-arch, and
    higher up a window in the same style. These, in their present form, are
    late insertions, but probably represent original openings, as on the
    exterior is a broad flat buttress intended to carry the chimney-shaft.
    This wall has been a good deal pulled about at an early period. The
    south wall is exceedingly curious, and though evidently much altered,
    bears large marks of its original style. Near its west end, in the
    hollow angle, is a small round-headed doorway opening into a well-stair
    which led to the battlements, but has been blocked up. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>East of this,
    an opening in the wall (probably the place of a second door) shows a
    flight of steps descending in the wall to another door, also round
    headed, and now nearly buried. The stairs are lighted by an exterior
    loop. Higher up, at a different level, is a window recess having bold,
    heavy, flanking, engaged piers fluted in zigzag, and supporting a
    fragment of an arch-moulding worked in the same chevron pattern. It may
    be that this was a double window, or two arches of an arcade, for the
    fragments of the arch-head have somewhat that appearance.</p>

    <div class="caption">TRETOWER CASTLE.<br />
      TRETOWER CASTLE‚ÄîGROUND PLAN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Next, east of this, at the same level, is a doorway of 4 feet by 6
    feet opening, in the same fashion and style as the window, with jambs
    fluted in zigzag and the chevron moulding above. The work is rude, and
    the ornamentation only partially executed. All these openings have
    been walled up with early masonry. The east half of this east wall is
    occupied by a rectangular projection, forming a chamber 10 feet deep
    by 18 feet broad, which may have been a kitchen, since it contains
    a fireplace with a round back and gathering up to a cylindrical
    shaft, and at the ground level is a water-drain; also there are three
    round-headed loops, of which one is in the west wall, and in the east
    wall is a small round-headed door, 2 feet 9 inches broad, and opening
    upon the outer ward; it has no portcullis.</p>

  <p>The openings, of which traces remain in this wall, seem to show that
    the building was originally a rectangular Norman keep, having a
    basement and a first and a second floor, indicated by the lower door,
    the entrance to the wall stairs, and the door and window above. The
    southern projection is probably original, as is the small door in its
    side. The battlements, of which a part remain on the west wall, are,
    no doubt, restorations. They are composed of broad merlons with a
    cruciform loop in each, the cross-arm being very short.</p>

  <p>In the exterior of this building, near its ground level, a breach in
    the masonry discloses a cavity about 14 inches square, which pierces
    the wall parallel to its faces. This was evidently occupied by a beam,
    inserted as a tie, as at Brunlas, where also the timber has rotted
    away, and the cavity been exposed, and has given rise to a number of
    ingenious conjectures. In the centre of this square enclosure, and
    leaving only a space of from 7 feet to 9 feet between its exterior
    and the centre of each side, is the interior keep. This keep is a
    cylindrical tower, at its base about 43 feet in diameter, and battering
    inwards to a height of about 10 feet, where it is girt by a very bold,
    rather more than half-round bead or cordon, which marks the summit of
    the slope and the first-floor level. Here the tower is about 38 feet in
    diameter. From thence it continues to batter, though slightly, perhaps
    2 feet, to the base of the battlements, which are gone. It is now 70
    feet high from the ground level, which originally may have been 5 feet
    lower, and the tower 5 feet higher, making a total of 80 feet. About
    half-way up is a plain set-off of about 6 inches, reducing the diameter
    of the tower by a foot. With this exception the exterior is quite
    plain. The present entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span> to the basement or ground floor is on the
    north-east side, by a broken entrance of modern date, the making of
    which has been aided by the first-floor entrance, which is immediately
    above it, and of which it now makes a part. The tower is composed of a
    basement and three floors, and its interior diameter at the base and
    first floor is 20 feet. The floors were of timber, and are gone; and
    the roof seems to have been flat. The basement, now about half filled
    up, was about 10 feet high, and the wall at its floor about 11 feet 6
    inches thick. It was lighted by two loops in the north-west side, the
    splayed recesses of which are square-headed, and, as in Canterbury
    keep, have their inner opening closed above, so that the loop was on
    the level of the first floor. These loops are stopped up outside,
    evidently by very early masonry. In the south-west side is a door, of
    which the top is seen unburied, whence a flight of steps leads in the
    wall upwards and southward into the floor above, and this was evidently
    the only entrance to the basement floor.</p>

  <p>The entrance into the first floor was also the general entrance into
    the keep. The doorway, much broken, was 4 feet wide and 6 feet high,
    and about 10 feet above the original ground level. Over the doorway,
    outside, is a curious drip or hood, forming an equilateral arch, a sort
    of pediment; and on either side of the doorway are two holes, at the
    base and near the top, which seem to have carried the base of a wooden
    structure, probably covering an exterior stair. There is no portcullis.
    The door enters a passage vaulted with a drop arch, which traverses the
    wall leading direct by a second door, viz., into the first floor. From
    this passage, on the left, a door opens into a mural stair, 3 feet 3
    inches wide, which ascends in the curve of the wall to the upper floors.</p>

  <p>The first floor is 20 feet in diameter, and its walls about 8 feet
    6 inches thick; its floor rested on two large parallel beams laid
    north-west and south-east. To the north-east and south-west are large
    window recesses, 4 feet 6 inches broad, with drop chamfered arches,
    and having stone seats. In each was a window of one light, about 2
    feet opening, with an equilateral arch, and chamfered edges. In the
    south jamb of the south-west window is a door, the termination of
    the staircase, vaulted, and lighted by two external loops, and which
    has been already mentioned as rising from the basement floor. In the
    north-west wall is a large fireplace, with a bold flat stone hood
    dying into the wall above, beneath a bold bead moulding, and below
    resting upon two short columns with bell caps of a stiff early English
    character. The columns are cut away below, and in fact form corbels. On
    either side is a rude circular corbel, either to hold a light, or as at
    <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Briavel‚Äôs, to support the lateral thrust of the hood. This floor is
    18 feet high. It was the state-room.</p>

  <p>The staircase leading to the second floor, after ascending in the curve
    of the wall a few steps, terminates in a well staircase 6 feet in
    diameter, which continues the ascent to the second floor, and passes on
    to the battlements, as at Chepstow, Carlisle, Ludlow, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span> Newcastle.
    The staircase opens into the first floor by the intervention of a small
    recess or lobby in the thickness of the wall, where a door, now broken,
    opens into the main chamber.</p>

  <p>The second floor was also 18 feet high, and had two windows under drop
    arches, about 2 feet broad and 5 feet high, with equilateral arched
    heads, closely resembling those below. One opens to the south-east and
    one to the north-west. The latter has over its outer opening an angular
    drip, or hood, or pediment, like that over the great entrance below.
    Here also is a fireplace, and exactly above that in the lower room, and
    similar to it, only the jambs are rather shorter. The hearth-stone was
    supported upon a kind of bressummer, formed by a table projecting about
    18 inches from the wall below, and appearing as a carved moulding in
    the lower room. There is a set-off of about 6 inches at this level, to
    support the floor.</p>

  <p>Following the staircase, the third floor is entered by a lobby similar
    to the one below. The stair is lighted by loops, those near the bottom
    being flat-topped, those above lancet-pointed. There is one long loop
    divided by a transom, which forms a part of the set-off on the outside.
    The third floor has no fireplace, but it has two windows, similar
    to the others, opening north-east and south-west. The roof seems to
    have rested upon one main beam, stiffened by spars at either end,
    the supports of which remain in the shape of two stout plain stone
    corbels. Thus stiffened, the platform above would have carried an
    engine of almost any weight. The wall is about 8 feet 6 inches thick
    at the summit; its thickness above the cordon is, in fact, uniform. To
    give greater strength to the masonry along the course of the staircase
    and about the lobbies, the wall is thickened internally by a sort of
    pilaster, the sharp edge of which remains.</p>

  <p>Tretower is a rare, probably a solitary, example of a rectangular
    Norman keep, which has been gutted, and its central part occupied by
    an early English round tower. The space between the tower and the keep
    walls was then roofed in, probably in two floors. The alterations in
    the exterior Norman wall, blocking up the doors and windows, <abbr title="etc.">&amp;c.</abbr>, were
    probably made when the inner tower was built.</p>

  <p>The material of the keep is a hard variety of old red sandstone. The
    workmanship is good coursed rubble plastered within. The door and
    window quoins and the fireplaces are of ashlar, well worked, though
    plain, as is the whole building. The arches of the doors and window
    recesses are drop. Those of the windows are equilateral, and many of
    the loops lancet. The inner tower is wholly of one date, apparently
    late in the early English period.</p>

  <p>It is said that Tretower was a residence of the Welsh Lords of
    Brecknock before the Norman era. If so, they were attracted by the dry
    gravel tump, covered on three sides by a morass. The Norman occupants
    seem to have constructed a square tower or keep on the knoll, having,
    on one side, a base-court, probably also walled in. Late in the reign
    of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, the Norman keep was gutted, and a central stone tower
    built, and the triangular base-court enclosed by a curtain and mural
    towers.</p>

  <h3><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>CRICKHOWEL CASTLE.</h3>

  <p>This castle stands in the suburb of the town of Crickhowel, between it
    and the Usk, on the left bank of that river, and about a furlong from
    the parish church.</p>

  <p>Its principal and most interesting feature is a large conical mound,
    wholly artificial, about 50 feet high, and on its table top 60 feet
    diameter north and south, and 50 feet east and west. This mound has
    been surrounded by a ditch, traces of which remain on the east, south,
    and west sides. Towards the north it is encroached upon by a pond and
    some cottages. Appended to the mound, on its east side, and outside of
    its ditch, is an enclosure of irregular shape, roughly rectangular,
    but rounded towards the north-west, and including about two acres. It
    is contained within a low bank, the exterior slope of which has been
    scarped, and seems to have descended into an exterior ditch. This was
    the base-court or ward of the castle, the mound being the keep. On
    the south face of this ward, where the bank would have abutted upon
    the ditch of the mound, are the remains of two conjoined towers, one
    rectangular and one round. The loop-like windows of the former are
    evidently of Decorated date, and the two towers seem of the same age.
    Upon the north-east corner of the ward, on the counterscarp of the
    ditch of the mound is part of a round tower, which, with some heaps of
    earth about it, seems to be the remains of the gatehouse of the keep,
    which also was probably connected with a protected staircase ascending
    the mound, the way up which must have been on this side. These are the
    only buildings actually remaining upon the <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> of the ward,
    but it is evident that a wall was carried round its edge, of which the
    bank probably contains and conceals the foundation. Buck‚Äôs drawing,
    taken in 1741, shows this curtain, and upon its three angles three drum
    towers, of which one covered the outer entrance, and is opposite to
    the gatehouse of the keep. The summit of the mound is much broken up,
    and there are traces of the foundations of buildings which formerly
    stood here, and which seem to have been contained within a circular or
    polygonal shell which formed the keep.</p>

  <p>It is evident that Crickhowel, like Caerleon, Cardiff, Abergavenny,
    Brecon, and Builth, was a moated mound with appended base-court, upon
    which the Normans, on seizing the estate, constructed a castle. The
    earliest masonry was probably of the date of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, but enlarged
    and rebuilt in the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr></p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p><span class="smcap">Blaen-Llyfni</span>, or Blaen-Llevenny Castle, in Brecknockshire,
    stands above the Llyfni river, a tributary to Llangorse Lake. It was
    posted to guard the important pass of the Bwlch, above and a little
    within which it stands. It was in plan a parallelogram, contained
    within four curtain walls with towers at the angles, and apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span> a
    gatehouse towards the north-east. Part of the north wall is standing,
    but the remainder is a heap of ruins. The castle occupied a natural
    tump; about 20 feet above the outer level and around it is a ditch, in
    parts wet. The castle stands on a slope, which, towards the north, is
    very steep and very strong. It was built by, and long belonged to, the
    Norman lords of Brecknock; and on the occurrence of an attainder or
    minority was held by the Crown; hence it is not only mentioned in local
    story, but occurs from time to time in the records of the realm. It
    seems of the age of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, or perhaps somewhat earlier. In Buck‚Äôs
    time, 1741, much of the curtain remained and parts of the tower.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="TUTBURY_CASTLE_STAFFORDSHIRE">TUTBURY CASTLE, STAFFORDSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE high broken ground of Needwood Forest, contained between the Trent
    and the Dove, is brought to a termination eastward by the union of
    those streams upon the confines of the three shires of Derby, Stafford,
    and Leicester. About five miles above this confluence, upon the right
    or Staffordshire bank of the Dove, stand the town and castle of
    Tutbury, once, according to Leland, a residence of the Saxon lords of
    Mercia, and named, it is said, from the god Thoth, who presides over
    Tuesday, and is thought to have been worshipped in the enclosure of the
    castle. This etymology is supported by Wednesbury; but, however this
    may be, Tutbury was certainly an ancient stronghold, and possesses in
    that respect unusual natural advantages.</p>

  <p>The castle crowns the head or northern termination of a considerable
    ridge of new red sandstone rock, which projects from the high ground of
    Hanbury and Needwood, and forms an abrupt promontory above the broad
    and level meadows of the Dove. On the south or landward side the hill
    is partially severed from its parent ridge by a cross valley, within
    and about which is built the ancient town of Tutbury, celebrated from
    the days of John of Gaunt until the end of the last century for its
    attachment to the barbarous sport of bull-running.</p>

  <p>The natural position of the castle is strong and well-defined, and
    has been turned to account from a very remote period, and materially
    strengthened by Norman and pre-Norman art.</p>

  <p>Upon its west, south, and eastern sides the head of the ridge has been
    further protected by a broad and deep ditch, which thus covers about
    two-thirds of its circumference. Towards the north, where the hill
    projects upon the meadows, the ditch ceases, and this front, rising
    steeply about 100 feet, has been rendered steeper by art, and is
    further protected by a wide expanse of wet land, traversed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span> by a very
    ancient and broad mill-leat, and by the sinuous channel of the Dove.</p>

  <p>Upon the east and north-east fronts, where the area of the promontory
    was inconveniently large, two extensive semilunar spaces have been left
    outside the ditch. They are, in fact, outworks upon a large scale,
    useful for pasturing cattle in turbulent times, somewhat lower than,
    and commanded by, the main works; covering the ditch, and scarped,
    though not revetted, towards the field. They are separated by a deep
    ravine, up which the main approach to the castle ascended from the
    north-east, the direction of the Dove bridge, and probably of an
    earlier ford. On this, the east front, the contents of the ditch have
    been thrown inwards, crowning the scarp by an artificial bank about 15
    feet or 20 feet in height.</p>

  <p>Upon the south-west and west side the earth has been employed to form
    a large mound, about 40 feet high, and 70 feet across at its truncated
    summit, and which renders this front almost impregnable.</p>

  <p>The space between the east bank and the west mound, forming the south
    front, is occupied by the castle buildings, which, built upon the
    natural soil, crown the scarp of the ditch, and overlook the town.</p>

  <p>Opposite, also from the bank to the mound, is the north front, almost
    precipitous, and defended, therefore, by neither ditch nor bank. The
    space thus enclosed forms the base-court of the castle, and covers
    about three acres. It is in plan an irregular circle.</p>

  <p>The best view of these magnificent earthworks is from the summit of
    the mound, which not only predominates over the court of the castle,
    to its east, but westward rises very steeply about 140 feet from the
    meadows. The counterscarp of the ditch is here seen to terminate on the
    north-west, at the base of the mound in a sharply-defined falciform
    ridge.</p>

  <p>The masonry which has been added to these earlier defences is composed
    of a group of buildings on the south front, flanked by curtains which
    run, on the one hand, westward towards the mound, and, on the other,
    eastward, along the top of the bank by which that face is defended.
    This curtain is 6 feet thick at the top of its plinth, about 6 feet
    from the ground, to which level it is now reduced. There is evidence
    that it was about 20 feet high, with a rampart accessible from its
    flanking towers, and by a double flight of open steps from within. At
    one point is the vault of a large garderobe, marked in the ‚ÄúVetusta‚Äù
    drawing by a bartizan turret. This east curtain is broken by a lofty
    rectangular mural tower, of which the interior wall with a square
    angle-turret only remains, and which faced the turn of the road up
    to the castle, on the opposite side of the ditch. The bank has been
    removed here, so that the tower is built upon the original soil,
    and its basement entered from the court on a level. This tower is
    Perpendicular in style, and has evidently been blown up by gunpowder.</p>

  <p>At the north end of this curtain, at the north-east corner of the
    court, is the great gatehouse, a rectangular building pierced by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
    portal, and with lateral lodges. Above were other chambers of more
    pretention and larger size. This gatehouse is almost all outside the
    wall. Its south face rakes the ditch, and has a small projecting
    balcony at the first-floor level, communicating by a shaft with the
    basement lodge. Its north face looked towards the Dove; only its south
    and east walls remain. It had no flanking towers, the wall on one side
    of the gate being pierced by a loop. To it has been added, outside,
    flanking the gate and blocking up the loop, two thick solid cheeks of
    wall, from the front of which the drawbridge fell across the moat. The
    gatehouse seems to be of late Decorated date, its window recesses have
    half-round heads, and a window above the portal has something like
    Decorated tracery still remaining, and rudely indicated in the drawing
    given in the <span lang="la">Vetusta Monumenta</span>.‚Äù The portal has a flat segmental arch,
    and outside this is a low drop arch, part of the additions. The details
    of the drawbridge, to judge from the holes cut in the stone, were
    peculiar. Two portcullis grooves remain.</p>

  <p>The masonry of the drawbridge has been removed, and the ditch here
    solidly filled up with earth. The road from below, to reach this gate,
    is continued for some way along the crest of the ditch, within reach of
    the walls. Lower down it is commanded by the two demilunes. From the
    gatehouse westward the edge of the steep north front was crested by a
    curtain wall, probably low and light, of which there are slight traces.</p>

  <p>Upon the summit of the mound is a ruined round tower, evidently an
    erection of very modern times, probably as a summer-house, or an
    object in a view. There is said to have been an earlier building here,
    destroyed before the reign of Elizabeth, probably by John of Gaunt, and
    likely to have been a polygonal shell of masonry. It was called Julius
    Tower, Juliet being a not uncommon name for such structures.</p>

  <p>The castle buildings have been broken down, but what remains is as
    sharp and fresh as though lately executed. The outer wall and altered
    windows remain of the great hall, 61 feet long by 29 feet broad, and
    a group of state apartments at the east end. Here are two very fine
    crypts, no doubt cellars,‚Äîfitting receptacles for the very best of
    drinks,‚Äîentered from the court by handsome doorways and six or eight
    descending steps. They have been covered with barrel vaults, one of
    which was ribbed transversely and diagonally, with large carved bosses,
    probably of the time of Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> Above these are handsome rooms,
    with flush flat-topped chimney-places, with mouldings set with flowers
    and the ‚Äúhart lodged,‚Äù and what may be a conventional pomegranate.
    These buildings are in the best and purest Perpendicular style, and
    the profiles and details of the mouldings are admirably suited to that
    fine but sometimes rather friable material, red sandstone, here of very
    superior quality.</p>

  <p>In the court is a deep well, still in use. At the west end of the great
    hall is a brick building, probably the work of some Crown steward or
    lessee, about the time of Queen Anne or George <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span></p>

  <p>So far as can be observed, the castle exhibits no trace of Norman
    masonry. All the structures, walls, tower, gatehouse, hall, and
    apartments are nearly or quite of one date, and are probably the work
    of John of Gaunt, who resided here very frequently, and in regal state.
    This is very remarkable, because Tutbury is mentioned in Domesday, was
    the caput of a very important Norman honour, and the principal seat of
    the great Norman family of Ferrars, earls of Derby, from the Conquest
    to their ruin towards the close of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, since which
    time it has been, for the most part, in the Duchy of Lancaster.</p>

  <p>Shaw, in his ‚ÄúHistory of Staffordshire,‚Äù gives two most exaggerated
    drawings of this castle. Another, on a larger scale, a view from the
    east side, taken in the reign of Elizabeth, is engraved in the ‚ÄúVetusta
    Monumenta,‚Äù vol. i., pl. 39. This, amidst much absurd perspective,
    shows the gatehouse and east tower, what may be a chapel east window in
    the state apartments, and a round tower at the east foot of and built
    into the mound, besides a west curtain with three mural towers upon it.</p>

  <p>Tutbury was held for the king, and taken by the Parliament in the wars
    of Charles <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, and subsequently, by order of the House, reduced very
    nearly to the condition in which it is now seen.</p>

  <p>It may be mentioned that an addition to both the defences and the
    resources of the castle has been provided in the leat, known as the
    Fleam, in part only an artificial channel, which leaves the Dove about
    a mile above the castle, is led beneath its walls where it still works
    a large and very powerful mill, and finally returns to the river some
    way down, after a parallel course of about three miles.</p>

  <p>Although the temporal evidence of the splendour of the house of
    Ferrars has disappeared, the memory, as usual, of their ecclesiastical
    beneficence has been preserved. The parish church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, once the
    church of the Ferrars Abbey of Tutbury, still stands a stone‚Äôs throw
    from the castle wall, and seems anciently to have been included within
    the outer defences. It was founded by Henry de Ferrars, in the reign
    of Rufus, and has a Norman nave, clerestory, and aisles; and its west
    end is one of the most perfect and richest Norman fronts in existence.
    This structure, which had been much misused, was happily placed under
    the judicious care of Mr. Street, who was engaged to restore the Norman
    parts, and add a large semi-circular apse to the chancel. This is
    probably the chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary within the castle, in which (18 Edward
    <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>) Edmund Earl of Lancaster founded a special mass.</p>

  <p>Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned in Tutbury Castle, under the care of
    George Earl of Shrewsbury, then constable.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="URQUHART_CASTLE_INVERNESS_SHIRE">URQUHART CASTLE, INVERNESS-SHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ABOUT half-way between the two extremities of Loch Ness, the loch is
    suddenly reduced by about one-third of its ordinary breadth by the
    projection from its western shore of a bold headland, under cover
    of which the glens of Urquhart and Moriston open upon the loch, and
    contribute to it, across a marshy deposit of gravel and peat, their
    respective waters.</p>

  <p>The headland which is thus partially isolated between these waters
    and the loch is moderately lofty, and slopes down steeply towards its
    extremity at the north-east, again to rise and finally to terminate in
    an oval and rugged knoll of rock, which stands out from 50 feet to 100
    feet above both the water and the contiguous land. Upon and covering
    this knoll is placed Castle Urquhart, which is thus a very prominent
    object from Lochness, and combines, in a very remarkable degree,
    natural and artificial defences upon its <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> and within its
    area.</p>

  <p>The rock, open at each end, and along its north-eastern side towards
    the loch, is protected on the land side by a deep and broad ditch,
    quarried across the neck of the peninsula from shore to shore, not,
    indeed, to the level of the water, by from 10 feet to 12 feet, but to
    a depth which at one point gives a precipitous height of 30 feet to 40
    feet to the face forming its scarp.</p>

  <p>In general plan, the castle, like the rock it stands upon, is an
    irregular oval, reduced to something of an hour-glass figure by the
    indentation of a small cove near its centre. At the north and most
    prominent end is the rectangular keep. On the landward front is the
    gatehouse, and in the side opposite appears to have been a small
    tower. The <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> is completed by curtain walls, ranging in
    thickness and height from 4 feet to 9 feet, and from 20 feet to 40
    feet, according as they supported buildings within, or occupied weak or
    strong points in the defence.</p>

  <p>The entrance is by a causeway of masonry, 12 feet broad, having a
    roadway between parapets, and about 80 feet long from the counterscarp
    to the scarp of the ditch. At about 40 feet from the counterscarp,
    and 6 feet beyond the centre of the ditch, there, 10 feet deep, is an
    opening of 20 feet, formerly occupied by a drawbridge, beyond which the
    parapets are higher, and probably formed part of some kind of advanced
    work, for the management and protection of the bridge. This part of the
    defence occupied the remainder of the causeway proper, about 20 feet,
    the ditch here being 80 feet broad, and a platform of 20 feet, with a
    rise of 6 feet, intervening between the end of the causeway and the
    gate.</p>

  <p>The gate is removed about 6 feet to the south of the line of the
    causeway, so as to check a rush upon it. It is a plain round-headed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
    portal of 9 feet opening, between two half-round towers, and above it
    is the usual small look-out window of the portcullis chamber. Just
    within the gateway is the square groove, in which hung the portcullis,
    and beyond is a barrel vault, ribbed at intervals, for gates, and
    having a lodge door on the left hand. The passage ends in a plain but
    good round-headed gateway, the coigns and ring stones of which are of
    excellent ashlar, and which is set in the inner face of the gatehouse.
    This is a rectangular building, with two half-round towers flanking its
    outer entrance, and on each side of the central passage is a chamber
    also barrel-vaulted, but having semi-circular and semi-domed west ends.
    One of these rooms, as mentioned, opens from its side into the passage,
    and the other from its end, into the court. The gatehouse had an upper
    floor, also vaulted, and apparently also a second floor, of which
    traces remain. Fragments of a chimney-shaft which has fallen from its
    front, encumber the causeway.</p>

  <p>Emerging from the gatehouse, the rugged character of the interior
    comes at once into view. On the right is a path between two knolls
    of rock; that on the left moderately high, and not quite extending
    to the waterward curtain; that on the right high and steep, and its
    perpendicular face forming the landward curtain, the wall crowning
    which is 9 feet thick. At the south-east end, where the two ridges
    unite, is a small circular eminence, which may have been a beacon. This
    part of the outer ward is a fortress in itself, and upon its highest
    ground are traces of buildings. A fragment of the waterward curtain
    still stands about 30 feet high, and 6 feet thick; but there are no
    traces in this quarter of mural towers.</p>

  <p>The gatehouse opens upon the narrowest part of the ward, where it is
    indented by a small cove. The curtain was carried round this cove, and
    contained a postern, whence a path led down to the water, here shielded
    by the cliff. There is a window in the curtain,‚Äîa part probably of a
    building for the protection of the postern and the galleys below.</p>

  <p>The way from the gatehouse towards the left leads to the keep. It rises
    by a steep curve between, on the right, a high wall of some ruined
    building, and on the left a curious knoll of rock, scarped steeply into
    a rectangular figure, about 30 feet high, and on the top of which are
    foundations of a building, 15 feet by 30 feet, which must have been
    as tall as the upper floor of the gatehouse, and have commanded the
    adjacent curtain, from which it is separated by a narrow hollow way.
    Following the curved road, a cross wall is reached, which cuts off the
    inner from the outer ward, and formed an outwork to the keep. This
    ward is three-sided,‚Äîa sort of quadrant, the keep being at the apex.
    The land and waterward curtains form the two sides, and the base is a
    shallow curved ditch, in which is built the wall, and against it are
    two buildings like barracks. Between their inner ends was the entrance.
    This ward was exceedingly small, and is now thickly encumbered with
    ruins.</p>

  <p>The keep is an excellent example of the stern rectangular Scottish
    fortalice of the fifteenth century. It is about 40 feet square, of
    four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span> stages, and built on the steep, so that its basement is above
    ground on the outer, and below it on the inner, or court side. This
    basement is 16 feet by 18 feet within, barrel vaulted, with walls 10
    feet to 16 feet thick, with a loop rising to the light on the land
    side. It was evidently the prison. The door is opposite to the loop,
    and opens into a small lobby, having on the left the foot of the
    well-stair, and in front a postern, 4 feet wide, flat topped, and
    closed by a door, which opened on a small platform about 25 feet above
    the loch, which is reached by a steep winding path. The turnpike stair
    is 8 feet in diameter, and is contained in the north-east angle of
    the tower, opening upon each floor, and finally upon the battlements.
    It makes no external projection, but is seen within, cutting off an
    angle from each floor. The basement and the highest floor are the only
    vaulted chambers.</p>

  <p>The first floor is lighted by a segmental arched window to the court,
    and by small square-headed loops towards the water. These vary from 6
    inches to 2 feet in breadth of opening, and each has, a little below
    it, an oeillet-hole, which opens from the window-seat. No fireplace
    remains, but the east wall is destroyed, in which it may have been.
    This chamber seems to have been entered only by the well-stair.</p>

  <p>The second floor has also openings under flat segmental arches, and
    on the south side is the main door, opening about 20 feet above the
    ground, and reached either by wooden steps or some other means now
    destroyed.</p>

  <p>The third floor, or fourth stage, differs from the rest in that a small
    chamber is contained in the south-eastern angle, the door into which is
    in the south wall, near its east end. This may have been an oratory,
    but, as the east wall of the keep is gone, and with it the east end of
    this chamber, which also is inaccessible, such details as may remain
    have not been examined. In the west wall of the main chamber is an
    excellent flat segmental arch in ashlar, which spans a fireplace and
    a window looking down the loch. This upper story was covered with a
    vault, in the west side of which are traces of a side arch, covering
    that over the fireplace and window. Most of the main vault has fallen in.</p>

  <p>There do not appear to be remains of any garderobes. The parapet is
    gone, but the wall is crowned by a bold moulding, and beyond this, at
    each angle, there is a row of short corbels, which probably carried the
    usual bartizan turrets. Over the door, at the top of the wall, are four
    bold corbels, which evidently carried a machicolation for its defence.</p>

  <p>Urquhart is more extensive than most Highland castles, and the traces
    of barracks show that its area was turned to full account. It would
    contain a garrison of from 400 to 500 men. Though the masonry is
    rough, it is good, the proportions of the keep are excellent, and the
    ashlar work used for the doorways, quoins, and window dressings, is
    well executed. What arches remain are round-headed or segmental, not
    pointed. At the north-east angle the keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span> has a small short buttress
    set on anglewise, and one, also short, of a pilaster character, and
    slight projection, set on the west face of the north-west angle. The
    curtain springs from the keep, half of which is outside it.</p>

  <p>Urquhart is one of the chain of fortresses which stretched across
    the great glen from Inverness to Inverlochy, and were employed from
    an early period to defend and overawe the country. By some accounts
    it is spoken of as belonging to the Comyns of Badenoch, but certain
    it is that when Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> was at Kildrummie, near Nairn, in 1303,
    he despatched a party who laid siege to this castle, and with some
    difficulty took it, putting Sir Alen de Bois, its governor, and the
    garrison, to the sword. In 1334 it was held for Baliol by Sir Robert
    Lauder, of Quarrel Wood, as governor; and the office seems to have
    been heritable, for Lauder‚Äôs daughter married Chisholm, and their son,
    Sir Robert Chisholm, of Chisholm, who had Quarrel Wood, had also the
    constableship of Urquhart, then, and probably always, a royal castle.
    Chisholm‚Äôs title, however, was insecure, for in 1359 David <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> disponed
    the barony and castle to William, Earl of Sutherland, and John, his son.</p>

  <p>After this, Urquhart was held under the Crown by the Grants of
    Freuchie, afterwards of Castle Grant, who, as chamberlains for the
    Crown, got possession of most of the adjacent lands. In 1509, James
    <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, under an Act of the Scottish Parliament, granted three-fourths of
    Urquhart Lordship, and of the Baronies of Urquhart and Glenmoriston, to
    Grant of Freuchie, and his two sons, from whom descended the Grants of
    Glenmoriston and Corriemony. The castle has since remained in the Grant
    family, and is now the property of the Earl of Seafield, whose house of
    Balmacaan is in the lower Valley of Urquhart.</p>

  <p>It appears that the Knights of the Temple had an establishment in the
    Bay, and brought into cultivation the lands on its eastern shore.
    Probably they were constables of the castle. On the farm of Phinians is
    still a place called Temple.</p>

  <p>Until after the rebellion of 1745 Glen Urquhart was in a very disturbed
    state. Grant did not reside there, and the people were continually
    attacked by the clansmen from Glengarry, Lochiel, and Kintail.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to establish with any precision the date either of the
    early or the present castle of Urquhart. The ditch is no doubt much
    older than the siege of 1303. The remains of the castle now standing
    can scarcely be older than the fifteenth century, and probably it was
    one of those built about the middle of it, in accordance with the
    strong recommendation published by James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> on his return from his
    captivity in England.</p>

  <p>An excellent account of this part of the Highlands, and of the descent
    of the Urquhart property, will be found in the ‚ÄúNew Statistical Account
    of Scotland, for Inverness-shire,‚Äù <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 43.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="WAREHAM_DORSETSHIRE">WAREHAM, DORSETSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WAREHAM and Corfe are the keys of Purbeck, or rather Corfe is the
    fortress and Wareham the bridge-head of that bold projection of the
    chalk of Dorset, the southern headland of which bears the name of the
    protomartyr of England, and of which the triple spurs of Durlston,
    Peverell, and Studland form the eastern points, each with its own
    bay, and the whole protecting from the prevalent west wind the great
    indentation of the coast between Purbeck and the Needles, in the bight
    of which opens the harbour of Poole, and, under Hengistbury Head, the
    mouth of the twin streams that once gave name to Christchurch, before
    either castle or priory rose upon the banks of the Avon.</p>

  <p>To the Northmen, these headlands, bays, and rivers were intimately
    known. Their long ships here found shelter while the hardy seamen
    ravaged the country of which they were one day to become joint
    inheritors. Though called, like Sheppy and Portland, an island, Purbeck
    is, in truth, not even a peninsula. If, indeed, it were to subside
    from 50 feet to 100 feet, the great chalk ridge which extends from
    Lulworth to Studland would alone be visible above the waters, and the
    low broad valley which marks the course of the Nether Frome and the
    Piddle would be covered, and form, with Poole harbour, a considerable
    estuary. Even now the river valleys are low and moist, and in the
    eighth and ninth centuries were no doubt an impracticable morass. Where
    nature had done so much, there remained but little needed from art, and
    accordingly the military remains in Purbeck are scanty. Worbarrow, a
    strong half-circular camp of banks and ditches, crowns the steep cliff
    at one end of the great ridge, and Corfe or Corfe-gat, occupies a gap
    or gate near its centre, while Wareham, posted to the landward of the
    marsh, and between the two rivers, guards effectually the approach from
    the north. Camps on sea-cliffs are generally supposed the work of those
    who used the sea, and drew up their galleys upon the beach; if this be
    so, Worbarrow must be the work of the Northmen, though in any other
    position it would be regarded as British. Corfe is probably entirely an
    English port; what Wareham is forms the subject of the present notice.</p>

  <p>Wareham, a town which is still a Parliamentary borough, though one of
    its members was shorn away in the great struggle for reform, is built
    upon a knoll of chalk, the eastern extremity of a broad low ridge
    which descends and becomes narrower from the west and north-west, and
    finally sinks down into the lowland a little east of the town. This
    ridge divides the valleys of the Frome and the Piddle, the principal
    streams of Dorset, and its termination marks the meeting of the waters
    which flow together into the backwater of Poole Harbour. The Piddle
    lies to the north of the ridge, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span> Frome to the south. The
    town between them is about half a mile broad, and their bridges are
    connected by its main street. In figure the town is nearly square,
    the west face about 600 yards, the north face 650 yards, and the area
    is pretty evenly divided by the main street, which is crossed by a
    second street, at right angles, thus dividing the town, after the Roman
    fashion, into four quarters. As at Wallingford and Tamworth the outline
    of this rectangular figure is an earthwork, within which the town was
    built, and which is now all too wide for its shrunken prosperity. The
    defence is a simple bank and ditch, the contents of the latter being
    piled up to add to the height of the former; but as the area inclosed
    is naturally high, with a steep slope to the north and east, on these
    two sides the bank is a scarp only, the river on the north forming
    the ditch. To the east the ground is not quite so low, and there is
    no river: here therefore is a ditch. The northern scarp is about 45
    feet high, with a slope varying from one and a half to two to one. Its
    crest is 15 feet broad, and it rises about 15 feet above the ground
    within and behind it. Towards the west end this bank is rugged and
    angular; the eastern half is very uniform, and seems never to have been disturbed.</p>

  <p>The northern side is straight, or nearly so; the eastern has a low
    salient near its centre. This side is not carried to the river. There
    is indeed a hollow way, which seems to represent the ditch, but the
    bank is wanting for the last 200 or 300 yards. The western face is far
    stronger, and more perfect. Here the bank, of full size, is carried
    down to the margin of the river, and the ditch is broad and deep. This
    was the weak side, the exterior ground being high. This bank also is
    much cut about, and it is pretty clear that in the Parliamentary wars
    an attack must have been apprehended from the north-west, as the bank
    is notched as for embrasures for guns, and there are various small
    mounds to prevent them from being reached by a lateral and raking fire.
    The ditch also, instead of being cut to a central line, V-shaped, as
    usual in medi√¶val fortifications, and as is the case with this ditch
    near the river, is broad and flat-bottomed, as though it had been
    widened and partially filled up to suit the requirements of the art of
    defence as practised in the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>There is no earthwork along the south or Frome front, towards which the
    ground slopes gradually. No doubt the river was a defence, as it was on
    the other front, but the absence of any special work on the south and
    south-eastern quarters looks as though those who constructed the work
    came from the sea, and desired to guard Purbeck, whereas the historical
    presumption is that Wareham must have been thrown up against invaders,
    and that it was a British fortress against the Saxons, and an English
    fortress against the Danes.</p>

  <p>Of the four pretty equal quarters into which the area is divided, the
    south-western contains a later and subsidiary work, thrown up upon the
    bank of the Frome, and a little in the rear of the main defence. This
    is a conical mound, flat topped, rising about 50 feet above the river,
    and about 60 feet in diameter at its summit. It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span> a ditch proper
    to itself, about 60 feet wide, dividing it from the main bank, and
    to its east and south-east are traces of other and lower earthworks,
    which no doubt included the base courts or wards usually appended to
    such mounds. This whole tract, however, is exceedingly obscure, being
    laid out in lanes and courts and walled gardens. Here stood the Norman
    castle, built, as usual, upon the earthworks of the English residence.</p>

  <p>There is another earthwork, also within and later than the main
    defence, found in the north-eastern quarter. This is a rectangular
    inclosure about 60 yards by 30 yards, within a bank of about 4 feet
    high with a base of 12 feet and an exterior ditch about 6 feet broad.
    There is an entrance at one end, and the angles are slightly rounded
    off, and, as the north-east angle rises somewhat with the tail of the
    adjacent bank, it is clear that it is a later work. This looks exactly
    like a small Roman camp, though in such a position it seems much out of
    place. It is called the bowling-green, and may have been laid out for
    that game. It is difficult to say what it is.</p>

  <p>Of the two roads which intersect Wareham, that running north and south
    is the main one, and leads to Corfe. The Frome bridge over which it is
    carried is said to replace one built in the reign of William Rufus. The
    east and west road is an important way in one direction, as it leads
    from Dorchester, and may well therefore be Roman. After reaching the
    cross it is continued eastwards, but this branch of it led nowhere from
    the town.</p>

  <p>Wareham, like Wallingford, was well supplied with ecclesiastical
    establishments, there having been within its limits eight churches and
    a priory. The priory, originally founded it is said by Adhelm, bishop
    of Sherborne, who died 709, certainly existed as a nunnery before 876,
    when the town was taken by the Danes. The church, dedicated to the
    Virgin, is now the principal church in the place, and Trinity, now used
    as a school, was probably the chapel of the castle. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin‚Äôs is a
    small church upon the eastern edge of the deep cutting through which
    the north road enters the town. It has a small late tower, but the nave
    and part of the chancel seemed early Norman date. The sites are pointed
    out of the chapels of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael,
    All Hallows, and another <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John.</p>

  <p>Nothing of the masonry of the castle remains above ground, but the
    adjacent walls evidently contain much old material, and in one of them
    is an old Norman doorway, with a bold chevron moulding round the head,
    interspersed with a line of roundels. This no doubt belonged to the castle.</p>

  <p>There is a great resemblance in position and plan between Wallingford
    and Tamworth and to some extent Cardiff, and Wareham. In each case the
    general earthwork is rectangular, of bold profile, and has a single
    ditch, and is placed near a river, and on that side unbanked. Each
    also has a mound towards the river, with its own proper defences, and
    upon each the Normans placed a shell keep. There is no evidence of
    Roman occupation of any of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span> places, though the road from Wareham
    to Dorchester may be Roman, and if the line of the Ackebury ditch
    from Sarum to Badbury were produced, it would pass close west of this
    place. Possibly the rectangular defences were the work of the Romanised
    Britons, the mound being an English addition of the ninth century. The
    work has never been known as a ‚ÄúChester.‚Äù</p>

  <p>Wareham was an important place in the West Saxon kingdom. King
    Beorhtric, who married the daughter of Offa, and in whose time the
    Danes first landed in Britain, was there buried in 800. In 876 the
    Danes attacked and took Wareham, but submitted to Alfred, and retired
    to Exeter. Florence says of the Danes:‚Äî‚Äú<span lang="la">Castellum quod dicitur Werham
    intravit; ubi monasterium sancti-monialium inter duo flumina Fraw et
    Terente it in paga qu√¶ Saxonice dicitur. Downseto, tutissimo situ
    terrarum situm est, nisi ab occidentali parte tantummodo, ubi contigua
    est terra</span>.‚Äù And it is on that side that the works are the strongest.
    Some of the Danes left Wareham by sea and some on horseback. In the
    following year, however, they were again at Wareham, and their fleet
    was wrecked off Swanage, and 120 ships lost. At this time Wareham
    became the Danish head-quarters. A century later, in March, 978, King
    Edward, slain at Corvesgate or Corfe, was buried silently at Wareham,
    to be translated afterwards to Shaftesbury. In 982, Wulfwin, abbess of
    Wareham, there died. In 998, the Danes were again there, and in 1015
    Canute sailed up the Frome, burning and plundering as he went. Domesday
    relates that the Confessor held 143 horses in demesne in Wareham. There
    were two mint-masters, but at the survey the town was in a desolate
    condition, and many houses were destroyed.</p>

  <p>The castle is mentioned in Domesday:‚Äî‚ÄúOf the manor of Chingestone the
    king has one hide in which he made the Castle of Wareham, and for that
    he gave to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs the church of Gelingham, with its appendages,
    to the value of 40 shillings.‚Äù It is the only castle mentioned in
    the county. Chingestone is the manor of Corfe Castle, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs
    the Abbey of Shaftesbury. Robert, Duke of Normandy, was for a time
    imprisoned in the castle, as was Robert de Belesme, who is here said
    to have starved himself to death. Town and castle were burned in the
    wars of Stephen and Maud. Her great champion, the Earl of Gloucester,
    embarked here on his way to Anjou in 1142, and William, his son, was
    governor when the town was taken by Stephen. The Earl then retook it,
    the castle holding out against him for three weeks. It was at that
    time that he took Lulworth, and probably built ‚ÄúBow and Arrow‚Äù Castle
    in Portland. King John landed at Wareham in 1205 and visited the
    place four times, staying about fifteen days in the years 1209‚Äì12‚Äì15,
    and 1216. Peter of Pomfret, was hanged here in 1213. Then and long
    afterwards it was rather a noted seaport, and as late as 1558 ships
    of fair size reached its quays. The ‚ÄúCastle Hill‚Äù was granted away by
    James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> The western earthwork long bore the name of the ‚ÄúBloody Bank,‚Äù
    from the execution there of Judge Jeffreys‚Äôs victims.</p>

  <p>During the civil war Wareham was the scene of much fighting, being
    taken and retaken many times. It was garrisoned by the Parliament in
    1642, then taken for the king, then in 1643 retaken for the Parliament.
    In 1644 the Royalists took it by storm. It was in these wars that the
    west bank was so much altered, to make it suitable for the defensive
    system of that day.</p>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 class="nobreak" id="WHITE_CASTLE_MONMOUTHSHIRE">WHITE CASTLE, MONMOUTHSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WHITE CASTLE, called also from the parish in which it stands, Llanteilo
    Cresseny, and in the records ‚Äú<span lang="la">Album Castrum</span>,‚Äù stands upon very high
    ground about five miles east of Abergavenny, and commands an extensive
    and completely panoramic view over a country eminently characteristic
    of the old red sandstone. Within the wide circumference are mountains
    and hills green to their summits, deep valleys, oaks and elms of
    great size and in great profusion, and pastures of unusual richness.
    It is not to be marvelled at that the Welsh, having lost so glorious
    a possession, should strive to recover it, or that the English and
    the Normans, having won, should spare no labour or expense in the
    construction of strong places to enable them to retain it.</p>

  <p>Unlike Grosmount, Skenfrith, Goodrich, and Chepstow, and the other
    castles upon the Munnow and the Wye, and the seaboard of the Channel,
    White Castle is far removed from any watercourse or defensible river,
    and is only to be reached by a long and steep ascent. It is five
    miles and a half from Skenfrith, and five from Grosmount‚ÄîGrosmount
    and Skenfrith being four miles and a half apart‚Äîand forms the western
    and most exposed point of the celebrated trilateral. Its decay is due
    rather to time than to violence, for its walls and towers are all
    standing, and what is wanting are those parts which would naturally
    give way to rain and frost, or from time to time be removed for the
    rebuilding of houses and cottages in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>White Castle is also as peculiar in its arrangements as in its
    position. It has no keep, and so far it resembles the Edwardian
    castle; but, unlike those structures‚Äîof which Caerphilly in South,
    and Beaumaris in North Wales, are typical examples‚Äîits main defences
    are confined to a single line, covered, however, at the principal
    entrance by a walled earthwork or barbican, and at the lesser entrance
    by a second and rather smaller earthwork, without, or with but little
    masonry. Its ditches also are on a formidable scale, both for depth,
    breadth, and extent, and altogether, both in position and details, it
    is not inferior in strength to any castle in the March, and is besides
    in the first class as regards capacity.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span></p>

  <p>It is composed of a central ward, in general figure hexagonal, but
    oblong and somewhat pear-shaped, its internal diameter, north and
    south, being 50 yards, and its greatest cross diameter, east and west,
    37 yards. The northern end measures, also internally, 15 yards, the
    southern 18 yards. The sides next to the north end are, in length, 27
    yards, those next the south end 23 yards and 26 yards. The wall is 10
    feet thick at the base, and slopes externally to 7 feet at a height of
    15 feet. In height it is about 30 feet to the rampart walk or allure.
    The towers at the two southern angles are 18 feet internal diameter,
    with walls 7 feet thick. The two middle towers are 12 feet, the other
    two at the northern angles form the great gatehouse, and are 13 feet.
    They are about 45 feet high. The four southern towers have a basement
    floor a little below the court level, with one loop; a first floor with
    three loops, and a second floor, whence was a way to the ramparts of
    the curtain. There seems, also, to have been an upper or third story.
    The floors were all of timber, and there are no staircases or mural
    chambers. The gorge walls of the two southern towers are broken away,
    that of the western partially so; that of the eastern is perfect, and
    contains the entrance doorway of 3 feet opening. The gatehouse towers
    are also entered at the gorge from the court, but the gorge wall is
    thicker, and contains a series of mural staircases ascending to the
    summit. These are not ‚Äúturnpike,‚Äù and are not continuous, but begin
    anew at each floor. The gateway, concealed, save from the front, by
    the unusually bold projection of the flanking towers, has a passage 10
    feet wide and 8 feet deep. The barrel-vault remains, but the ashlar of
    the internal gate is gone, and its former existence is only shown by
    a bar-hole. Of the outer gateway two bar-holes remain, and a fragment
    of the portcullis groove, which is 4 inches square, and placed outside
    the gate, so that the grate was wholly visible even when raised,
    unless, indeed, concealed by a timber brattice. It was worked from a
    machicolation between the towers, now gone. The flanking towers are
    without loops, that to the left on entering is approached from the
    vault by a narrow doorway. If there was a drawbridge attached to this
    gate, its heel must have rested upon a large stone about 10 feet in
    advance and 6 feet below the level of the portal. The ditch at this
    point is nearly 100 feet broad, and 30 feet to 40 feet deep. It is
    evident that there were no bridge-piers of masonry in the ditch, so
    that the roadway probably rested on trestles.</p>

  <p>The opposite and lesser gateway is in the south wall, close to its west
    end, and flanked, therefore on one side by the south-western tower.
    It seems to have been a simple opening in the curtain, about 10 feet
    broad. It is now a mere breach, but the bar-holes remain. There is no
    sign of a portcullis. The approach to this gate came up along the edge
    of the ditch, between it and the wall, from the east, and was commanded
    by two loops in the curtain and by the south-eastern tower.</p>

  <p>The area of the court is quite clear of buildings, but a few heaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span> of
    rubbish show that it contained barrack buildings of timber, with stone
    basements, placed against the walls, which have been plastered. There
    is no trace of hall, chapel, kitchen, well, or permanent lodgings, and
    no ornament of any kind; no moulding, no mural chambers or garderobes,
    no staircase save in the great gatehouse, and only two small
    fireplaces, in the first and second floors of the north-eastern gate
    tower. The towers are not only bold and lofty, and about 60 feet high,
    but the outer half of their bases is carried many feet down the slope
    of the ditch, giving them great breadth of base, and a very substantial
    and massive character.</p>

  <p>The great barbican is a very remarkable work, not unlike a similar
    defence at Castle Rising, which there, however, is confined to an
    earthwork, whereas here the defences are both in earthwork and masonry.
    The work is irregular in its shape, concave where it rests upon the
    counterscarp of the main ditch,‚Äîon its other faces convex. In depth, or
    from north to south, it measures about 56 yards; in breadth, 74 yards.
    It is defended by a ditch of moderate dimensions, which communicates
    with the main ditch at each end, but is scarce a quarter of its depth.
    The curtain wall is very irregular in outline, the west side being made
    up of about four straight pans of masonry, meeting at various angles.
    The front is a long straight wall, and the east side, also straight,
    meets it at a right angle. The curtain of this outwork is about 5 feet
    thick, and from 15 feet to 18 feet high. Upon it are four mural towers;
    three, drum-shaped, are 10 feet in internal diameter, with entrances at
    the ground floor from the court. In height they rise a story above the
    curtain. They are looped to the field, have timber floors, and their
    staircases seem to have been of timber. One tower is angular, and has
    evidently been the kitchen, part of the oven and the outline of the
    large fireplace being still visible.</p>

  <p>The outer gatehouse is placed at the south-eastern corner of the
    barbican, terminating its wall and resting upon the counterscarp of the
    main ditch. It is of rude construction, composed of two solid masses
    or cheeks of wall, 46 feet long and 9 feet thick, rounded at the outer
    end. Most of the northern wall is gone, and with it the roof or vault
    of the entrance passage, and the details of the gateway. This sort of
    entrance between the high and long walls is found at Conisborough and
    Berkhampstead. The other or inner end of the barbican wall, at the
    south-west corner, ends abruptly, and probably descended a little way
    down the counterscarp of the main ditch, so as to prevent an entrance.
    In the wall is a recess 6 feet 4 inches broad and 3 feet deep, which
    may have been a public garderobe, similar to that in the wall of the
    middle ward of Corfe Castle.</p>

  <p>The lesser barbican covers the south entrance, the way to which does
    not, however, appear to have lain across it. It is of earth only,‚Äîthat
    is, has no walls, but is of great strength; in shape, and, indeed, in
    function, it is a lunette. Its diameter, in the direction from the
    gate outwards, is 20 yards, and its breadth 100 yards. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span> rests upon
    the counterscarp of the main ditch, here about 20 yards broad. It has,
    also, on its front and sides, a ditch of its own about 20 yards broad,
    and communicating with the main ditch. In parts this work seems to
    have been revetted. It was connected with the main work or body of the
    castle by a narrow bridge, which sprang from its eastern angle, and
    of which traces remain. There does not appear to have been any outer
    gatehouse at this end; probably the approach was by a boat across the
    ditch, or by a plank bridge upon trestles.</p>

  <p>Besides the above-described works there is another and much larger,
    though less strong, earthwork, which covers the whole east face of
    the castle, as well as the flanks of its barbicans. It is about 30
    yards broad, and outside the main ditch, on which it rests, and upon
    the ditches of the barbicans. It had also, towards the field, a ditch
    of its own, now converted into a hollow road. The approach to either
    gate of the castle, from the east, lay across this outwork, which was
    probably stoutly palisaded, and intended to give a moderately safe
    refuge to the peasantry and their cattle, during invasions from the
    Welsh.</p>

  <p>It is evident from the general design, position, and capacity of
    this castle, that it was not intended, like Caerphilly, for the
    accommodation of a great military baron, nor like Morlais or Castell
    Coch for a mere military port. Its central part is nothing but a
    fortified area, like Framlingham, at which place, however, there seems
    to have been, as at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Briavels, a keep. Here certainly there was
    none. It is and always was a mere shell, composed of a strong and lofty
    curtain, mural towers, and a gatehouse. There do not appear to have
    been any of the usual buildings contained within a large castle. The
    accommodation within the walls seems to have consisted in timber-sheds,
    resting on stone foundations, and built against the walls. In this way
    a very large number of soldiers might have been accommodated.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the capacity for lodging a large body of troops was not
    confined to the inner ward. The outworks are also spacious and strong,
    and could contain a small army, or the <i lang="fr">√©lite</i>, or perhaps
    the cavalry, of a large one, besides affording accommodation for a
    considerable herd and flock of cattle and sheep. Such a place would
    be secure against any ordinary inroad of the Welsh, and supported, as
    it would be, by the equally strong, though less capacious, castles of
    Grosmount and Skenfrith, not to mention Chepstow and Caerleon, which
    were not always in friendly hands, not only would the entrance of a
    Welsh army into Gwent be difficult, but its retreat, once within the
    line, would be almost impossible.</p>

  <p>As to the age of White Castle, it is difficult to speak positively.
    The earthworks are not at all of an English, still less of a Welsh,
    character. Nor, as a general rule, did the Normans ever throw up
    earthworks on so immense a scale. The masonry is probably of the age
    of John, or, perhaps, even of that of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, contemporary with
    Skenfrith, or perhaps a trifle later, and the earthworks may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span> of the
    same date. They are certainly designed to suit a castle in masonry,
    not the mere palisaded residence of a Mercian Thane. They do not at
    all resemble the earthworks connected with Offa‚Äôs Dyke, or those known
    to be the work of √Üthelfl√¶d or Eadweard. On the whole, it seems more
    probable that, looking to the extreme importance of the position, the
    early Norman invaders exceeded the usual character of their earthworks,
    and designed and executed those which are still seen.</p>

  <p>The name White Castle,‚Äîin Welsh, ‚ÄúCastell Gwyn,‚Äù‚Äîis said to be derived
    from Gwyn ap Gwaethvoed, a brother of the reputed founder of Skenfrith,
    and one of the Welsh lords of this district. If so, he must have held
    it during the troubles preceding and subsequent to the death of Harold,
    but any works that he may have found or thrown up were probably effaced
    by those of the present castle. The castle was held, with those of
    Grosmount and Skenfrith, sometimes by the De Breose family, sometimes
    by the Crown, and, finally, by the Dukes of Lancaster. No doubt it
    shared in the general neglect of the Border castles; that is, of such
    as were not the seat of any baronial family. In the time of James <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> it
    was a ruin, and had been so beyond the memory of man.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="WHITTINGTON_SHROPSHIRE">WHITTINGTON, SHROPSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">AMONG the baronial families which rose upon the ruins of the house of
    Montgomery, and wielded the fragments of that power, which, united
    in the hands of Earl Roger and Robert de Belesme, had proved so
    formidable, the lords of Clun, Oswaldestre, and Whittington, De Say,
    Fitz-Alan, and Fitz-Warine occupied, in the northern parts of the great
    earldom, and upon the borders of Wales, by much the chief place. De
    Say indeed, speedily, by an heiress, became absorbed in Fitz-Alan,
    and probably in the same convenient way, ‚Äú<span lang="la">Felix Austria nube</span>,‚Äù the
    broad lands of Peverel, merged in Fitz-Warine, so that the lords of
    Oswaldestre and Whittington held about co-equal rule in the Marches,
    and were alike exposed alternately to the encroachments of their
    sovereign on the one hand, and to the fiery assaults of the Welsh on
    the other‚Äîdangers which probably prevented them from turning their arms
    against one another, so that they remained vigorous and warlike for
    above two centuries, although the battlements of their castles were
    plainly visible, the one from the other, and scarce two miles apart.</p>

  <p>The position of Oswaldestre has already been described. Whittington
    lay about two miles to the north-east, and about four and a half
    miles within or to the east of Offa‚Äôs Dyke, while Watt‚Äôs Dyke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
    extended between them. The site of Whittington was probably selected
    as the centre of a fertile estate, rather than for any very striking
    military advantages, for the position is low and marshy‚Äîa feature of
    which, however, the ancient engineer largely and judiciously availed
    himself. By whom or when the original fortress was founded is utterly
    unknown. Certainly long before its occupation by those Norman invaders,
    who identified it with their fame. As, like Shrewsbury, Clun, and
    Oswaldestre, its keep was placed upon a moated mound, its origin, like
    theirs, may probably be attributed to the reign of Edward the Elder,
    or the earlier part of the tenth century, and to the fierce Mercian
    Saxons, who, as early as the middle of the seventh century, seem to
    have established themselves along the Welsh border.</p>

  <p>The central mound, which is the main feature of these and many ninth
    and tenth century fortresses, is here wholly artificial, about 30 feet
    in height, and about 150 feet by 100 feet diameter upon its rounded and
    table summit. At the foot of the mound is a ditch, from 40 feet to 60
    feet in breadth, and beyond this are three elevated platforms, as was
    not unusual. Of these, the first lies towards the north and east, and
    is also moated. Across it lay the principal entrance from the outer
    road, and to the keep. On the west side is a second platform, also
    moated, and in strength rivalling the keep mound itself. The third
    platform, far superior to these in area, and also moated, is placed
    beyond them, towards the north-west.</p>

  <p>The cluster of four islands, thus protected from the exterior and from
    each other, is covered to the south and west by three banks and three
    ditches, arranged concentrically, and including within their sweep
    about one-third of a great circle of eight hundred yards radius, within
    which figure, roughly triangular, is contained the castle. The defence
    upon the north and east was formed, not by banks and ditches, but by a
    broad expanse of what is still marshy ground, and must formerly have
    been an impassable morass. This tract was flooded by a small but rapid
    brook, which descends from the north-west, skirts the ends of the
    ditches of the castle, and supplied them also with water. At present
    the brook skirts the south edge of the old morass, and, running in
    front of the outer entrance, turns off to the south-east, probably
    again communicating with the ditches of the castle at their other or
    eastern end. The earthworks thus described, palisaded or even planted
    with a stout thorn hedge along the outer banks, would possess great
    strength. The ditches, probably, all contained water, and with the
    marsh would be only the more impassable were the water drained off and
    its area replaced by mud. What the Norman baron who obtained the estate
    found or supplied in the way of defences cannot now be ascertained. Of
    the masonry now remaining there is nothing which can be regarded as
    earlier than the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> This could scarcely have been the
    first masonry employed in the defences; and yet if walls and towers
    were built in the reigns of Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> and John, they would assuredly
    have been of a substantial and marked character, and would scarcely
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>have been removed either by time or the hand of man in the lapse of a
    century or a century and a half.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i_523.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">WHITTINGTON CASTLE‚ÄîGROUND PLAN.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The central mound has been scarped vertically, probably in the time of
    Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and is included within a revetment wall of great strength,
    and about 30 feet high. This seems to have been surmounted by a
    parapet, and to have been reinforced by a number of flanking towers,
    of which one and a part of two others remain. The most perfect is
    cylindrical, about 30 feet in diameter, with walls 10 feet thick. Its
    base is occupied by a circular pit, probably a dungeon; and, if so, a
    gloomy and damp one, not having a single loop or air-hole. The floor is
    a foot or two above the bottom level of the ditch, and the platform of
    timber covering it, the floor of the first story, was on a level with
    the top of the mound. This stage had two loops, cruciform, with the
    lower limb very long, and terminating in a dovetail. They are placed in
    large recesses, low-pointed. There was an upper floor, of which only
    fragments remain. The pit was probably reached by a ladder, for a door,
    seen in its base to the east, is an insertion. The first-floor door is
    represented by a breach on the south-west side. This tower flanked the
    inner gateway of the keep. Of the corresponding tower, to the west, a
    portion only remains. It was of the same size and shape, and between
    the two was a space of 12 feet, occupied by the gateway and drawbridge,
    of which the pit remains.</p>

  <p>A fragment of the base of a similar tower is seen at the south-west
    angle of the mound, and there were two, or perhaps three more, to the
    south-east and north-east; but this part of the work is concealed by
    loose earth and thick vegetation. Altogether, it appears that the
    keep was a mound, scarped or faced by a strong revetment wall, in a
    polygonal form, and capping each angle was a lofty round tower, rising
    out of the ditch. There is said to be a well in the south-west corner,
    but it is not now visible. From the inner gatehouse a bridge crossed
    the inner ditch, and landed upon the opposite bank, a few yards in
    the rear, or west of the outer gatehouse. This was a rectangular
    structure, having at its eastern or outer end two three-quarter drum
    towers, corresponding in size and workmanship with those flanking the
    inner, as do these the outer gateway. They are looped with cruciform
    and dove-tailed loops, and between them is a depressed pointed arch
    of plain pattern, chamfered, and with an exterior roll moulding.
    There is said to be an escutcheon in the wall above the gateway; but
    if so, it is concealed by ivy. Above is a corbel table, pierced with
    machicolations. The half of this gatehouse, south of the entrance
    passage, is tolerably perfect. It contains a chamber in the south
    wall, in which is a window of three lights, acutely pointed, under an
    acutely pointed head. The heads of the lights are cinquefoiled, and the
    apertures in the head quatrefoiled, the whole being late Decorated.
    This window is said to have been removed from the old parish church
    when ‚Äúrestored.‚Äù The northern half of the gatehouse is nearly all
    destroyed. There remains part of a curtain wall, passing southwards
    from the gatehouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span> to the edge of the ditch. A similar wall on the
    north side passes backwards along the edge of the ditch, and upon it
    are the remains of two round towers, connected with the gatehouse. What
    masonry remains is composed of large square blocks of red sandstone.
    The whole of the older part seems of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, and is,
    no doubt, Fitz-Warine work. There is little or no trace of masonry on
    the several platforms or banks, save that on one bank to the south-west
    is a mark of a revetment wall which may or may not be old. Probably the
    masonry was confined to the keep and barbican-like platform occupied by
    the outer gatehouse, which would include an area for a very sufficient
    garrison. The banks, like those at Berkhampstead, are narrow, and would
    scarcely have carried a wall. The ditches were all filled from the
    brook, with which they communicated at each end.</p>

  <p>The castle seems to have been laid out as a fancy garden a century or
    so ago, as there are traces of pebble-laid walks, and here and there
    modern brickwork. The church has been rebuilt early in the present
    century, and is altogether what might be expected. Recently some arches
    have been inserted in better taste in the Norman style. Mr. Lloyd, of
    Aston, is the lord of the manor and owner of the castle.</p>

  <p>Whittington occurs in Domesday as ‚ÄúWititone,‚Äù when Earl Roger de
    Montgomery held it, with seven and a half berewicks. King Edward had
    held it, but in his time it was waste. Ethelred, Edward‚Äôs father, had
    held it as three manors, which seem to have been Maesbury, Whittington,
    and Chirbury. In Earl Roger‚Äôs time it yielded ¬£15. 15<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> The berewicks
    are the later townships, comprising those of Welsh Frankton, Berghill,
    Daywell, Fernhill, Hindford, Henlle, Ebnall, and half of Old Marton.
    From Earl Roger, Whittington descended to Robert de Belesme, and,
    on his forfeiture, passed to Henry <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, who seems to have granted it
    to William Peverel of Dover, whose nephew, William Peverel, held it
    against Stephen in 1138. The second Peverel died childless. The last
    one of his co-heirs married Guarin de Metz, sheriff of Salop, in 1083,
    but the king seems to have resumed possession of the castle, and to
    have granted it, in 1164, to Geoffrey de Vere, who married Isabel de
    Say of Clun. Next year, 1165, Henry resumed it, and granted it to Roger
    de Powys, a Welshman, who held office in South Wales. He was also
    custos of the Fitz-Alan Castle of ‚ÄúDernio,‚Äù which Mr. Eyton takes to be
    Edeyrneon Castle, in Merioneth. In 1173 Roger was allowed aid for its
    repairs. Meredith, son of Roger, succeeded, and was followed by Meyric,
    Meredith‚Äôs brother, who died about 1200. He was called Meyric de Powys
    of Wales, and paid fifty marcs to King John to have Whittington and
    Overton. The Powys tenure was that of ‚Äúking‚Äôs messenger in Wales.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The Fitz-Warines seem always to have kept alive their claim from their
    ancestor Guarin, though Wrenoc, son of Meyric, succeeded, and paid
    eighty marcs to John for the villages and castles of Whittington and
    Overton, but Fulk Fitz-Warine seems to have obtained the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span> castle from
    the Prince of Wales, which John at first resented, but finally, in
    1204, confirmed to Fulk, as his ‚Äúright and heritage,‚Äù when he paid
    200 marcs and two ‚Äúdestriers,‚Äù and gained a judicial decision in
    his favour. 5 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> he had licence to fortify the castle. The
    Fitz-Warines continued to hold the castle and manor until the failure
    of their elder male line, by the death of Fulk, the eleventh lord, in
    1420. The Hospitallers held a manor in Whittington by the service of
    finding a chaplain for the chapel of the castle.</p>

  <p>A little before 7 Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, Prince Llewelyn laid siege to the castle,
    and it sustained a severe attack from the Welsh on the Friday preceding
    Midsummer, 6 Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr> It appeared, from an inquiry dated 1 Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>,
    that Richard <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> had granted the castle, pending the minority of Fulk
    Fitz-Warine, to Yvion Fitz-Warine, who sold the wardship to Elizabeth,
    Lady Botreaux, a daughter of Sir Ralph d‚ÄôAubigny, and she held it when
    attacked. Probably she expected the attack to be repeated, for, on the
    Sunday after Midsummer, Thomas, Earl of Arundel, with soldiers from
    Oswaldestre, took charge. Elizabeth resigned her wardship to William de
    Clinton and Anne, his wife, and her daughter.</p>

  <p>It is much to be desired that some person resident in this most
    interesting district would take up the subject of its earthworks, of
    which there are many of all ages, and some not set down in the Ordnance
    map. Many of the earthworks are so placed, with regard to Offa‚Äôs and
    Watt‚Äôs Dykes, as to show whether they are of earlier date or subsequent
    to those lines.</p>

  <p>Among the most curious of these earthworks is one within the domain
    of Porkington, and which bears its ancient name of Brogyntyn. It is
    a regular circle, 50 yards or so across, contained within a bank of
    earth, about 4 feet to 6 feet high, outside of which is a ditch. The
    central area has been levelled for a bowling-green, but was, no doubt,
    always flat, and although a drift has been driven across and below the
    circle, and the ditch is planted and contains a modern walk, there is
    no reason to suppose that the character of the work has been materially
    altered. In Ireland it would be called a rath; but in Ireland it would
    not crown a rather steep eminence, but be placed in the midst of land
    that might readily be cultivated, which this could not. It is pretty
    clear that its figure is intentionally and not incidentally a circle,
    by no means often the case with Welsh camps.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="WIGMORE_HEREFORDSHIRE">WIGMORE, HEREFORDSHIRE.</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Castle of Wigmore, the head of the Hundred and Honour of that
    name, the chief seat of the great House of Mortimer, and the centre
    of that territorial power which made its lords so formidable to their
    sovereigns, and at last brought about their fall, stands in the
    north-west corner of the border shire of Hereford, and about eight
    miles on the English side of Offa‚Äôs Dyke. It is one of a chain of
    strongholds of which Clun, Hopton, and Brampton Bryan, lay to its
    immediate north, and Lingen and Lyons Hall to its south; while in its
    rear were posted Croft and Richard‚Äôs Castle, assuring to its garrison
    a speedy communication with the great central fortresses of Ludlow and
    Shrewsbury.</p>

  <p>Most of these castles are of ancient date, and their earthworks testify
    to the intensity and permanence of the struggle maintained by the Welsh
    against the encroachments of the colony planted by the English in the
    latter part of the eighth century, and protected by the mighty work
    which still bears the name of Offa. These traces of the footsteps of
    the invader from beyond the Severn may still be observed along the
    frontier marches of the Principality from Cardiff to Hawarden, posted
    wherever the valleys laid open the interior of the country; nor along
    the whole line is there a grander or stronger military work than that
    for which Wigmore was celebrated long before the Normans crossed the
    Channel.</p>

  <p>But the military virtues, if not triumphs, of the Welsh, identified
    with this district, ascend to a period before even the common
    ancestors of Englishmen and Normans appeared in Britain, and were
    exercised, though equally in vain, against even a greater foe. The
    great British hill camps of Coxwall-Knoll, Caer Caradoc, Brandon, and
    Croft-Ambrey, are thought to be evidences of the fierce struggles
    of the Britons against the Roman legions, though with how little
    ultimate success against either Roman or Englishman, the parallel lines
    of Watling-street and the Dyke still give silent but overpowering
    testimony.</p>

  <p>Wigmore, an English creation, bears an English name. It is first
    mentioned in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 921, when the Saxon Chronicle relates that
    King Eadweard, in the Rogation days, that is about the 7th of May,
    ‚Äúcommanded the burh at Wisingamere to be built.‚Äù That this command was
    very rapidly as well as very completely obeyed, is clear from the fact,
    stated by the same authority, that, in the same year, probably at the
    commencement of autumn, the Danes with a great army laid siege to the
    new burh, ‚Äúbeset it round about, and fought against it far in the day,
    and took the cattle about it; and, nevertheless, the men defended the
    burh who were therein, and then they (the Danes) abandoned the burh
    and went away.‚Äù A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span> strong place which was constructed in five months
    could not have been a work in masonry, and scarcely in dry walling;
    but with a proper force of men the earthworks of the mound and inner
    area might have been executed in that time. But earthworks alone would
    not have held an army of active Danes at bay. The slopes must have
    been strengthened with palisades, so as to protect the garrison and
    enable them to keep the enemy at a moderate distance. Fire was scarcely
    practicable, as the wood employed must have been green. Moreover,
    however hard Edward‚Äôs soldiers may have worked, it is scarcely probable
    that they could have done more than throw up the burh proper, or
    mound, and the banks containing the smaller area attached to it, or
    have prepared palisades for a larger front, even if formed. We are
    told that when Queen √Üthelfl√¶d‚Äôs warriors, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 916, took
    Brecenanmere, or Brecknock, by storm, they captured there the king‚Äôs
    wife, with thirty-four persons. The Burh of Brecknock, therefore, held
    probably but a small garrison: and its mound and inner circle, the
    parts, no doubt, then defended, are not, in point of size, greater than
    those of Wigmore, for which certainly one hundred and fifty to two
    hundred men would form, for a short time, a sufficient garrison. It
    was, then, to the passive strength of this position, and to its narrow
    front, that they owed their safety. The cattle taken probably pastured
    at the foot of the mound and upper area, within what is now the lower
    ward of the Castle, then, no doubt, but slightly protected.</p>

  <p>Of the Lords of Wigmore during the century following the Danish attack,
    nothing is recorded, but the castle is named in Domesday, Ralph de
    Mortimer then held Wighemore. Edward had held it. There was half a hyde
    there, within which was the castle. Ralph held the castle. William the
    Earl (of Hereford) made it on the waste land called Merestun, which
    Gunnent held in the time of King Edward. There were two hydes geldable.
    Ralph had in demesne two plough-lands and four serfs. The burh there
    paid seven pounds. No doubt the earlier castle had been destroyed, that
    is, the destructible part of it, and William Fitz Osbern had restored
    it. That earl had been active in subduing the Welsh insurrection of
    1068‚Äì9, and in reward for the services of Ralph de Mortimer on this
    occasion, and in putting down Edric the Forester, he had the grant
    recorded in Domesday. Dugdale says that he actually besieged Edric in
    the castle and took it, and thus laid the foundation of the greatness
    of his family as Lords of the March; but though Ralph de Mortimer put
    down Edric, there is no evidence that the latter ever owned or held out Wigmore.</p>

  <p>The possession of so strong a country, and at the same time of so
    exposed a frontier, was the secret of the Marcher independence. It was
    a dangerous power, often selfishly exercised, inasmuch as the lords
    combined frequently with the public enemy to gain their private ends
    against the sovereign. At all times, also, it stood in the way of an
    equal administration of justice, and much retarded the consolidation of
    the empire.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span></p>

  <p>Happily for the greatness of England, Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> not only saw this,
    but on coming to the crown made that consolidation his earliest care.
    He saw that so long as Wales remained an insurrectionary power, so
    long would the Marchers be independent, and not to be relied upon as
    subjects; and with that bold sagacity which marked his character, he
    proceeded, not merely to put down insurrection as it rose, but to cut
    off its root. This he attained in 1276‚Äì1282, by the destruction of
    Llewelyn and the erection of the castles of Flint, Denbigh, Ruthin,
    Conway, Beaumaris, Caernarvon, and Harlech, and the restoration or
    recovery of those of Hawarden, Rhuddlan, Eulo, Chirk, Bere, Dinas Br√¢n,
    the tower of Dolbadarn, and some others.</p>

  <p>Next, as occasion served, he reduced the Marcher prerogatives, of which
    a very memorable instance occurred about 1292, when he took advantage
    of a petty war between De Clare and De Bohun, on the borders of
    Morganwg, to confiscate the estates of both, which he then regranted,
    withholding their most objectionable privileges. At the same time, by
    engaging in the Scottish wars, he both drew from Wales her best men and
    employed them in the service of England and opened to the Marchers a
    safe field for their military prowess.</p>

  <p>Ralph, the first English Mortimer, died seized of above one hundred and
    thirty manors, of which sixty-nine lay in Hereford and Salop. Hugh, his
    son, held also the castles of Cleobury and Bridgenorth, and was active
    in opposition to Henry <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, who laid siege at once to his three castles
    and so brought him to terms. He died in penitence as a canon of Wigmore
    abbey in 1185, having confirmed and much augmented his father‚Äôs grants
    thereto. He was buried before the high altar. Lord Hugh is reputed
    to have built the castles of Caermarthen, Mapudrith, and Cymaron,
    whichever those latter may be, in South Wales, and therefore may well
    have been the author of the Norman work still to be traced around the
    outer ward of Wigmore.</p>

  <p>Roger, his son, seems to have found full employment in keeping down the
    Welsh. He died 1215, and was succeeded by his son Hugh.</p>

  <p>Hugh, the fourth lord, adhered to King John. In his time Llewelyn
    attended a conference at Wigmore. He held for the king the castles of
    Stratton-dale and Holgot in Salop. He died from wounds received in a
    tournament, 1227; and was succeeded by his brother.</p>

  <p>Ralph, fifth lord, flourished in the first half of the reign of Henry
    <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, very turbulent on the Marches. He built, in Melenydd, the castles
    of Keventles and Knoclas, and to them added a social strength, marrying
    dark Gwladys, Llewelyn‚Äôs daughter, widow of Reginald de Braose. He died
    1246.</p>

  <p>Roger, his son, sixth lord, took a lead in Welsh affairs, but with no
    great success. Llewelyn took four of his castles, Melenydd, Keventles,
    Radnor, and another. He adhered to Henry, fought at Northampton, and
    had to flee from Lewes. He aided in the flight of Prince Edward from
    Hereford, brought him to Wigmore, had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span> command at Evesham, and for
    his services received the forfeited estates of the earldom of Oxford,
    opposing on that account the wise restoration proposed by the Dictum
    de Kenilworth. It was he who at that celebrated castle held the famous
    tournament, in honour of which the great gatehouse, it is thought,
    gained its name of Mortimer Tower. It has been supposed that he rebuilt
    the castle of Wigmore, but most of the work now seen seems of a rather
    later date. He died in 1282‚Äì3, and, said his epitaph at Wigmore‚Äî</p>

  <div class="center-container">

  </div>

  <p>Edmund, seventh lord, eldest surviving son, succeeded, and commenced
    his career by attacking the Welsh at Builth, and receiving and
    transmitting Llewelyn‚Äôs head to the king. As some suspicion attached
    to his loyalty owing to his Welsh blood, he was particularly active in
    quelling the disturbances that followed on the death of the prince, and
    it was in putting down one of them in 1303‚Äì4, also at Builth, that he
    received a wound of which he soon after died at Wigmore.</p>

  <p>Roger, eighth lord, styled Lord Mortimer of Wigmore, created Earl of
    March in 1328; served both in Ireland and Scotland. He was governor of
    Builth Castle, took Cardiff from Hugh le Despenser, and had a grant of
    Clun. He joined the party of Thomas of Lancaster against Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    had a narrow escape for his life while in prison, and in gratitude
    built <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter‚Äôs Chapel in the outer ward of Ludlow Castle. In 1322,
    after the battle of Boroughbridge, he fled to France, and the king
    seized on Wigmore, causing an inventory to be drawn up of its contents
    by John de Cherleton, the keeper. There were springholds, the artillery
    of the age, cross-bows, English and Oriental armour and weapons, a
    chess-board and a board for talles and draughts, five peacocks in the
    courtyard, and grain and cattle in quantity. On the earl‚Äôs return,
    followed his intimacy with the ‚Äúshe-wolf of France,‚Äù his acquisition
    of a prodigious number of manors in England, Wales, and Ireland; his
    seizure at Nottingham Castle, his attainder, and his execution by
    hanging in 1330. It seems probable that this lord rebuilt the castle,
    superseding the Norman work by that, in the Decorated style, which
    still remains.</p>

  <p>Edmund, his son, did not recover the earldom. He died young, a few
    months after his father, in 1331, leaving a son, a minor.</p>

  <p>Roger, tenth lord, who succeeded, had livery of Wigmore Castle before
    he came of age. He obtained the reversal of the attainder and the
    restoration of the earldom of March in 1352. He served Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> in
    France, recovered much of the Welsh property, including Ludlow and
    other estates coming by his grandmother, the heiress of Genville;
    and finally died 1360, being then commander of the English forces in
    Burgundy.</p>

  <p>Edmund, eleventh lord and third Earl of March, his son, succeeded. His
    abilities were early turned to account by Edward, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span> employed him
    while under age in negotiating a peace with France, and afterwards as
    Lieutenant of Ireland. He married Philippa, heiress of Lionel, Duke of
    Clarence, and thus maintained the ancient honours and influence of his
    name. He died at Cork 1381.</p>

  <p>Roger, his eldest son, became fourth Earl of March. He was by Richard
    <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> made Lieutenant of Ireland, and by descent from the Duke of
    Clarence declared heir of the Crown. His service was entirely in
    Ireland, where he was slain. He was followed by Edmund, his son.</p>

  <p>Edmund, fifth and last Earl of March, was regarded with excessive
    jealousy by Henry <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, as heir to the throne, and was kept, during his
    reign, under surveillance. Henry <abbr title="5th">V.</abbr>, however, employed him in Normandy,
    and in the next reign he, like his immediate forefathers, became
    Lieutenant of Ireland. He died 1425, aged twenty-four years, and with
    him ended the male line of Mortimer of Wigmore.</p>

  <p>Among the castles returned as held by him, at his death, in the
    Marches, were Blaenlevenny, Builth, Clifford, Dinas by Talgarth,
    Dolveren, Denbigh, Knoclas, Kevenles, Ludlow, Montgomery, Norton,
    Nerberth, Raidrey, Radnor, Usk, and Wigmore.</p>

  <p>Richard, Duke of York, as his sister‚Äôs son, was heir of the vast
    estates of the Mortimers, and transmitted them to his son, Edward
    <abbr title="4th">IV.</abbr>, when all became merged in the Crown. It was from the Honour of
    Wigmore that Edward raised most of the power that enabled him to defeat
    Owen Tudor at no great distance from the castle, and still nearer to
    Mortimer‚Äôs Cross. The castle remained in the Crown till granted away
    by Elizabeth. In 1601 it was purchased by Thomas Harley, and in 1643
    dismantled by the Parliamentary forces, since which it has been a
    gradually diminishing ruin.</p>

  <h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>

  <p>The tract of high and wooded land which lies towards the Radnorshire
    border, between the waters of the Teme and the Lugg, converges and
    descends towards the east until it forms a long spit or spur of rock
    which terminates in the knoll now occupied by the parish church of
    Wigmore. This ridge‚Äîstraight, steep, and well defined‚Äîis bounded on
    the south by a narrow valley, down which descends a brook from the
    high ground of Wigmore Rolls, to fall, just below the church, into the
    Allcox brook. To the north the ridge is still more strongly protected
    by the broad expanse that probably gave its termination to the name
    of the place, and is still called, by reduplication, Wigmore moor
    and lake, and Leinthal lake; formerly, as their names import, watery
    tracts, and which are still alternately drained and flooded by the
    united channels of the Clun and the Teme on their way to Ludlow.</p>

  <p>Low on the ridge, and astride upon and occupying its whole breadth, is
    what remains of the castle. Those who selected the spot were attracted
    by an immense depression, clear, sharp, and steep, as if cut by art,
    which here traverses the ridge, and cuts off its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span> eastern portion from
    the higher and broader ground to the west. Upon the eastern verge of
    this ravine is piled up a mound of earth, in form conical and about
    30 feet high, above its rocky base, though 100 feet or more above the
    bottom of the ravine. The mound is about 30 feet diameter at its flat
    top. It is probable that when this was formed the natural ravine was
    slightly deepened, and on the near side rendered steeper by art.</p>

  <p>Close east of the mound, and above 40 feet below its top, is a roughly
    oval area, about 100 feet east and west by 50 feet north and south,
    encircled by a bank of earth, outside of which was a ditch, which
    included also the mound, and was probably the work thrown up by King
    Edward, and so gallantly held against the Danes. It is very strong,
    the ground falling away steeply on every side, and especially to the
    north and west. Upon the mound stood the Norman shell keep; the oval
    contained within a wall, most of which remains, was the inner ward. The
    mound and its appended oval stood within, and partly on the edge of a
    far larger area, which included the slopes, and extended nearly to the
    base of the hill towards the south and south-east, and on those sides
    protected the citadel. Towards the north and the west the steepness of
    the ground rendered a second line of defence unnecessary, and the mound
    and its oval formed there a part of the outer <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>. This
    second area was also covered by a ditch which descended from the south
    side of the mound, and from the north-east part of the oval, and thus
    formed the outer ward of the castle, in which probably were pastured
    the cattle driven off by the Danes. The Normans enclosed this also
    within a wall. This ward was covered by a deep and wide ditch, wholly
    artificial; and this, again, at one point, by a second ditch across
    the ridge, towards the south. Within the outer ward, attached to the
    southern and south-eastern slope of the inner ward, was an enclosure of
    moderate area, taken, of course, out of the outer ward. The earthworks
    of this are slight, and it seems to be wholly of Norman origin, and
    intended as a middle ward.</p>

  <p>Thus, then, the original work was composed of a mound with a deep
    ravine to its west, and placed on the edge of, and in part within, an
    oval area on its east, the whole encircled by a common ditch. Then,
    as the mound stood on the edge of the inner ward, so the mound and
    inner ward together stood on the edge of the outer ward, which covered
    them to the south and east, and included an area strong indeed, but
    which required a considerable garrison to defend it. The outermost and
    partial ditch, as well as the middle ward, were probably later works.</p>

  <p>The Norman who first took possession of these formidable works
    evidently laid his additions upon the English lines, either he or
    his successor superseding the timber palisades by walls of masonry.
    Upon the summit of the mound he built, as the foundations still show,
    a circular or polygonal tower as a keep. From thence a curtain wall
    sprang from its opposite sides and encircled the small eastern area,
    forming the inner ward. The wall was so placed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span> it became a
    revetment to the old bank, which thus took a place as a sort of ramp
    within the area. The apex of the area, that is, the end opposite to
    the mound, was capped by what appears to have been a round tower, of
    which only a heap of ruin remains. North of this, the curtain, which
    was the outer wall, is still seen to be of considerable strength. What
    remains is about 6 feet thick and 30 feet high, and is strengthened
    outside by a square mural buttress, or bastion. To the south a large
    window-opening and some cross-walls indicate a domestic building. At
    the south-west angle, next to the mound, is a fragment of a lofty
    tower containing a well-stair. This marks the junction of one end of
    the outer curtain with the wall of the inner ward, as the ruined round
    tower does of its other end. Near this, in the south wall, much choked
    with rubbish, is an opening with a low, pointed arch, once the gateway
    between the inner and the outer ward, and which, combined with various
    indications to be observed in the remaining fragments of the curtain
    and its tower, shows that, whatever may have been the Norman defences
    of this ward, they were removed and replaced by what is now seen in the
    Decorated period.</p>

  <p>The tower, of which a tall fragment remains on the south-western side
    of the inner ward, marks the point of junction between the wall of
    that ward, the keep, and the wall of the outer ward. This latter wall,
    descending the steep natural slope, protects the inner ward gate from
    the west, and shows what appears to have been a postern, and beyond
    it a rectangular mural tower of bold projection, and marked outside
    by a bold cordon above its base. This is evidently an original Norman
    tower. Beyond it, being the southern wall of the ward, the Norman work
    is distinctly seen. The wall was in process of being rebuilt, and its
    imperfect junction with the new work is apparent. Of this later date is
    a curious large rectangular building, on the wall, of bold projection,
    and divided by a cross-wall into an eastern and a western chamber. It
    was of two floors, and below them a basement which has been vaulted
    over and fitted with exterior steps and doorways in the Perpendicular
    period. The building itself is early and excellent Decorated, as shown
    especially by the form and detail of a pair of two-light windows.
    From this tower the curtain, of the same date, extends to the great
    gatehouse which is to the south-east. This is much broken. It is
    rectangular, with a portal-vault below and two chambers above; one for
    the working of the outer, and one for that of the inner portcullis.
    The rib of the central portal remains, with a drop-arch and a square
    portcullis groove. In the inner chamber is seen part of a large
    fireplace with a good Decorated hood. Only one portal-arch remains, but
    from its position it is pretty clear that there were three. The archway
    is much choked with rubbish. From the great gatehouse the curtain
    curves sharply towards the north, enclosing the east face of the ward.
    Upon it is a bold half-round tower, of which the lower part, well seen
    from the ditch, and probably solid, is very perfect. It rises only to
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span> level of the ward. Thence the curtain turns the north-east corner
    of the ward to the remains of a polygonal tower, or more probably
    a square tower with the angles boldly chamfered; and from this it
    ascended the slope so as to join the inner ward at its north-east
    angle, where the traces have been mentioned of a large and probably
    round tower; and thus is completed the circuit of the outer ward.</p>

  <p>The middle ward is less easily traced. It seems to have been concentric
    with the outer ward; like it, appended to the south-east face of the
    inner ward, but of much smaller area, and much of that area occupied by
    the steep hill-side.</p>

  <p>The most considerable remains of its wall are towards the south-east,
    and it probably had, on this side, a ditch of its own. The hall and
    other of the domestic buildings seem to have stood here, on the level
    part, judging from the very rude outline of the foundations.</p>

  <p>Besides these defences, along the east front of the works of the outer
    ward is a second ditch, carried across the ridge, here very low.
    Between the two ditches is a platform of no great breadth, the rear of
    which forms the counterscarp of the outer ward ditch, while the front
    is scarped into three solid half-round bastions of earth, the outline
    of which is followed by the counterscarp of the outer ditch. The figure
    of this earthwork and the freshness of the cutting show that the whole
    is a late addition, probably by the latter Mortimers, to cover the foot
    of the outer wall, and, no doubt, strongly palisaded. Again, in advance
    about a hundred yards on this front, and lower down the hill, a deep
    ditch has been cut across the ridge, and its contents thrown inwards as
    a high and steep bank. Again, in advance of this line of defence, the
    hill, for 60 yards or 70 yards, is scarred with other earthworks of an
    uncertain and subordinate character and purpose, but evidently old.</p>

  <p>A good deal of masonry remains standing in various parts of the castle
    area, and, no doubt, the main foundations of the whole fortress could,
    with a little labour, be exposed. Although most of this masonry is of
    Decorated date, there is evidence that a good deal of it is built upon
    the Norman outlines; and probably, if search were made, a good deal of
    buried Norman work would be exposed; and it would be shown, as indeed
    it now is, to some extent, that the Norman castle covered pretty much
    the area of the present works.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the Norman tower and wall above mentioned,
    the masonry above ground seems of Decorated date and of excellent
    character. Enough remains to show, that with the slight exceptions
    already mentioned, the whole castle was rebuilt in the Decorated period
    in the earlier part of the fourteenth century. The work is of a very
    substantial character, and the appearance of the castle when complete,
    with its large <i lang="fr">enceinte</i>, deep ditches, and lofty inner ward and
    keep, must have been grand. The main approach lay from the east. The
    road branched off from the Watling-street and was carried along the
    south side of the ridge, between the high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span> ground and the brook, on a
    sort of shelf commanded by the works along the ridge.</p>

  <p>It is evident that the earliest fortress was confined to the mound and
    the small area immediately attached to it, but that the defences of the
    outer area were speedily added to provide space for flocks, herds, and
    herdsmen, and a sufficient garrison. The defences, in so thickly wooded
    a country, would probably be of timber.</p>

  <p>Whether the earliest Norman lord erected works in masonry is doubtful;
    probably not. Probably these were added by his successor at the end of
    the eleventh or early in the twelfth century. So protected it must have
    been very nearly impregnable. The walls of the keep and inner ward were
    quite out of the reach of any catapult, ram, or temporary wooden tower,
    owing to the steepness of the ground outside. Probably also the wet
    character of the low ground to the north and south would effectually
    cover these fronts, as the ravine would the west front. To the east the
    ground was firm and the country around open, but here the artificer‚Äôs
    defences were multiplied.</p>

  <p>The parish church was no doubt built by the Mortimers, though it
    contains no record of them either in tombs, arms, or inscriptions. It
    is of large size, and much of the north wall of the nave at its west
    end is of herring-bone masonry, and an unusually extensive example
    of it. The opposite or south wall, though faced inside and out with
    modern plaster, exhibits, high up, a Norman loop, and is evidently of
    the same, rather early Norman date. It is curious that a rural church
    of the Norman period should have been laid out with walls so high and
    a span so considerable. Possibly this was intended for the seat of the
    religious house which Ralph, the first Mortimer, founded before his
    death, and which was known as Wigmore Abbey.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">NO man of English race, at all acquainted with the history of his
    country, can enter the city of York without feeling something of
    that respect for a glorious past of which all men are more or less
    conscious, and which in the higher and nobler sort acts as an
    incentive to greatness both in thought and deed. It may, indeed, be
    that those who dwell within the city, or have been familiar with it
    from childhood, are less conscious of this feeling than those who
    visit it as strangers, and to whom the noble river, ancient walls,
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span> venerable minster, stand out unassociated with the concerns of
    every-day life; but, on the other hand, the men of York cannot but feel
    for their birthplace something of the love of children for a parent,
    something of the pride of citizens of no mean city, something of that
    secret charm by which every man, worthy of the name, is attracted
    to his native land. Not London itself, the capital of the empire;
    not Canterbury, the seat of that other Metropolitan of our National
    Church, call up more varied or more brilliant recollections than are
    inseparably associated with the name and title of York; associated with
    the fortunes of that great branch of the House of Plantagenet, which,
    though without success, yet with so steady a persistence, contested the
    Crown of England.</p>

  <p class="noindent">for the name of the city evokes a long train of the best and noblest of
    the land, who, during the Wars of the Roses, staked life and fortune
    upon the House of York; nor, within the four seas of Britain, is there
    found a city which combines with so flourishing a present so many
    memorials of the past, so much still visible to the eye, so intimately
    connected with those centuries during which the English name and
    nation was being built up. No man can unfold a map of the Northumbrian
    territory, nor penetrate into its recesses, without observing how
    copious are the traces of our Scandinavian ancestors. Those names</p>

  <p class="noindent">are still vocal in our ears, and intelligible to our understandings.
    They speak to us with no uncertain sound of those hardy mariners who
    crossed the German Ocean in search of prey, and whose long ships
    were known and dreaded in every creek and upon every river along the
    seaboard of Britain. Saxons and Danes, Jutes and Angles, each and all
    have left their traces over the broad plain of York, traces of those
    long and bloody struggles during which these not remote kinsmen were
    becoming fused and welded into the Englishman. No Englishman, and
    most of all no Yorkshireman, can forget that it is neither from the
    native Briton nor from the Roman colonist, but from these Teuton and
    Scandinavian sea-kings, fierce and lawless as they were, that we derive
    all those qualities that have made England a great nation. The history
    of York, indeed, and of the material defences by which it is still
    surrounded, is older by some centuries than the history of England
    and the English people; and long before we arrive at the times of
    the Scandinavian invaders, we have to deal with the remains of these
    masters of the world, under whom this city rose to be what its own
    historian has pronounced it, ‚Äúa second Rome;‚Äù the mart and ‚Äúemporium of
    the common produce both of sea and land.‚Äù</p>

  <p>The history of the metropolis of northern England begins with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
    Roman occupation. When, however, the Romans called this station
    Eboracum, they evidently did not, as in Colonia or Confluentes,
    employ a new and altogether Latin name, but as in Mediolanum Isca, or
    Durolipons, they Latinised one already in use and of native origin.
    Until recently, strange as it may appear, this was the only positive
    argument, and it was a strong one, in favour of the pre-Roman existence
    of the city. Recently, however, researches into the sepulchres around
    the city have discovered undoubted British burials below those of
    the English and the Romans; and thus, in the opinion of Mr. Raine,
    have established the existence of an early British settlement. This
    discovery, probably, stands alone. No earthwork of distinctly British
    origin is found within or near the city, nor, indeed, save the ancient
    river, is there near at hand any physical feature of the country
    bearing a decidedly British name. No part of the great earthworks by
    which the city is girt can be attributed to the Brigantes. Though not
    all of one date, they all evidently belong to ages more advanced, and
    to a class of works very different from those found scattered along
    the crests of hills, and usually retaining, even now, their Celtic
    appellations. C√¶sar tells us, when writing of Verulam, that the British
    towns were strong earthworks in a wood, and such we may suppose to have
    been the Caer-Evrawc found and taken possession of by the Romans, and
    out of the name of which they constructed Eboracum. Much, and mainly
    of an unsatisfactory character, has been written upon the etymology of
    this, the earliest name of the city. It seems generally to be thought
    to be connected with the name Eure, now confined to the great river of
    Yorkshire, above Boroughbridge, but which formerly, it is suggested,
    may have been borne by the whole stream upon which Caer-Evrawc was
    situated. But, however this may be, and whether the Roman settlement
    was by foundation or by adoption, the actual site of York is worthy of
    a people who proposed to take and hold the country, and to maintain
    it under law and in order. Central in position, it stands upon a
    river navigable to the sea, and while the country around was open
    and admitted of being intersected by roads in every direction, the
    city itself was protected on one part by a broad and deep river, and
    on another by a stream which, though of less volume, traversed and
    saturated a track of marshy and impracticable country. It was evidently
    to the confluence and character of these two streams, now known as
    the Ouse and the Foss, that York owes its origin. The Roman station
    occupied a tolerably level platform, from 25 feet to 30 feet above the
    Ouse, and about 100 yards from its left or eastern bank. Sometimes, as
    at Leicester, these stations, when near a river, were extended to its
    actual edge, and the water became the defence on that side, but here,
    the river being navigable, that plan would have been unsafe, and a
    space was left between the fortified area or camp and the river. The
    precise date of the Roman settlement on the Ouse is unknown. Of the
    early generals C√¶sar probably penetrated but little beyond the Thames,
    or at most to the crest of the Chilterns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span> Aulus Plautius, Claudian,
    Vespasian, and Ostorius Scapula, were engaged chiefly in subduing
    the north and west, the last extending into the midland territory
    and probably reaching the Humber, where, and in the country of the
    Brigantes, Suetonius Paulinus probably made a settlement. Agricola,
    who landed in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 78, and retired finally <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 85,
    completed the conquest of North Britain, and probably established a
    permanent camp at York. Of course, such a post would be, at first, a
    mere slight earthwork, set out in the Roman fashion, and protected with
    palisades and by the discipline of the garrison. Of this first camp
    nothing is to be distinguished; but it is probable that when it was
    superseded by a walled station the new defences were built upon the old
    lines, where they are still to be seen or traced. By whom the Roman
    walls were originally built is unknown, probably during the second
    campaign of Agricola, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 79, after the complete subjugation
    of the Brigantes, and in connexion with the great military roads, of
    which four radiated from the city, and communicated afterwards with a
    whole network of subordinate or cross ways, many of which are still in
    use. Between the times of Hadrian, who landed <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 120, and
    built the Northumbrian wall from sea to sea; of Lollius Urbicus, who
    twenty years later connected in a similar manner the Firth of Forth
    and the Clyde, and Severus, who, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 207, re-asserted the
    Roman power, and reinforced the wall of Hadrian, the country became
    populous and rich, many walled stations and connected cities had been
    founded, and the remains of Roman houses scattered far and wide over
    the country attest its prosperity and internal peace. Ptolemy, writing
    in the second century, mentions Eboracum as the head-quarters of the
    6th Legion, as also is shown by many local inscriptions. It became
    rapidly a large city, ‚ÄúAltera Roma,‚Äù the capital of the North; and from
    the time of Severus to that of Constantine, both of whom died at York,
    it was the seat of the Government of Britain, and the head-quarters
    of the great military power maintained there. It was the chief of the
    twenty-eight Romano-British cities, and of the two which alone bore the
    title of Municipium.</p>

  <p>The fortress, or military part of the Roman city, was confined to the
    left bank of the river. The suburbs crossed the Ouse, and were widely
    extended to the south-west and north. The walled enclosure measured
    469 yards north-west and south-east, or up and down the stream, and
    550 yards in the direction at right angles. There were four principal
    gates; those to the north-east and south-west in the centre of their
    respective sides, those to the north-west and south-east somewhat to
    the south of, or nearer to, the river than the centre. But it is to be
    remarked that as the former gates, being in the centre, were 234 yards
    from each angle, so the latter was also 234 yards from the angles to
    the south. This looks as though the original walled area had been a
    square of 468 yards, and that afterwards, when the buildings became
    of a permanent character, and the lines of the great roads leading
    up to the gates were fixed by habitations along them, it was found
    necessary to enlarge the area, and that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span> was done by adding a
    breadth of 82 yards on the northern side, which would of course throw
    the north-west and south-east entrances by that much out of centre.
    If, moreover, we suppose the whole area wall to have been rebuilt
    when this supposed alteration was made, we shall have an explanation
    of the modern character of the extant masonry, which is held by
    those conversant with Roman work to be of a late period. If this be
    so, it is exceedingly probable that the whole <i lang="fr">enceinte</i> was
    then rebuilt, for so important a city would scarcely have been left
    unwalled during the earlier centuries of its prosperity. Considering
    the magnitude, population, and wealth of Roman York, and the number of
    public buildings which must necessarily have accumulated during the
    four hundred years which elapsed from the conquest by Claudian to the
    end of the Roman rule, and the presence of some of which is attested
    by inscriptions and foundations, it is remarked how very few monuments
    of the period remain above ground, or rather how completely the whole,
    with one or two exceptions, have disappeared. No doubt, under the 15
    feet or 16 feet of <i lang="fr">d√©bris</i> which are supposed to cover up the
    Roman city, and the equal depth of later soil which seems to have
    accumulated since the commencement of the Saxon or English period, must
    rest covered up many curious remains of the Roman, as well as of the
    later periods. Some of these are, from time to time, laid bare in the
    formation of sewers, but the unburied remains of Roman work seem to
    be confined to one tower and the adjacent wall, and fragments of the
    wall in another part of the city. The Multangular Tower, forming one
    corner of the Roman area, is a shell of masonry, 42 feet in exterior
    diameter, and 20 feet at the gorge, which is open. It is not placed, as
    in Norman works, so as merely to cap the junction of two walls which
    would have met at a right angle, but the whole angle is superseded,
    as in Roman works, by a curve of 50 feet radius, and the tower stands
    in the centre of this rounding, three-quarters of it, presenting nine
    facets, being disengaged. The tower and the contiguous walls are 5
    feet thick. The Roman part of the work is about 15 feet high. It is of
    rubble, faced with ashlar, the blocks being about 4 inches by 5 inches
    or 6 inches, very seldom more. There is one band of five courses of
    brick that may be traced along the adjacent wall, though the whole has
    been much injured and patched. Upon the Roman work has been placed an
    ashlar upper story about 3 feet thick and 12 feet high, pierced by nine
    cruciform loops, one in each face, and set in a pointed recess, an
    addition of early English or early Decorated date. The wall, extending
    south-east from the tower for 53 yards, is of the same date, style,
    and material. Both formed a part of the defences of the medi√¶val city.
    The opposite wall, running eastward, has been partially destroyed, and
    is now only 4 feet high, and at a short distance becomes buried in the
    east bank. This part of the wall was evidently destroyed before the
    earthwork was thrown up, for not only is it buried within the bank, but
    the later wall of the city is built 4 feet in front of it. It is to be
    observed that the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span> tower and wall, where perfect, are entirely
    unconnected with any bank of earth, and the ashlar facing, both inside
    and out, shows this always to have been the case. The wall stands on
    the natural surface of the ground, and is seen of equal height inside
    and outside. This feature in the Roman defences is not peculiar to
    York, but is seen at Porchester, Silchester, and elsewhere. It is
    evident that the earthworks, which form so important a feature in the
    defences of York, are all of post-Roman date. Another fragment of the
    Roman wall is seen in a private [Mr. Gray‚Äôs] garden, where it has been
    covered up by about 12 feet of <i lang="fr">d√©bris</i>, and has recently been
    laid open at a point not far from the old northern gate. Here, also,
    the wall underlies the earth-bank on which the latest wall is built.
    A third fragment of this Roman wall is exposed in a court close east
    of Monk Bar. It is about 6 feet high, and is ashlar faced, and until
    lately was covered up in the earth-bank. Probably there is still
    much of this wall still covered up, as it is thought that the level
    of the Roman city is here at least 20 feet lower down. Although so
    little of the Roman wall is seen above ground, it has been traced at
    various points, so that it may be considered as established that it
    included the whole area; that there were four angle towers, and four
    main gates, of which Bootham Bar represents one, though no trace of
    Roman work appears in the medi√¶val structure, which, indeed, probably
    stands at a much higher level than its Roman predecessor. The line of
    road from this bar is Roman, and led to Isurium or Aldborough. Of the
    other three gates, the position has been ascertained by excavation.
    That between Monk Bar and Mr. Gray‚Äôs garden was on the road leading
    to Derventio or Stamford Bridge. Another was in Low Petergate, close
    to Christ‚Äôs Church, on the road leading to Pr√¶torium or Brough on the
    Humber. This road crosses the later way at Walmgate Bar. A fourth
    gate was at the bottom of Stonegate, in front of the Mansion-house,
    upon a way which traversed the site of the present Guildhall, crossed
    the Ouse at that point by a bridge, and, passing through the site of
    the later Micklegate Bar, proceeded in a direct line towards Calcaria
    or Tadcaster. Besides the fragments of the wall, various other Roman
    remains have been discovered below the present surface, all of which
    are shown in the admirable antiquarian map of the city by Mr. Skaif.
    Beyond the river, and outside the military post, other remains of Roman
    buildings have also been found, and more especially may be mentioned
    a pavement laid open just within Micklegate Bar, in the lane leading
    towards the station. This is particularly important, because it lay
    under the earth-bank of the city wall, and proves that here also this
    bank is post-Roman. Besides these remains, situate either within the
    Roman fortification or within the area of the later city, there have
    been found other remains scattered over a wider area. Of these the
    most important are the cemeteries which are found at Clementhorpe, all
    along the Tadcaster road, and upon the ground between that road and
    the Ouse, now being excavated for the proposed railway station. Also,
    on the north side of the river, in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span> of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary‚Äôs and the Almery
    Garth, are traces of burials, the excavations over all which area have
    been carefully watched by Mr. Raine and others; these discoveries
    have created and enriched the very valuable Museum of the Yorkshire
    Society. What is incontestably shown by all these discoveries is that
    the Roman Eboracum far exceeded the bounds of the military post, and
    had thrown out suburbs in every available direction far beyond any
    military defences, showing that the inhabitants were numerous and rich,
    and lived entirely free from any apprehensions of danger. Although the
    Foss is most certainly a natural river, and not, as was once supposed,
    a Roman cut, it seems probable, from its name, that the Romans either
    altered its course or converted it into a large basin below the city,
    just above its junction with the Ouse. It is more than probable that
    the Romans here received and stored their supplies of corn, and that
    much of the commerce of the city in its palmy and very flourishing
    period was here carried on. It seems not improbable that much of the
    low land on the left bank of the river was then a part of the basin,
    though now, since the construction of the castle weir, silted up and
    reclaimed.</p>

  <p>The Roman armies were officially withdrawn from Britain in
    <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 426‚Äì430, and Eboracum, falling into the hands of its
    but very imperfectly Romanised British inhabitants, became once more
    Caer-Evrawc. Doubtless, up to that period the Roman buildings, public
    and private, churches, basilic√¶, and domestic dwellings were perfect,
    nor is it probable that the Britons, tinctured with Roman blood and
    used to Roman customs, would have injured them; but that they were
    destroyed, and buried deep in their own ruins before the existing
    earthworks were thrown up, is certain. By whom, then, and at what
    period, and as a defence against whom, were these earthworks formed?
    To answer this question it will be convenient, in the first place,
    to describe them. These earthworks are, probably, of at least two
    periods; those upon the right and left bank of the Ouse, and those
    beyond or upon the Foss, and it is with the former that we have first
    to do. A ridge or bank of earth from 15 to 40 feet high and of breadth
    proportionate, was carried round most of the area to be defended,
    and at its exterior foot was excavated a deep and broad ditch, the
    contents of which formed the bank; and this ditch, where not at too
    high a level, was supplied with water from the Ouse. This new earthwork
    included a space of about three times the area of the Roman station
    and probably as large as the latest extension of the Roman city. The
    new area, though not, like the Roman enclosure, rigidly rectangular,
    was more or less so, and for the most part contained within straight
    lines, meeting at right angles or nearly so. As the wall and tower at
    the south-west angle were standing, and more or less perfect, they
    were accepted as part of the new defence; but, from the wall to the
    Ouse, a bank and ditch were carried straight to what is now know as
    Lendal Tower. In the opposite direction, as the Roman wall was broken
    down, the bank was heaped up over it, and so continued, and probably
    still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span> contains it, along the edge of the Dean‚Äôs garden as far as the
    north-west angle. From thence, the bank, still covering up the remains
    of the wall, is continued about 600 yards in the direction of and
    beyond Monk Bar. At two points, namely, in Mr. Gray‚Äôs garden, and in a
    court opening from the bar, the skirt of the bank has been cut away,
    and the wall is seen below it. Further on, near the site of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helen‚Äôs
    Church, the wall turned at right angles, and no doubt had an angle
    tower. This, however, is gone. Here, therefore, the earthwork leaves
    the line of the Roman wall, and is continued alone for 144 yards, when
    it turns outwards nearly at a right angle, and ceases at Layerthorpe,
    on the banks of the Foss. The earthwork stopped here because it was
    no longer necessary. The Foss, then, and long afterwards, was not
    only a broad and deep, though sluggish, stream, but it was connected
    with a broad tract of marsh, neither land nor water, and in itself an
    excellent defence. Hence, therefore, the Foss seems to have been the
    boundary and defence of the new area for about 900 yards, when it flows
    towards the Ouse, including a long tongue of land, now <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George‚Äôs
    Field, and then a marsh, which was of course left outside the area.
    Probably the bank recommenced at the bend of the Foss, and was carried
    across the site of the later castle direct to the Ouse, where about
    70 yards of it are still seen, and thus, partly by the Roman wall,
    partly by an earth-bank, and partly by the river Foss, were completed
    the defences of the city north of the Ouse. South of that river, the
    bank again commences near Skeldergate, and reaches to the Bishopsgate
    angle, about 244 yards, much of which, however, is occupied by the
    later Bayle Hill. From the angle it is continued for about 750 yards
    in a nearly straight line, and then, turning at rather above a right
    angle, it is continued in two straight portions of 227 yards and 340
    yards, to the river opposite to Lendal Tower. Such are the earthworks
    north and south of the Ouse, of which there remain nearly 3,000 yards
    in length. What is their age, and by whom were they constructed? Not by
    the Romans, for they rest upon Roman buildings which had been destroyed
    and more or less buried before the earthworks were commenced. Scarcely
    by the Picts and Scots, invaders from the north, who came down, from
    time to time, in force, to burn and destroy, but never to settle or
    to construct. Scarcely by the Saxons or early English, for these
    seldom, if ever, employed straight lines in their works of defence,
    and certainly never on so large a scale. On the whole, it seems to me
    most probable that, after the withdrawal of the Roman legions, and the
    occurrence of a few destructive invasions from beyond the northern
    border, the Romanised Britons, having still much to defend, made a
    great effort to enclose their overgrown city, and, though not equal to
    so great a work in masonry, constructed an earthwork which presents,
    as was to be expected, many indications of Roman castramentation.
    Should this supposition be sound it will account not only for these
    works, but for those at Wallingford, Wareham, and Tamworth, which are
    laid out in rectangular forms, but which are not upon any great Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
    roads, present no traces of Roman occupation, and the banks and ditches
    of which are on a larger scale than was usual with the Romans, whose
    temporary works were but slight, and who employed masonry for those of
    a more permanent character. The same admixture of British with Roman
    blood and customs which produced in Ambrosius Aurelianus a chieftain
    of mixed descent, might well have manifested itself in such works as
    those of York. Of the interval between the departure of the legions and
    the first establishment of Deira as a Saxon kingdom, a period of about
    sixty years, but little has been recorded. It was the period during
    which the failing energy of the Britons once, and once only, blazed
    up, and, under the leading of the Gaulish <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germain, gained over the
    Picts and Saxons the celebrated Hallelujah victory. Probably it was
    about this time, during the first quarter of the fifth century, that
    these earthworks were executed. How the British rule was carried on,
    and what degree of civilisation was retained by the Romanised natives,
    is a matter rather of conjecture than of proof. The metropolitan
    supremacy of the city was, however, maintained, for it comes to
    light about the middle of the sixth century, no longer, indeed, as a
    Christian centre, but as the Pagan capital of Deira, under the sway of
    the Saxon Elle.</p>

  <p>In the seventh century York was still a flourishing city, and once more
    was penetrated by the leaven of Christianity. Here Paulinus in 626
    baptised the founder of Edinburgh, who here testified his faith by the
    construction of a chapel of wood, the humble predecessor of the great
    Minster of the North. The earlier churches with the Roman temples and
    basilic√¶ had no doubt long been destroyed. York had its full share
    of the calamities which drenched the land with gore during the slow
    foundation of the English Commonwealth. It was burned in 738 during the
    archbishopric of Egbert, brother to Eadbert, King of Northumbria. In
    867 it was taken by Inguar and Ubba, the sons of the Danish Lodbrog,
    who severely avenged their father‚Äôs death upon the lands watered by
    the Ouse, massacred the inhabitants and destroyed the city, which,
    though fortified, does not seem to have been vigorously defended, and
    no mention is made of the castle. Gudrum, a Danish chief who held the
    city during the absence of Inguar and Ubba, is thought still to be
    remembered by the association of his name with the principal street
    of the city. It is to this period, judging from material evidence,
    the only evidence afforded, that may most probably be attributed the
    completion of the earthworks as we now see them, upon the south-eastern
    front of the city, upon and beyond the Foss.</p>

  <p>The dangers which York had most to apprehend during the sixth, seventh,
    eighth, and ninth centuries, that is from the first appearance of the
    Vikings upon the shores of Britain, came chiefly from the east, and
    by the way of the Humber and the Ouse. Hence, the defence of the city
    on that side, and against a maritime foe, became a matter of vital
    importance to the earlier Saxon settlers, who had to defend themselves
    against a brood later from the bowels of the North, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span> possessing all
    that fierceness of which civilisation had more or less deprived their
    predecessors. The first object was to defend the river. We learn from
    the Saxon Chronicles that the English way of effecting this was to
    throw up two large mounds, one upon each bank. Thus in the eighth and
    ninth centuries they defended Nottingham, and Hertford, and Stamford,
    and Buckingham, and thus they would naturally defend York, and this
    is doubtless the origin of the Castle Hill on the left and the Bayle
    on the right bank, which may thus be attributed to the ninth century.
    These mounds are the almost invariable accompaniment of an English
    aula, or chief residence, and nowhere are they more abundant than in
    Yorkshire. The date of many of them is recorded in the Saxon Chronicle,
    and close analogy affords a clue to that of most of the others. Usually
    they have a circular ditch, proper to, and shutting off the mound,
    while on one side, also included within its proper ditch, is a base
    court or area. Tamworth, of which the date is recorded, is an excellent
    example of such a work, as is Tickhill, and, on a smaller scale,
    Barwick-in-Elmet and Laughton-en-le-Morthen. The York mounds are of the
    same character. Clifford‚Äôs Hill had, until recently, its proper ditch,
    fed from the Ouse, and isolating it from the lower ward, now disfigured
    by the assize courts and prisons, but which also had its ditches, of
    which the Foss formed and does still form a part. So also the Bayle
    Hill had its ditch, now filled up, and that this surrounded the hill,
    and was fed from the Foss, is evident to those who examine it closely,
    and observe the depression in the later wall, where it is carried over
    the filled up ditch to reach the slope of the mound. But, to complete
    the defence of the city from that side, something more was required.
    The Danes came in their own ships, and would have ascended the Foss
    and thence attacked the city. An area was therefore traced out beyond
    the Foss, and which, covering the river and flanking the Ouse, made an
    attack on that side a work of danger. The Walmgate, as the new outwork
    is called, is fortified by a curved bank, in the English manner, and
    which extends about 900 yards, resting on the marsh of the Foss island
    at the one end, and on the Foss itself at Fishergate on the other. A
    glance at the map will show how completely this front of the city was
    protected by the Walmgate works beyond the Foss, by the Foss itself,
    by the castle in its rear, and by the Bayle Hill and its connected
    works beyond the Ouse. It is remarkable that such Saxon remains of
    buildings as are found in York are contained within the two suburbs of
    Walmgate and Micklegate. Saxon interments in great numbers are found
    about the city, many laid above those of the Romans, as the British
    remains are laid below them. The suburb of Walmgate was built upon and
    traversed by a Roman road, but no Roman remains have been found within
    it. Probably it lay too low for habitations. If, on the one hand, these
    fortifications tended to repel enemies, on the other, the great wealth
    of the city operated as a still stronger attraction to invite them.
    Notwithstanding the Danish invasions and spoilings, the vitality of
    the city continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span> strong. Alcuin, who wrote in the same century in
    which lived Inguar and Ubba, commemorates its wealth and splendour, its
    love of literature (indicated by the volumes in the cathedral library),
    and its great commercial prosperity. In 923 the city fell before
    Bagnald, a Northman, and after the middle of the eleventh century,
    when Deira was passing into Yorkshire, York was again disturbed by
    the oppression of Tostig, against whom the whole province rose, and
    a gemote was held here in 1065, at which, says Freeman, both English
    and Danish blood were represented. The object of the assembly was in
    truth the breaking up of the kingdom, and the provincial movement was
    aided by the Mercians and the Welsh. Happily, however, wiser counsels
    prevailed, peace was purchased by concession, and Tostig, against
    whom the revolt was directed, was banished. The defences of York were
    once more to be tried before the coming in of the Normans. In the
    fated year 1066, Tostig, encouraged by his Norman allies, hovered
    over the English shore, and uniting with Hadrada, entered the Humber,
    and laid up their ships at Riccal, 9 miles below the city. Edwin and
    Morker left their seats at Laughton and Barwick, and mustered their
    forces at York, and the armies met at Gate-Fulford, two miles down the
    river. The two earls were beaten, and York surrendered, and agreed to
    give hostages at Stamford Bridge, though the actual handing over is
    thought to have taken place at Aldby, where a mound and foss still
    indicate the residence of the Northumbrian kings. But though the earls
    had failed, Harold was not wanting to his duty. Notwithstanding the
    impending invasion from the south, he marched at once to York, resting
    neither day nor night. He reached Tadcaster while the city was actually
    capitulating. He entered York without resistance, left it without
    delay, and fought and won the battle of Stamford Bridge. Again he
    marched through York, and upon the Derwent came up with the Norwegian
    reserve. These he put to flight; then returned, and after passing two
    days in York, again marched southward, to lay down his life for England
    at Hastings. York was thus a witness to the last and noblest effort of
    the great English leader to free his northern capital from the invader,
    and so, with her defences sorely broken down, and with but little
    military credit, she awaited the approach of the Normans. The Norman
    conquest found York a very considerable city, and if her military
    reputation at that time stood low, events showed this to be due rather
    to the want of a leader than to the absence of bravery in her citizens.
    The city was then composed of seven divisions called ‚Äúshires,‚Äù of which
    one, containing the outer Bayle, belonged to the archbishop. There were
    1,800 ‚Äú<span lang="la">Mansiones hospitat√¶</span>,‚Äù that is, houses paying customary rents,
    and two castles. William visited York for the first time in the summer
    of 1068. The citizens received him with submission, and as usual he
    ordered a castle to be built, and equally as usual the place selected
    was the mound of the existing stronghold. Its construction and defence
    were entrusted to William Malet, Robert Fitz Richard, and five hundred
    selected knights. Malet, who had dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>tinguished himself at Hastings,
    was sheriff of Yorkshire and a large landholder in the shire. At York
    William received acknowledgment of his supremacy from Malcolm of
    Scotland, √Üthelwine Bishop of Durham, and Archill a great Northumbrian
    Thane. It appears from Domesday that of the seven shires one was laid
    waste in the construction of the castle, and the houses were reduced
    from 1,800 to about 1,036. Probably the people had been allowed
    to build up to the castle ditch, and it was necessary to clear an
    esplanade around it. The submission of York was due to circumstances,
    and was apparent only. In the following year, 1069, the citizens rose
    against the Norman garrison. They were joined by Eadgar and the men of
    Northumbria, and the castle was beleaguered. Of course, little could
    have been done in so short a time towards substituting masonry for
    the lighter English works, which were probably of timber, or at best
    of walling without mortar, and Malet must have confined himself to
    strengthening the works already in existence. The position, even if
    only stockaded, was a strong one, and Malet held out until William came
    to his assistance, harried the city, defiled the minster, and punished
    the citizens. He now ordered a second castle to be constructed upon the
    Bayle Hill. That this was a mere stockade is clear from the fact that
    it was completed in eight days, before he left the city. Rapidly as the
    works were constructed, still the post must have been very strong, for
    the mound was high and steep, its ditches broad and deep, and filled
    with water from the river. But though such works were capable of being
    held safely by a few resolute men, as at Wigmore, against an army, the
    defences were familiar to the English, and would not strike them with
    the same terror as the stony and lofty keeps which the Normans had
    lately begun to build in Normandy, and which William had commenced in
    London. William Fitz Osborne was placed in charge of the second castle,
    which much resembled that recently constructed in his own earldom at
    Hereford. Even this double bridle failed to restrain the fierce spirit
    of the English. After a brief rising, which was put down by William‚Äôs
    lieutenants, the people organised a final and more serious attack.</p>

  <p>In September, 1069, the Danish fleet once more ascended the Humber.
    These allies were joined by the men of Northumbria and the English
    earls from Scotland. The rising threatened William‚Äôs throne. He
    charged Malet and Fitz Gilbert to hold firm, and received from them
    the assurance that they were safe for a year. They must have repented
    of their pledge when they beheld the whole population of the city
    mustering thick as wasps before the castle. The garrison at once fired
    the adjacent houses to clear the way for the defence, and thus burned
    a large part of the city, during which they sallied out in force. They
    were intercepted; three thousand are said to have been slain; the
    castle fell, and the commander was taken prisoner. The new defences
    were destroyed, probably by fire, and the north once more was free.
    The numbers engaged show that the garrison occupied not merely the
    mound, but the lower ward also. Unfortunately for the English, they
    had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span> leader capable of meeting William in the field. He marched
    into the east, met with, partially crushed, and partially subsidised,
    the invading Danes in the parts of Lindsey, and, such the terror of
    his name, entered York unopposed. He directed the castle again to be
    renewed, and then was carried out that wide and terrible devastation
    of the northern counties, necessary, perhaps, to enable him to hold
    England, but which has loaded his name with infamy. Upon the completion
    of his horrid task he kept the Christmas of 1069‚Äì70, amidst the
    blackened ruins of York.</p>

  <p>Christmas past, William visited Durham, put down a considerable rising
    in the country about the Tees, and, after an absence of a few weeks,
    returned, for the last time, to York. What remains at York of a
    military character can be attributed to the Conqueror, or to the period
    of his reign? Probably none whatever. It has been usual to suppose that
    immediately upon the orders of the Conqueror there were constructed
    keep and walls, such as we attribute to the Norman period. But this
    period of architecture lasted nearly to 1200, and it is probable
    that but very few of the Norman keeps were co√´val with William. The
    Normans had much to occupy them. Their masons, and sometimes even their
    materials, were imported from Normandy, and it is probable that in
    most cases, as certainly at York, the new lords availed themselves of
    such defences as they found ready to hand, and only replaced them with
    regular masonry by very slow degrees. Of the present walls only the
    inner part or core of the gateways, and a part of the wall above the
    Layerthorpe postern, present any distinct Norman features, and these
    seem late rather than early in the style. It is very difficult to avoid
    the conclusion that the defences of York, for at least a generation
    after the Conquest, were a line of palisades along the crest of the
    earth-bank, similar works about the castle and the Bayle, deep ditches,
    and gatehouses, very possibly, of masonry.</p>

  <p>And now, with a general description of the existing walls, these
    remarks are brought to a conclusion. It will be observed that the wall
    follows everywhere the line of the embankment, being built upon it,
    and, consequently, but seldom of any great height, the steep exterior
    bank and ditch being reckoned a great part of the defence. The ditch,
    indeed, is fast becoming a matter of history. A few years ago a good
    example of it covered the front of the city from the Ouse to the
    railway arch, but now the works of the new station have encroached
    most unnecessarily on the ditch, and a part of it is already filled
    up. It is curious also that the foundation of the wall is, for the
    most part, very shallow in some places, certainly not above two or
    three feet. Much of the wall, indeed, of Walmgate rests upon rude,
    slightly-pointed arches; possibly because the foundation was bad,
    similar arches are seen below the castle wall of Southampton, intended,
    like these, to be covered up. It is also to be remarked that parts of
    the wall, especially the oldest part at Layerthorpe, are not above
    two or, at the most, three feet thick, so as to afford no possibility
    of a rampart walk, without which the wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span> would, of course, be of
    little use for defence. At Layerthorpe this want has been supplied
    by an inner wall, built upon arches, and carrying the rampart walk.
    At the wall which contains the precinct of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary, meant evidently
    for defence, for which a licence was granted by Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>, it would
    seem that this rampart walk was an interior construction, or scaffold
    of timber. Where the wall is decidedly of late date, as near Lendal,
    it is much thicker, and the rampart walk is an essential part of it,
    though here the stone steps must have been supplemented below with
    either timber or a bank of earth. Layerthorpe postern seems to have
    a regular gatehouse placed upon the inner end of the bridge of the
    Foss, and forming an appropriate termination of the wall in this
    direction. Fishergate postern, a portcullised doorway of the style
    of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, seems to have been a water-gate upon the
    Foss. The adjacent square tower by which the curtain is ended seems
    in part of the same date, but to have been partly rebuilt in the
    Perpendicular period. York is fortunate in its gates, though these
    have been treated most injuriously. They contain the original Norman
    gatehouse, a small rectangular building, with a round-headed portal at
    each end, and a flat timber roof between. There was an upper story,
    now removed, and hinges for double gates. There is no portcullis, a
    defence well known to the Normans, but of which they made no great use.
    In the Decorated period these gatehouses were cased, an outer portal
    added, and a portcullis introduced at one or both ends. At Monk Bar
    the portal passage was vaulted. There was added a lofty superstructure
    with turrets or bartizans corbelled out at the angles, and lateral
    doors communicated with the adjacent curtains. Each gatehouse had, in
    advance of it, a rectangular enclosure or pen with embattled walls,
    and an outer gate opening on the further side of the ditch. Two small
    doors opened from the first floor of the gatehouse upon the walls of
    this structure, and thus was formed the barbican. The drawbridge was
    worked inside, over the ditch. One only of these barbicans remains,
    that of Walmgate; but those who wish to see other and rather earlier
    examples of this appendage will find one of a similar type at Carlisle,
    and a very fine one at Alnwick. The walls have been so patched and
    repaired that it is difficult to form an opinion concerning their age.
    They were strong enough in 1138 to hold at bay the Scottish King David,
    who laid siege to York, during the contest between Maud and Stephen,
    a short time before his defeat upon the field of Northallerton; but,
    with the slight exceptions already mentioned, their oldest parts seem
    of the Decorated period, perhaps of the reigns of Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr> and <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr>,
    or even of that of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> The charming little tops to the loops in
    the Walmgate wall can scarcely be later than Edward <abbr title="2nd">II.</abbr> Much of the
    superstructure is far later. The walls were ordered to be repaired by
    Edward <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr>, in July, 1327, before the battle of Nevill‚Äôs Cross, and
    much has been done to them even down to the present day.</p>

  <p>The Castle of York, to which the Conqueror directed his special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span>
    attention, ought, one would suppose, to retain some memorials of that
    age. This, however, is not the case. The wall in the lower ward, upon
    the Foss, may, in parts, be early in the twelfth century, but the round
    mural towers cannot be earlier than the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> Clifford‚Äôs
    Tower, indeed, the keep of the fortress, is a very interesting
    structure. Circular or polygonal keeps, such as Cardiff, or Arundel,
    or Pickering, were often of the Norman period; but the regular round
    or quatrefoiled tower, introduced largely by Philip Augustus into
    France, found its way into England, and the two principal varieties of
    castle keep of the quatrefoil pattern were at Warwick, now removed,
    and this at York. It is in plan a quatrefoil of 60 feet and 80 feet
    diameter, with walls 9 feet thick and 40 feet high, three of the angles
    above the first floor being occupied by circular turrets corbelled
    out, and the fourth by a small square projection, which contains,
    below, the entrance, and above, a small chapel, handsomely arcaded and
    embellished with the dog-tooth moulding. This keep had a ground floor
    looped all round, and a first floor with corresponding loops. Probably
    the chambers were attached to the walls, and supported upon posts and
    beams, leaving a small open court next the entrance and containing the
    wall. Two circular staircases lead to the first floor, and from thence
    to the battlements. The tower has been much injured by attempts, first
    to destroy and then to repair it. The tower itself looks of the reign
    of Richard or John. The chapel has been regarded as an addition, if
    so, it is a very early one. York Castle was notorious in the reign of
    Richard <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr>, for the dreadful tragedy perpetrated there upon and by the
    Jews in 1189. The castle was then burned, and we are told that Osbert
    de Longchamp, governor for the king, and who took up the cause of the
    Jews, rebuilt the work of Rufus in the castle. Probably this included
    the keep, very nearly as it is now seen. There was a second and very
    narrow ward outside the present castle wall, capped with low drum
    towers, apparently of the reign of Henry <abbr title="3rd">III.</abbr> or Edward <abbr title="1st">I.</abbr></p>
